REEL AROUND THE FOUNTAIN

It's time the tale was told
of how you took a child
and you made him old
Reel around the fountain
slap me on the patio
I'll take it now
Fifteen minutes with you
well, I wouldn't say no
people said that you were virtually dead
and they were so wrong
fifteen minutes with you
well, i wouldn't say no
people said that you were easily led
and they were half-right
I dreamt about you last night
and i fell out of bed twice
you can pin and mount me like a butterfly
but take me to the haven of your bed
was something that you never said
two lumps, please
you're the bee's knees
but so am I
Meet me at the fountain
shove me on the patio
I'll take it slowly
Fifteen minutes with you
oh I wouldn't say no
people see no worth in you
oh but I do

 

YOU'VE GOT EVERYTHING NOW

As merry as the days were long
I was right and you were wrong
back at the old grey school
I would win and you would lose
But you've got everything now
and what a terrible mess I've made of my life
No, I've never had a job
because I've never wanted one
I've seen you smile
but I've never really heard you laugh
So who is rich and who is poor?
I cannot say...
You are your mother's only son
and you're a desperate one
But I don't want a lover
I just want to be seen in the back of your car
A friendship sadly lost?
Well, this is true ...and yet, it's false
Did I ever tell you , by the way
I never did like your face
But you've got everything now
and what a terrible mess I've made of my life
No, I've never had a job
because I'm too shy
But I don't want a lover
I just want to be tied to the back of your car.

 

MISERABLE LIE

So, goodbye
please stay with your own kind
and I'll stay with mine
There's something against us
it's not time
So, goodbye
I know I hardly say
how much I love your casual way
but please put your tongue away
a little higher and we're well away
the dark nights are drawing in
and your humour is as black as them
I look at yours, you laugh at mine
and"love" is just a miserable lie
you have destroyed my flower like-life
not once-but twice
you have corrupt my innocent mind
not once-but twice
I know that wind-swept mystical air
it means: I'd like to see your underwear
I recognise that mystical air
it means: I'd like to see your underwear
what do we get for the trouble and pain?
just a rented room in Whalley Range
into the depths of the criminal world
I followed her...
I need advice, I need advice
because nobody ever looks at me twice
I'm just a country-mile behind
the world
I'm just a country mile behind
the whole world
so take me when you go

 

PRETTY GIRLS MAKE GRAVES

Upon the sand,upon the bay
"there is a quick and easy way" you say
before you illustrate
I'd rather state:
"I'm not the man you think I am
I'm not the man you think I am "
And Sorrow's native son
he will not smile for anyone
And pretty girls makes the graves
End of the pier, end of the bay
you tug my arm and say:"Give into lust,
give up to lust, oh heaven knows we'll
soon be dust..."
But I'm not the man you think I am
I'm not the man you think I am
And Sorrow's native son
he will not rise for anyone
And pretty girls make graves
I could have been wild and I could have been free
but Nature played this trick on me
She wants it Now
and she will not wait
but she's too rough
and I'm too delicate
Then on the sand
another man, he takes her hand
and a smile lights up her stupid face
(and well, it would)
I lost my faith in Womanhood
I lost my faith in Womanhood, I lost my faith

 

THE HAND THAT ROCKS THE CRADLE

Please don't cry
the ghost and the storm outside
will not invade this sacred shire
nor infiltrate your mind
my life down I shall lie
if the bogey-man should try
to play tricks on your sacred mind
to tease, torment and tantalise
wavering shadows loom
a piano plays in an empty room
there'll be blood on the cleaver tonight
when darkness lifts and the room is bright
I'll still be by your side
for you are all that matters
and I'll love you till the day I die
there never need to be longing in your eyes
as long as the hand that rocks the cradle is mine
ceiling shadows shimmy by
and when the wardrobe towers like a beast of prey
there's a sadness in your beautiful eyes
you're untouched, unsoiled, wonderous eyes
my life down I shall lie
should restless spirts try
to play tricks on you sacred mind
but whom I never gave a name
I just looked into his wonderous eyes
and said" never never never again"
all too soon I did return
just like a moth to a flame
so rattle my bones all over the stones
because I'm only a beggar-man whom nobody owns
see how words as old as sin
fit me like a glove I'm here and here I'll stay
together we lie, together we pray
there never need be longing in your eyes
as long as the hand that rocks the cradle is mine

 

STILL ILL

I decree today that life
is simply taking and not giving
England is mine and it owes me a living
ask me why, and I'll spit in your eye
ask me why, and I'll spit in your eye
but we cannot cling to the old dreams anymore
no, we cannot cling to the old dreams anymore
Does the body rule the mind
or does the mind rule the body?
I dunno...
Under the iron bridge we kissed
and although I ended up with sore lips
it just wasn't like the old days anymore
no, it wasn't like those days
am I still ill?
Does the body rule the mind
or does the mind rule the body ?
I dunno...
Ask me why, and I'll die
ask me why, and I'll die
and if you must go to work tomorrow
well, if I were you I wouldn't bother
for there are brighter sides to life
and I should know because I've seen them
but not very often...
under the iron bridge we kissed
and although I ended up with sore lips
it just wasn't like the old days anymore
no, it wasn't like those days
am I still ill?

 

HAND IN GLOVE

Hand in glove
the sun shines out of our behinds
no, it's not like any other love
this one is different-because it's us
Hand in glove
we can go wherever we please
and everything depends upon
how near you stand to me
And if the people stare
then the people stare
I really don't know and I really don't care
Hand in glove
the Good People laugh
yes, we may be hidden by rags
but we have something they'll never have
So, hand in glove I stake my claim
I'll fight to the last breath
If they dare touch a hair on your head
I'll fight to the last breath
The Good Life is out there, somewhere
so stay on my arm, you little charmer
But I know my luck too well
and I'll probably never see you again.

 

WHAT DIFFERENCE DOES IT MAKE?

All men have secrets and here is mine
so let it be known
we have been through hell and high tide,
I can surely rely on you?
and yet you start to recoil,
heavy words are so lightly thrown
but still I'd leap in front of a flying bullet for you
So, what difference does it make?
so, what difference does it make?
it makes none
but you have gone
and you must be looking very old tonight
The devil will find work for idle hands to do
I stole and I lied, and why?
because you asked me to!
but now you make feel so ashamed
because I've only got two hands
well, I'm still fond of you
So, what difference does it make?
so, what difference does it make?
it makes none
but you have gone
and your prejudice won't keep you warm tonight
So, no more apologies
no more apologies
I'm too tired
I'm too sick and tired
and I'm feeling very sick and ill today
But I'm still fond of you

 

I DON'T OWE YOU ANYTHING

Bought on stolen wine
a nod was the first step
you know very well
what was coming next
did I really walk all this way
just to hear you say
"oh I don't want to go out tonight"
but you will
for you must
I don't owe you anything
but you owe me something
repay me now
you should never go to them
let them come to you
just like I do
you should not go to them
let them come to you
just like I do
Too freely on your lips
words prematurely said
oh but I know what will make you smile tonight
Life is never kind
life is never kind
oh but I know what will make you smile tonight

 

SUFFER LITTLE CHILDREN

Over the moors,take me to the moors
dig a shallow grave
and I'll lay me down
Lesley-Anne, with your pretty white beads
oh John, you'll never be a man
and you'll never see your home again
oh Manchester, so much to answer for
Edward, see those alluring lights?
tonight will be your very last night
a woman said "I know my son is dead
I'll never rest my hands on his scared head"
Hindley wakes and Hindley says:
"Wherever he has gone, I have gone "
But fresh lilaced moorland fields
cannot hide the stoild stench of death
Hindley wakes and Hindley says:
"Whatever he has done, I have done"
But this is no easy ride
for a child cries
"find me...find me, nothing more
we're on a sullen misty moor
we may be dead and we may be gone
but we will be right by your side
until the day you die
this is no easy ride
we will haunt you when you laugh
yes, you could say we're a team
you might sleep
BUT YOU WILL NEVER DREAM!"
Oh Manchester, so much to answer for
Oh Manchester, so much to answer for
Over the moor, I'm on the moor
the child is on the moor

 

THE HEADMASTER RITUAL

Belligerent ghouls
run Manchester schools
spineless swines
cemented mines
Sir leads the troops
jealous of youth
same old suit since 1962
he does the military two-step
down the nape of my neck
I wanna go home
I don't want to stay

is a bad mistake
mid-week on the playing fields
Sir thwacks you on the knees
knees you in the groin
elbow in the face
I wanna go home
I don't want to stay
Belligerent ghouls
run Manchester schools
spineless bastards all
Sir leads the troops
jealous of youth
same old jokes since 1902
he does the military two-step
down the nape of my neck
I wanna go home
I don't want to stay
give up life
as a bad mistake
please excuse me from gym
I've got this terrible cold coming on
he grabs and devours
he kicks me in the showers
kicks me in the showers
and he grabs and devours
I wanna go home
I don't want to stay

 

RUSHOLME RUFFIANS

The last night at the fair
by the big wheel generator
a boy is stabbed
and his money is grabbed
and the air hangs heavy like a dulling wine
she is famous
she is funny
an engagement ring
doesn't mean a thing
to a mind consumed by brass(money)
and though I walk home alone
my faith in love is still devout
the last night at the fair
from a seat on a whirling waltzer
her skirt ascends for a watching eye
it's a hideous trait( on her mother's side)
and though I walk home alone
my faith in love is still devout
then someone falls in love
and someone's beaten up
and the senses being dulled are mine

this is the last night of the fair

of a speedway operator
is all a tremulous heart requires
a schoolgirl is denied
she said "How quickly would I die
if I jumped from the top of the parachutes?"

I WANT THE ONE I CAN'T HAVE

On the day that your mentality
catches up with your biology
I want the one I can't have
and it's driving me mad
it's written all over my face
A double-bed
and a stalwart lover, for sure
these are the riches of the poor
A double-bed
and a stalwart lover, for sure
these are the riches of the poor
a tough kid who sometimes swallows nails
raised on Prisoner's Aid
he killed a policeman when he was thirteen
and somehow that really impressed me
it's written all over my face
On the day that your mentality
catches up with your biology
And if you ever need self-validation
just meet me in the alley by the
railway-station
it's written all over my face

 

WHAT SHE SAID

What she said:
"How come someone hasn't noticed
that I'm dead
and decided to bury me
God knows, I'm ready"
What she said was
but then, all the rejection she's had
to pretend to be happy
could only be idiocy
What she said was not for the job or
lover that she never had
What she read
all heady books
she'd sit and prophesise
(it took a tattoed boy from Birkenhead
to really really open her eyes)

THAT JOKE ISN'T FUNNY ANYMORE

Park the car at the side of the road
you should know
time's tide will smother you
and I will too
when you laugh about other people who feel so
very lonely
their only desire is to die
well I'm afraid
it doesn't make me smile
I wish I could laugh
but that joke isn't funny anymore
it's too close to home and it's too near the bone
it's too close to home and it's too near the bone
more than you'll ever know
It was dark as I drove the point home
and on cold leather seats
well, it suddenly struck me
I just might die with a smile on my
face after all
I've seen this happen in other people's lives
and now it's happening in mine

 

NOWHERE FAST

I'd like to drop my trousers to the world
I am a man of means(of slender means)
each household appliance
is like a new science in my town
and if a day came when I felt a natural emotion
I'd get such a shock I'd probably jump in the ocean
and when a train goes by
it's such a sad sound
I'd like to drop my trousers to the Queen
every sensible child will know what this means
the poor and the needy
are selfish and greedy on her terms
and if the day came when I felt a natural emotion
I'd get such a shock I'd probably jump in the ocean
and when a train goes by
it's such a sad song
And when I'm lying in my bed
I think about life
and I think about death
and neither one particularly appeals to me
and if the day came when I felt a natural emotion
I'd get such a shock I'd probably lie
in the middle of the street and die
I'd lie down and die

 

WELL I WONDER

Well I wonder
do you hear me when you sleep?
I hoarsely cry
Well I wonder
do you see me when we pass?
I half-die
Please keep me in mind
please keep me in mind
Gasping-but somehow still alive
this is the fierce last stand of all I am
Gasping-dying-but somehow still alive
this is the final stand of all I am
Please keep me in mind

 

BARBARISM BEGINS AT HOME

Unruly boys
who will not grow up
must be taken in hand
Unruly girls
who will not settle down
they must be taken in hand
A crack on the head
is what you get for not asking
and a crack on the head
is what you get for asking

 

MEAT IS MURDER

Heifer whines could be human cries
closer comes the screaming knife
this beautiful creature must die
this beautiful creature must die
a death for no reason
and death for reason is MURDER
and the flesh you so fancifully fry
is not succulent, tasty or nice
it's death for no reason
and death for no reason is MURDER
and the calf that you carve with a smile
is MURDER
and the turkey you festively slice
is MURDER
do you know how animals die?
kitchen aroma aren't very homely
it's not "comforting," "cheery" or kind
it's sizzling blood and the unholy stench
of MURDER
it's not "natural," "normal" or kind
the fleas you so fancifully fry
as you savour the flavour
of MURDER
NO, NO, NO, IT'S MURDER
NO, NO, NO, IT'S MURDER
who hears when animals cry?

 

THE QUEEN IS DEAD

Farewell to this lands cheerless marches
hemmed in like a boar between arches
her very Lowness with her head in a sling
Im truely sorry-but it sounds like a wonderful thing
dear Charles, dont you ever crave
to appear on the front of the Daily mail
dressed in your Mother's bridal veil?
So, I checked all the registered historical facts
and I was shocked into shame to discover
how Im the 18th pale descendent
of some, old queen or other
has the world changed, or have I changed?
has the world changed, or have I changed?
as some 9-year old tough peddles drugs
(I never even knew what drugs were)
And so, I broke into the Palace
with a sponge and a rusty spanner
she said: "Eh, I know you, and you cannot sing"
I said: "that's nothing -you should hear me play piano"
We can go for a walk where it's quiet and dry
and we can talk about precious things
but when you are tied to your mother's apron
not one talks about castration
We can go for a walk where it's quiet and dry
and we can talk about precious things
like love and law and poverty
these are the things that kill me
We can go for a walk where it's quiet and dry
and we can talk about precious things
but the rain that flattens my hair
theses are the things that kill me
Passed the Pub that saps your body
and the church who'll snatch your money
the Queen is dead, boys
and it's so lonely on a limb
Pass the Pub that wrecks your body
and the church-all they want is your money
the Queen is dead, boys`
you can trust me, boys
life is very long, when you're lonely
life is very long, when you're lonely...

 

FRANKLY MR.SHANKLY

Frankly, Mr Shankly, this position Ive held
it pays my way, but it corrodes my soul
I want to leave you will not miss me
I want to go down in musical history
Frankly, Mr Shankly, Im a sickening wreck
Ive got the 21st Century breathing down my neck
I must move fast, you understand me
I want to go down in celluloid history
Fame, Fame, fatal Fame
it can play hideous tricks on the brain
but still I rather be Famous
than righteous or holy, any day
but sometimes Id feel more fulfilled
making Christmas cards with the mentally ill
I want to Live and I want to Love
I want to catch something that I might be ashamed of
Frankly, Mr Shankly, this position I've held
it pays my way and it corrodes my soul
oh, I didnt realise that you wrote poetry
(I didnt realise you wrote such bloody awful poetry)
Frankly, Mr Shankly, since you ask
you are a flatulent pain the arse
I do not mean to be so rude
but still, I must speck frankly, Mr Shankly

 

I KNOW IT'S ALL OVER

Oh Mother, I can fell the soil falling over my head
and as i climb into an empty bed
Oh well, Enough said
I know it's over-still I cling
I don't know where else I can go
Oh Mother, I can feel the soil falling over my head
see, the sea want s to take me
the knife wants to cut me
do you think you can help me?
Sad veiled bride, please be happy
handsome groom, give her room
loud, loutish lover, treat her kindly
(although she needs you
more than she loves you)
and I know it's over
and it never really began
but in my heart it was so real
and you even spoke to me and said:
"If you're so funny
then why are you on your own tonight?
and if you are so clever
then why are you on your own tonight?
if you're so terribly good looking
then why do you sleep alone tonight?
because tonight is just like any other night
that's why you're on your own tonight
with your triumphs and your charms
while they are in each other's arms.."
It's so easy to laugh
it's so easy to hate
it takes strength to be gentle and kind
It's so easy to laugh
it's so easy to hate
it takes guts to be gentle and kind
love is Natural and Real
but not for you, my love
not tonight my love
love is Natural and Real
but not for such as you and I, my love
Oh Mother, I can fell the soil falling over my head
Oh Mother, I can fell the soil falling over my head...

 

NEVER HAD NO ONE EVER

When you walk without ease
on these
the very streets where you were raised
I had a really bad dream
it lasted 20 years, 7 months, and 27 days
Never had no one ever.

 

CEMETERY GATES

A dreaded sunny day
so I meet you at the cemetry gates
Keats and Yeats are on your side
A dreaded sunny day
so I meet you at the cemetry gates
Keats and Yeats are on your side
while Wilde is on mine
So we go inside and we gravely read the stones
all those people all those lives
where are they now ?
with loves, and hates
and passions just like mine
they were born
and then they lived and then they died
which seems so unfair
and I wantr to crv
You say: "ere thrice the sun hath done salutation to the dawn"
and you claim these words as your own
but Im well-read, have heard them said
a hundred times (maybe less, maybe more)
if you must write prose/poems
the words you use should be your own
dont plagiarise or take "on loans"
there's alweays someone, somewhere
with a big nose, who knows
and who trips you up and laughs
when you fall
You say: "ere long done do does did "
words which could only be your own
you then produce the text
from whence was ripped
(some dizzy whore, 1804)
A dreaded sunny day
so let's go where we're happy
so I meet you at the cemetry gates
Keats and Yeats are on your side
A dreaded sunny day
so let's go where we're wanted
so I meet you at the cemetry gates
Keats and Yeats are on your side
but you lose
because Wilde is on mine

 

BIGMOUTH STRIKES AGAIN

Sweetness, sweetness I was only joking
when I said Id like to smash every tooth
in your head
Sweetness, sweetness I was only joking
when I said by right s you should be
bludgeoned in your bed
and now I know how Joan of Arc felt
now I know how Joan of Arc felt
as the flames roseto her roman nose
and her Walkman stared to melt
Bibmouth, bigmouth
bigmouth strikes again
and Ive got no right to take my place
with the Human race
and now I know how Joan of Arc felt
now I know of Joan of Arc felt
as the flames rose to her roman nose
and her hearing aid started to melt
Bigmouth, bigmouth
bigmouth strikes again
and Ive got no right to take my place
with the Human race

 

THE BOY WITH A THORN IN HIS SIDE

The boy with the thorn in his side
behind the hatred there lies
a murderous desire for love
how can they look into my eyes
and still they dont believe me
how can they hear me say those words
and still they dont believe me
and if they don't believe me now
will they ever believe me?
and if they don't believe me now
will they ever believe me?
The boy with the thorn in his side
behind the hatred there lies
a plundering desire for love
how can they see the Love in our eyes
and still they don't believe us
and after all this time
they don't want to believe us
and if they dont believe us now
will they ever believe us ?
andd when you want to Live
how do you start ?
where do you go ?
who do you know?

 

VICAR IN A TUTU

I was minding mind business
lifting some lead off
the roof of the Holy Name church
it was worthwhile living a laughable life
just to set my eyes on a blistering sight
of a vicar in a tu-tu
he's not strange
he just wants to live his life this way
a scanty bit of a thing
with a decorative ring
that wouldn't cover the head of a child
as Rose collects the money in the cannister
who comes sliding down the bannister
the vicar in a tu-tu
he's not strange
he just wants to live his life this way
the monkish monsignor
with a head full of plaster
said "my man, get your vile soul dry-cleaned"
as Rose counts the money in the cannister
as natural as rain
he dances again
vicar in a tu-tu
The next day in the pulpit
with Freedom and Ease
combating ignoranca,dust and disease
as Rose counts the money in the cannister
as natural as rain
he dances again
the fabric of a tu-tu
any man could get us to
and I am a living sign.

 

THERE IS A LIGHT THAT NEVER GOES OUT

Take me out tonight
where there's music and there's people
who are young and alive
driving in your car
I never never want to go home
because I havent got one
anymore
take me out tonight
because I want to see people and I
want to see lights
driving in your car
oh please dont drop me home
because it's not my home, it's their
home, and Im welcome no morw
and if a double-decker bus
crashes in to us
to die by your side
such a heavenly way to die
and if a ten ton truck
kills the both of us
to die by your side
the pleasure and the privilege is mine
take me out tonight
oh take me anywhere, I dont care
and in the darken underpass
I thought Oh God, my chance has come at last
(but then a strange fear gripped me and I just couldn't ask)
take me out tonight
take me anywhere, I dont care
just driving in your car
I never never want to go home
because I havent got one
I havent got one.

 

SOME GIRLS ARE BIGGER THAN OTHERS

From the ice-age to the dole-age
there is but one concern
and I have just discover
some girls are bigger than others
some girls are bigger than others
some girls mothers are bigger than
other girls mothers
As Anthony said to Cleopatra
as he opened a crate of ale:
some girls are bigger than others
some girls are bigger than others
some girls mothers are bigger than
other girls mothers.

 

A RUSH AND A PUSH AND AND THE LAND IS OURS

HELLO
I am the ghost of Troubled Joe
hung by his pretty white neck
some eighteen months ago
I travelled to a mystical time zone
but I missed my bed
so I soon came home
they said:
"there's too much caffeine
in your bloodstream
and a lack of real spice
in your life"
I said:
"leave me alone
because I'm alright, dad
just surprised to still
be on my own...."
Ooh, but don't mention love
I'd hate the real strain of the pain again
a rush and a push and the land that
we stand on is ours
it has been before
so it shall be again
and people who are uglier than you and I
they take what they need, and leave
Ooh, but don't mention love
I'd hate the pain and the strain all over again
a rush and a push and the land that
we stand on is ours
it has been before
so why can't it be now?
and people who are weaker than you and I
they take what they want from life
Ooh, but don't mention love
no - just don't mention love!
a rush and a push and the land that
we stand on is ours
your youth may be gone
but you're still a young man
so phone me, phone me, phone me
so phone me, phone me, phone me
Ooh, I think I'm in love...
Urrgh, I think I'm in lerv

 

I STARTED SOMETHING I COULDN'T FINISH

The lanes were silent
with nothing or no one around for miles
I doused our friendly venture
with a hard-faced
three-word gesture
I started something
I forced you into a zone
and you were clearly
never meant to go
hair brushed and parted
typical me, typical me, typical me
I started something
...and now I'm not too sure
I grabbed you by the guilded beams
that's what Tradition means
and I doused another venture
with a gesture
that was...absolutely vile
I started something
forced you to a zone
and you were clearly
never meant to go
hair brushed and parted
typical me, typical me, typical me
I started something
...and now I'm not too sure
I grabbed you by the guilded beams
that's what Tradition means
and now eighteen months' hard-labour
seems...fair enough
I started something
forced you to a zone
and you were clearly
never meant to go
hair brushed and parted
typical me, typical me, typical me

DEATH OF A DISCO DANCER

The death of a disco dancer
well, it happens a lot 'round here
and if you think Peace
is a common goal
well, that goes to show
just how little you know
The death of a disco dancer
well, I'd rather not get involved
I never talk to my neighbour
I'd just rather not get involved
Love, peace and harmony?
Love, peace and harmony?
Oh, very nice, very nice, very nice, very nice
...but maybe in the next world.

 

GIRLFRIEND IN A COMA

Girlfriend in a coma, I know
I know - it's serious
Girlfriend in a coma, I know
I know - it's really serious
there wree times when I could
have 'murdered' her
(but, you know, I would hate
anything to happen to her)
NO, I DON'T WANT TO SEE HER
Do you really think
she'll pull through?
Do you really think
she'll pull through?
Girlfriend in a coma, I know
I know, it's serious
there were time when I could
have 'strangeled' her
(but, you know, I would hate
anything to happen to her)
WOULD YOU PLEASE LET ME SEE HER!
Do you really think she'll pull through?
Do you really think she'll pull through?
Let me wisper my last goodbyes
I know - IT'S SERIOUS

 

STOP ME IF YOU'VE HEARD THIS ONE BEFORE

Stop me, stop me,
stop me if you think that you've heard this one before
stop me, stop me
stop me if you think that you've heard this one before
nothing's changed
I still love you, oh I still love you
...only slightly less than I used to
I was delayed, I was way-laid
an emergency stop
I smelt the last ten seconds of life
I crashed down on the crossbar
and the pain was enough to make
a shy, bald buddhist reflect
and plan a mass-murder
who said I'd lied to her?
who said I'd lied because I never
who said I'd lied because I never
I was detained, I was restrained
he broke my spleen
he broke my knees
(and then he really laid into me)
Friday night in Out-patients
who said I'd lied to her?
who said I'd lied - because I never
who said I'd lied - because I never
Oh, so I drank one
or was it four
and when I fell on the floor
...I drank more
stop me, stop me
stop me if you think that you've heard this one before
nothing's changed
I still love you, I still love you
but only slightly
less than I used to

 

LAST NIGHT I DREAMT THAT SOMEBODY LOVED ME

Last night I dreamt
that somebody loved me
no hope - but no harm
just another false alarm
Las night I felt
real arms around me
no hope - no harm
just another false alarm
so, tell me how long
before the last one?
and tell me how long
before the right one?
this story is old - I KNOW
but it goes on
this story is old - I KNOW
but it goes on

 

UNHAPPY BIRTHDAY

I've come to wish you an unhappy birthday
I've come to wish you an unhappy birthday
because you're evil
and you lie
and if you should die
I may feel slightly sad
(but I won't cry)
Loved and lost
and some may say
when usually its Nothing
surely you're happy
it should be this way?
I say "No, I'm gonna kill my dog"
and: "May the lines sag heavy
and deep tonight XXX"

PAINT A VULGAR PICTURE

At the record company meeting
On their hands - a dead star
and ooh, the plans that they weave
and ooh, the sikening greed
At the record company meeting
on their hands - a dead star
the sycophantic slags all say:
"I knew him first, and I knew him well"
Re-issue! Re-package! Re-package!
Re-evaluate the songs
double-pack with a photograph
Extra Track (and a tacky badge)
A-list, playlist
"Please them, please them!"
"Please them! Please them!"
(sadly, THIS was your life)
but you could have said no
if you'd wanted to
you could have said no
if you'd wanted to
BPI, MTV, BBC
"Please them! Please them!"
(sadly this was your life)
but you could have said no
if you'd wanted to
you could have walked away
...couldn't you?
I touched you at the soundcheck
you had no real way of knowing
in my heart I bgged "please, take
me with you...
I don't care where you're going"
But to you I was faceless
I was fawning, I was boring
just a child from those ugly new houses
who could never begin to know
who could never really know
Best of? Most of?
Satiate the need
slip them into different sleeves!
Buy both, and be decieved
climber - new entry, re-entry
World tour! ("media whore")
"Please the Press in Belgium!"
(THIS was your life...)
and when it fails to recoup?
Well, maybe:
You just haven't earned it yet, baby
I walked a pace behind you at the soundcheck
you're just the same as I am
what makes most people feel happy
leads us headlong into harm
so, in my bedroom in those 'ugly new houses'
I dance my legs down to the knees
but me and my 'true love'
we will never meet again...
At the record company meeting
on their hands - at last! - a dead star!
but they cannot taint you in my eyes
no, they cannout touch you now
No, they cannot hurt you my darling
they cannot touch you now
but me and my 'true love'
will never meet again

 

DEATH AT ONE'S ELBOW

Ooh Glenn, don't come to the house tonight
Ooh, Glenn, don't come to the house tonight
because there's somebody here
who really really loves you
stay home
be bored
(it's crap, I KNOW)
Ooh, Glenn, don't come to the house tonight
Ooh, Glen, don't come to the house tonight
because there's somebody here
who'll take a hatchet to your ear
how the frustration renders me
hateful, Glenn!
don't come to the house tonight
don't come to the house tonight
because you'll slip on the
trail of my bespattered remains
and so, that's why
GOODBYE MY LOVE, GOODBYE MY LOVE, GOODBYE MY LOVE...
Belch

 

I WON'T SHARE YOU

I won't share you
I won't share you
with the drive and ambition
and the zeal I feel
this is my time
as the note I wrote
was read, she said
has the Perrier gone
straight to my head
or is life plainly sick and cruel, instead?
"YES!"
No-no-no-no-no-no
I won't share you
I won't share you
with the drive and the dreams inside
this is my time
Life tends to come and go
well, that's OK
just as long as you know
Life tends to come and go
well, that's OK
just as long as you know
I won't share you
I won't share you

this is my time, this is my time


THE QUEEN IS DEAD

Farewell to this lands cheerless marches
hemmed in like a boar between arches
her very Lowness with her head in a sling
Im truely sorry-but it sounds like a wonderful thing
dear Charles, dont you ever crave
to appear on the front of the Daily mail
dressed in your Mother's bridal veil?
So, I checked all the registered historical facts
and I was shocked into shame to discover
how Im the 18th pale descendent
of some, old queen or other
has the world changed, or have I changed?
has the world changed, or have I changed?
as some 9-year old tough peddles drugs
(I never even knew what drugs were)
And so, I broke into the Palace
with a sponge and a rusty spanner
she said: "Eh, I know you, and you cannot sing"
I said: "that's nothing -you should hear me play piano"
We can go for a walk where it's quiet and dry
and we can talk about precious things
but when you are tied to your mother's apron
not one talks about castration
We can go for a walk where it's quiet and dry
and we can talk about precious things
like love and law and poverty
these are the things that kill me
We can go for a walk where it's quiet and dry
and we can talk about precious things
but the rain that flattens my hair
theses are the things that kill me
Passed the Pub that saps your body
and the church who'll snatch your money
the Queen is dead, boys
and it's so lonely on a limb
Pass the Pub that wrecks your body
and the church-all they want is your money
the Queen is dead, boys`
you can trust me, boys
life is very long, when you're lonely
life is very long, when you're lonely...

 

PANIC

Panic on the streets of London
Panic on the streets of Birmingham
I wonder to myself
Could life ever be sane again
on the Leeds side-streets that you slip down
I wonder to myself
Hopes may rise on the Grasmeres
But Honey Pie, you're not safe here
So you run down
To the safety of the town
But there's Panic on the streets of Carlisle
Dublin, Dundee, Humberside
I wonder to myself
Burn down the Disco
Hang the blessed D.J.
Because the music that they constantly play
IT SAYS NOTHING TO ME ABOUT MY LIFE
Hang the blessed D.J.
Because the music they constantly play
On the Leeds side-streets that you slip down
On the provincial towns that you jog 'round
Hang the D.J.,. Hang the D.J.,.Hang the D.J...

 

VICAR IN A TUTU

I was minding mind business
lifting some lead off
the roof of the Holy Name church
it was worthwhile living a laughable life
just to set my eyes on a blistering sight
of a vicar in a tu-tu
he's not strange
he just wants to live his life this way
a scanty bit of a thing
with a decorative ring
that wouldn't cover the head of a child
as Rose collects the money in the cannister
who comes sliding down the bannister
the vicar in a tu-tu
he's not strange
he just wants to live his life this way
the monkish monsignor
with a head full of plaster
said "my man, get your vile soul dry-cleaned"
as Rose counts the money in the cannister
as natural as rain
he dances again
vicar in a tu-tu
The next day in the pulpit
with Freedom and Ease
combating ignoranca,dust and disease
as Rose counts the money in the cannister
as natural as rain
he dances again
the fabric of a tu-tu
any man could get us to
and I am a living sign.

 

ASK

Shyness is nice, but
Shyness can stop you
From doing all the things in life
That you'd like to
So, if there's something you'd like to try
ASK ME-I WON'T SAY "NO"-HOW COULD I?
Coyness is nice, but ,
Coyness can stop you
from saying all the things in
life that you want to
If there's something that you'd like to try
ASK ME-I WON'TSAY"NO"-HOW COULD I?
Spending warm, Summer days indoors
Writing fringhtening verse
To a buck-toothed girl in Luxembourg
ASK ME, ASK ME ,ASK ME, ASK ME, ASK ME ,ASK ME
Because if it's not Love
Then it's the Bomb
That will bring us together
Nature is a language-can't you read?
Nature is a language-can't you read?
ASK ME, ASK ME ,ASK ME, ASK ME, ASK ME ,ASK ME
Because if it's not Love
Then it's the Bomb
That will bring us together

 

MARIE'S THE NAME (HIS LATEST FLAME) / RUSHOLME RUFFIANS

Very old friend 
Came by today 
As he was telling everyone in town 
Of all the love that he'd just found 
And Marie's the name (of his latest flame) 
Talked and talked 
And I heard him say 
That she had the longest blackest hair 
Prettiest green eyes anywhere 
And Marie's the name (of his latest flame) 
The last night of the fair 
By the big wheel generator 
A boy is stabbed 
His money is grabbed 
And the air hangs heavy like a dulling wine 
She is Famous 
She is Funny 
An engagement ring 
Doesn't mean a thing 
To a mind consumed by brass (money), oh 
The last night of the fair 
From a seat on a whirling waltzer 
Her skirt ascends for a watching eye 
It's a hideous trait (on her mother's side)
From a seat on a whirling waltzer 
Her skirt ascends for a watching eye 
A hideous trait (on her mother's side) 
Then someone falls in love 
Someone's beaten up 
Someone's beaten up 
And the senses being dulled are mine 
And someone falls in love 
Someone's beaten up 
And the senses being dulled are mine 
This is the last night of the fair 
And the grease in the hair 
Of a speedway operator 
Is all a tremulous heart requires 
A schoolgirl is denied 
She said : "How quickly would I die 
If I jumped from the top of the parachutes ?"
This is the last night of the fair 
And the grease in the hair 
Of a speedway operator 
Is all a tremulous heart requires 
A schoolgirl is denied 
She said : "How quickly would I die 
Oh, if I jumped from the top of the parachutes ?"
...Oh, walk home alone 
I might walk home alone 
But my faith in love is still devout

 

THE BOY WITH THE THORN IN HIS SIDE

The boy with the thorn in his side
behind the hatred there lies
a murderous desire for love
how can they look into my eyes
and still they dont believe me
how can they hear me say those words
and still they dont believe me
and if they don't believe me now
will they ever believe me?
and if they don't believe me now
will they ever believe me?
The boy with the thorn in his side
behind the hatred there lies
a plundering desire for love
how can they see the Love in our eyes
and still they don't believe us
and after all this time
they don't want to believe us
and if they dont believe us now
will they ever believe us ?
andd when you want to Live
how do you start ?
where do you go ?
who do you know?

 

RUBBER RING / WHAT SHE SAID

Yeah! What she says : 
"How come someone hasn't noticed 
That I'm dead 
And decided to bury me ? 
God knows, I'm ready !"
La-la-la ... 
What she said was sad 
But then, all the rejection she's had 
To pretend to be happy 
Could only be idiocy 
La-la-la ... 
What she said was not for the job or 
Lover that she never had 
No no no ... 
What she read 
All heady books 
She'd sit and prophesise 
(It took a tattooed boy from 
Birkenhead 
To really really open her eyes)
What she read

No no no no ...

 

IS IT REALLY SO STRANGE?

I left the North 
I travelled South 
I found a tiny house 
And I can't help the way I feel 
Oh yes, you can kick me 
And you can punch me 
And you can break my face 
But you won't change the way I feel 
'Cause I love you, Oh ... 
And is it really so strange ? 
Oh, is it really so strange ? 
Oh, is it really so, really so strange ? 
I say NO, you say YES 
(and you will change your mind) 
I left the South 
I travelled North 
I got confused - I killed a horse 
I can't help the way I feel 
Oh yes, you can punch me 
And you can butt me 
And you can break my spine 
But you won't change the way I feel 
'Cause I love you, Oh ... 
And is it really so strange ? 
Oh, is it really so strange ? 
Oh, is it really so, really so strange ? 
I say NO, you say YES 
(But you will change your mind) 
I left the North again 
I travelled South again 
And I got confused - I killed a nun 
I CAN'T HELP THE WAY I FEEL 
(I lost my bag in Newport Pagnell) 
Why is the last mile the hardest mile ? 
My throat was dry, with the sun in my eyes 
And I realised, I realised 
I could never 
I could never, never, never, go back home again

 

CEMETERY GATES

A dreaded sunny day
so I meet you at the cemetry gates
Keats and Yeats are on your side
A dreaded sunny day
so I meet you at the cemetry gates
Keats and Yeats are on your side
while Wilde is on mine
So we go inside and we gravely read the stones
all those people all those lives
where are they now ?
with loves, and hates
and passions just like mine
they were born
and then they lived and then they died
which seems so unfair
and I wantr to crv
You say: "ere thrice the sun hath done salutation to the dawn"
and you claim these words as your own
but Im well-read, have heard them said
a hundred times (maybe less, maybe more)
if you must write prose/poems
the words you use should be your own
dont plagiarise or take "on loans"
there's alweays someone, somewhere
with a big nose, who knows
and who trips you up and laughs
when you fall
You say: "ere long done do does did "
words which could only be your own
you then produce the text
from whence was ripped
(some dizzy whore, 1804)
A dreaded sunny day
so let's go where we're happy
so I meet you at the cemetry gates
Keats and Yeats are on your side
A dreaded sunny day
so let's go where we're wanted
so I meet you at the cemetry gates
Keats and Yeats are on your side
but you lose
because Wilde is on mine

 

LONDON

Smoke
Lingers 'round your fingers
Train
Heave on - to Euston
Do you think you've made
The right decision this time?
You left
Your tired family grieving
And you think they're sad because you're leaving
But didn't you see the Jealousy in the eyes
Of the ones who had to stay behind?
And do you think you've made
The right decision thins time?
You left
Your girlfriend on the platform
With thei really ragged notion that you'll return
But she knows
That when he goes
He really goes
So do you think you've made
The right decision this time?

 

I KNOW IT'S OVER

I can feel the soil falling over my head 
And as I climb into an empty bed 
Oh well. Enough said. 
I know it's over - still I cling 
I don't know where else I can go 
Over ... 
Oh Mother, I can feel the soil falling over my head 
See, the sea wants to take me 
The knife wants to cut me 
Do you think you can help me ? 
Sad veiled bride, please be happy 
Handsome groom, give her room 
Loud, loutish lover, treat her kindly 
(Though she needs you 
More than she loves you) 
And I know it's over - still I cling 
I don't know where else I can go 
Over, it's over, it's over, it's over 
It's over, la ... 
I know it's over 
And it never really began 
But in my heart it was so real
And you even spoke to me, and said : 
"If you're so funny 
Then why are you on your own tonight ? 
And if you're so clever 
Then why are you on your own tonight ? 
I know ... 
'Cause tonight - it's just like any other night 
That's why you're on your own tonight 
Your triumphs and your charms 
While they're in each other's arms..."
It's so easy to laugh 
It's so easy to hate 
It takes strength to be gentle and kind 
Over, over, over, over 
It's so easy to laugh 
It's so easy to hate 
It takes guts to be gentle and kind 
Over, over 
Love is Natural and Real 
But not for you, my love 
Not tonight, my love 
Love is Natural and Real 
But not for such as you and I, my love 
Oh Mother, I can feel the soil falling over my head...
Oh Mother, I can feel the soil fall over, fall over my head 
Oh Mother, I can feel the ... fall over my ... , Oh ...

 

THE DRAIZE TRAIN

A vastly superior version of the instrumental B-side, acting as a peace 
offering to Marr (Morrissey chose the tracks for the compilation, 
and of course, receives no royalties on this track).

 

STILL ILL

I decree today that life
is simply taking and not giving
England is mine and it owes me a living
ask me why, and I'll spit in your eye
ask me why, and I'll spit in your eye
but we cannot cling to the old dreams anymore
no, we cannot cling to the old dreams anymore
Does the body rule the mind
or does the mind rule the body?
I dunno...
Under the iron bridge we kissed
and although I ended up with sore lips
it just wasn't like the old days anymore
no, it wasn't like those days
am I still ill?
Does the body rule the mind
or does the mind rule the body ?
I dunno...
Ask me why, and I'll die
ask me why, and I'll die
and if you must go to work tomorrow
well, if I were you I wouldn't bother
for there are brighter sides to life
and I should know because I've seen them
but not very often...
under the iron bridge we kissed
and although I ended up with sore lips
it just wasn't like the old days anymore
no, it wasn't like those days
am I still ill?

 

BIGMOUTH STRIKES AGAIN

Sweetness, sweetness I was only joking
when I said Id like to smash every tooth
in your head
Sweetness, sweetness I was only joking
when I said by right s you should be
bludgeoned in your bed
and now I know how Joan of Arc felt
now I know how Joan of Arc felt
as the flames roseto her roman nose
and her Walkman stared to melt
Bibmouth, bigmouth
bigmouth strikes again
and Ive got no right to take my place
with the Human race
and now I know how Joan of Arc felt
now I know of Joan of Arc felt
as the flames rose to her roman nose
and her hearing aid started to melt
Bigmouth, bigmouth
bigmouth strikes again
and Ive got no right to take my place

ALSATIAN COUSTIN

Were you and he Lovers?
and would you say so if you were?
on a forecourt
on a Friday
passing my way
Were you and he Lovers?
and if you were, then say that you were!
on a groundsheet
under canvas
with your tent-flap
open wide
A note upon his desk:
"P.S. Bring Me Home And Have Me!"
Leather elbows on a tweed coat
- Oh! -
Is THAT the best you can do?
So came his reply:
"...but on the desk is where I want you!"
So I ask (even though I know):
were you and he Lovers?

 

LITTLE MAN, WHAT NOW?

An afternoon nostalgia
television show
you spoke in silhouette
(but they couldn't name you)
although the panel were
very polite to you
but I remembered you
from Friday nights 1969
ATV - you murdered every line
too old to be a child star
too young to take leads
four seasons passed
and they AXED you
nervously juvenile
(WON'T SMILE!)
What became of you?
did that swift eclipse torture you?
a star at eighteen
and then-suddenly gone
down to a few lines
in the back page of a teenage annual
oh but I remembered you
I looked up to you

 

EVERYDAY IS LIKE SUNDAY

Trudging slowly over wet sand
back to the bench
where your clothes were stolen
this is the coastal town
that they forgot to close down
Armageddon - come Armageddon!
Come Armageddon! Come!
Everyday is like Sunday
everyday is silent and grey
Hide on the promenade
scratch out a postcard
"how I dearly with I was not here"
in the seaside town
...that they forgot to bomb
Come! Come! Come - nuclear bomb!
Everyday is like Sunday
everyday is silent and grey
Trudging back over pebbles and sand
and a strange dust lands on your hands
(and on your face)
Everyday is like Sunday
"Win Yourself A Cheap Tray"
share some greased tea with me
everyday is silent and grey

 

BENGALI IN PLATFORMS

No no no
he does not want to depress you
oh no no no no no
he only wants to impress you
Bengali in platform
she only wants to embrace your culture
and to be your friend forever
Bengali, Bengali
oh shelve your Western plans
and understand that life is hard enough when you belong here
A silver-studded rim that glistens
and an ankle-star that...blinds me
a lemon sole so very high
which only reminds me, to tell you
so I break the news gently
I break the news to you gently
"Shelve your plans"
Bengali, Bengali
its the touchy march of time
that blinds you
don't blame me
don't hate me
just because I'm the one to tell you
that life is hard enough when you belong here
life is hard enough when you belong here
shelve your western plans
life is hard enough when you belong here

 

ANGEL, ANGEL, DOWN WE GO TOGETHER

Angel, Angel
don't take your life tonight
I know they take
and that they take in turn
and they give you nothing real
for yourself in return
and when they've used you
and they've broken you
and wasted all your money
and cast your shell aside
and when they've bought you
and they've sold you
and they've billed you for the pleasure
and they've made your parents cry
I will be here
BELIEVE ME
I will be here
...believe me
Angel, don't take your life
some people have got no pride
they do not understand
the Urgency of life
but I love you more than life
I love you more than life
I love you more than life
I love you more than life

 

LALE NIGHT, MAUDLIN STREET

The last night on Maudlin Street
goodbye house
goodbye stairs
I was born here
I was raised here, and
...I took some stick here
love at first sight
may sound trite
but it's true, you know
I could list the details
of everything you ever wore
or said, or how you stood that day
and as we spend the last night
on Maudlin Street, I say
"goodbye house-forever!"
I never stole a happy hour
around here
Where the world's ugliest boy
became what you see
here I am - the ugliest man
Its the last night on Maudlin Street
and truly I do love you
oh, truly I do love you
When I sleep with that picture of
you framed beside my bed
oh, it's childish and it's silly
but I think it's you in my room
by the bed (...yes, I told you it was silly...)
and I know
I took strange pills
but I never meant to hurt you
oh truly I love you
I came home late one night
everyone had gone to bed
nobody stays up for you
when you have sixteen stitches
all around your head
the last buss I missed to Maudlin Street
so, he drove me home in the Van
complaining: "Women only like me for my mind..."
don't leave your torch behind
power-cuts ahead
as we crept through the park
but no I cannot steal a pair of jeans
off a clothesline for you
but you...without clothes
oh I could not keep a straight face
me - without clothes?
well a nation turns its back and gags...
I'm packed
I am moving house
a half-life disappears today
every slag waves me on
(secretly wishing me gone
well, I will be soon
oh - I will be soon)
There were bad times on Maudlin Street
when they took you away in a police car
dear Inspector - don't you know?
don't you care?
don't you know - about Love?
Your gran died
and your mother died
on Maudlin Street
in pain and ashamed
with never time to say
those special things
I took the keys from Maudlin Street
well, it's only bricks and mortar!
and...truly I do love you
wherever you are
wherever you are

 

SUEDHEAD

Why do you come here
why do you hang around
I'm so sorry
I'm so sorry
Why do you come here
when you know it makes
things hard for me
when you know, oh
why do you come?
Why do you telephone?
and why send me silly notes?
I'm so sorry
I'm so sorry
why do you come here
when you know it makes
thing hard for me
when you know, oh
why do you come?
You had to sneak into my room
'just' to read my diary
was it just to see all the things
you knew I'd written about you?
and...so many illustrations
I'm so very sickened
oh, I am so sickened NOW

 

BREAK UP THE FAMILY

The strange logic of your clumsiest line
stayed emblazoned on my mind
break up the family
and lets begin to live our lives
I went to see all my friends tonight
it wasn't Youth, it wasn't even Life
born Old, sadly wise
resigned (well, we were)
to ending our lives
I'm so glad to grow older
to move away from those awful times
I want to see all my friends tonight
Yes you found love but you weren't
at peace with your life
home late, full of Hate
despise the ties that bind
oh I'm so glad to grow older
to move away from those younger years
now I'm in love for the first time
and I don't feel bad
Let me see all my old friends
let me put my arm around them
because I really do love them
now, does that sound mad?
Captain of games, solid framed
I stood on the touchline
hailstones, driven home
in his car - no breaks? I don't mind
I'm just so glad to grow older
to move away from those darker years
I'm in love for the first time
and I don't feel bad
so wish me luck my friends
goodbye

 

HAIRDRESSER ON FIRE

Here is London
here is London
is it home of the free,
or what?
can you squeeze me
into an empty page of your diary
and psychologically save me
I've got faith in you
I sense the power
in the fingers
within an hour the power
can totally destroy me
or it could same my life
here is London
'home of the brash, outrageous
and free'
you are repressed
but you're remarkably dressed
is it Real?
but you're far to busy
busy scissors
busy clippers
hair dresser on fire
all around Sloane Square
and you're far too busy
to see me
"busy,busy"
hairdresser on fire
was a client over-cautious
he made you nervous
and when he said
"I'm gonna sue you"
I really felt for you
so can you squeeze me
into an empty page of your diary
and supernaturally change me
CHANGE ME, CHANGE ME

 

THE ORDINARY BOYS

Ordinary boys, happy knowing nothing
happy being no one, but themselves
Ordinary girls, supermarket clothes
who think it's very clever to be cruel to you
for you were so different
you stood all alone
and you knew
that it had to be so
avoiding ordinary boys
happy going nowhere, just around here
in their rattling cars
and ordinary girls
never seeing further
than the cold, small streets
that trap them
but you were so different
you had to say no
when those empty fools
tried to change you, and claim you
for the lair of their ordinary world
where they feel so lucky
so lucky, so lucky
with their lives laid out before them
they're so lucky, so lucky
so lucky, so lucky

 

I DON'T MIND IF YOU FORGET ME

I don't mind
I don't mind if you forget me
having learned my lesson
I never left an impression on anyone
so now you send me your hardened 'regards'
when once you'd send me 'love'
sincerely I must tell you
your mild 'best wishes'
they make me suspicious
but I don't mind
I don't mind if you forget me
having learned my lesson
I never left
an impression on anyone
the pressure to change, to move on
was strange
and very strong
so this is why I tell you
I really do understand
BYE BYE
I don't mind if you forget me
no no no no no no no
REJECTION IS ONE THING
BUT REJECTION FROM A FOOL
IS CRUEL
REJECTION IS ONE THING
BUT REJECTION FROM A FOOL
IS CRUEL
and I don't mind if you forget me
I don't mind if your forget me

 

DIAL-A-CLICHE

Further into the fog I fall
well, I was just
following you!
when you said:
"Do as I do and scrap your fey ways"
(dial-a-cliche)
"grow up, be a man, and close your mealy-mouth!"
(dial-a-cliche)
But the person underneath
where does he go?
does he slide by the wayside?
or...does he just die?
when you find that you've organized
your feelings, for people
who didn't like you then
and certainly don't like you now
yet still you say:
"Do as I do and scrap your fey ways"
(dial-a-cliche)
"grow up, be a man, and close your mealy-mouth!"
(dial-a-cliche)
"the Safe way is the only way!
there's always time to change, son!"
yes well I've changed
but I'm in pain!
dial-a-chiche

 

MARGARET ON THE GUILLOTINE

The kind people
have a wonderful dream
Margaret on the guillotine
because people like you
make me feel so tired
when will you die?
when will you die?
when will you die?
when will you die?
when will you die?
because people like you
make me feel so old inside
please die
and kind people
do not shelter this dream
make it real
make the dream real
make the dream real
make it real

 

OUR FRANK

Our frank and open
deep conversations
they get me nowhere
they bring me down, so
give it a rest, won't you?
give me a cigarette
God give me patience
just no more conversation
Give us a drink
and make it quick
or else I'm gonna be sick
sick all over
your frankly vulgar
red pullover
now see how the colours blend
Our frank and open
deep conversations
they get me nowhere
they bring me down, so
give it a rest, won't you?
now will you just give over
the world may be ending
but look, I'm only human
Give us a drink
and make it quick
or else I'm gonna be sick
all over
your frankly vulgar
red pullover
now see how the two colours blend
Won't somebody stop me
from thinking all the time
about everything
so deeply
so bleakly

 

ASIAN RUT

Day oh so late
strangely the sun still shone
oh Asian boy
what are you on?
Day oh so late
strangely the sun still shone
what drugs are you on?
Tooled-up Asian boy
has come here to avenge
the cruel, cold killing
of his very best friend
Tooled-up Asian boy
has come here to take revenge
for the cruel, cold killing
of his only friend
Peace through the school
so quiet in the hall
it's a strange sign for one
of what's to come
Tough and hard and pale
oh they may just impale you on railings
oh English boys
it must be wrong
three against one?
Brakes slammed, and
a gun jammed, and
as far as I could tell
brave Asian boy
dealt a blow and fell
I'm just passing through here
on my way to somewhere civilised
and maybe I'll even arrive
maybe I'll even arrive?

 

SING YOUR LIFE

Sing your life
any fool can think of words that rhyme
many others do
why don't you?
do you want to?
Sing your life
just walk right up to the microphone
and name
all the things that you love
all the things that you loathe
sing your life
all the things that you love
all the things that you loathe
oh sing your life
oh sing your life
Others sang your life
but now's your chance to shine
and have the pleasure of
saying what you mean
the rare pleasure of
meaning what you sing
oh, make no mistake, my friend
all of this will end
so sing it now
all the things you love
all the things you loathe
oh sing your life
all the things that you love
all the things that you loathe
oh sing your, oh sing your
Don't leave it all unsaid
somewhere in the wasteland of your head
and make no mistake, my friend
your pointless life will end
but before you go
can you look at the truth?
You have a lovely singing voice
a lovely singing voice
and all of those
who sing on key
they stole the notion
from you and me

 

MUTE WITNESS

Your poor witness
crying so loudly on the floor
oh but she's only trying to tell you
what it was that she saw
she is only trying to tell you
what it was that she saw
Now see her standing on the table
with her small arms flailing
and you feel such compassion
in your soul for
Your poor mute witness
still testing the strength
of our patience
oh but she's only trying to tell you
what it was that she saw
Now see her pointing to the frisbee
with a memory too fuzzy
as her silent words
describe the fright of last night
4 a.m. Norhtside, Clapham Common
who knows what she was doing there?
will she sketch the answer later?
Well, I'll ask her
"now dry your tears, my dear"
Now see her mime in time so nicely
it would all have been so clear
is only she had never volunteered
"your taxi is here, my dear"

 

KING LEER

Your boyfriend, he
went down on one knee
well, could it be
he's only got one knee?
I tried to surprise you
with Vodka
or, Tizer
I can't quite remember
but you didn't thank me
you didn't even thank me
because you never do
Your boyfriend, he
has the gift of the gab
or, could it be
the gift of the grab?
I tried to surprise you
I lay down beside you
and...nothing much happened
and you didn't phone me
you didn't even phone me
because it's not your style
to dial
Your boyfriend, he
displays to me
more than just
a hint of cruelty
I tried to surprise you
I crept up behind you
with a homeless chihuahua
you gushed for an hour
you handed him back and said
"You'll never guess
I'm bored now"

 

FOUND FOUND FOUND

found found found found found found
someone who's worth it
in this murkiness
someone who's never
seeming scheming
found found found found found found
someone who's worth it
in this murkiness
someone who's never
seeming scheming
Oh, but if I'd never found
oh, but if I'd never found
oh, but if I'd never found
I do believe that
the more you give your love
and I do believe that
the more you offer trust
the more you chase
the more you cry
the more you're bound to lose
the more you're bound to lose
Oh, but if I'd never found
oh, but if I'd never found
somebody
who wants to be
who wants to be
with me
all the time

 

DRIVING YOUR GIRLFRIEND HOME

I'm driving
your girlfriend home
and she's saying
how she never chose you
"turn left", she says
so I turn left
and she says
"So how did I end up
so deeply involved in
the very existence
I planned on avoiding?"
and I can't answer
I'm driving
your girlfriend home
and she's laughing
to stop herself crying
"drive on", she says
so I drive on
and she says
"So how did I end up
attached to this person
when his sense of humour
gets gradually worser?"
and I can't tell her
I'm parking
outside her home
and we're shaking hands
goodnight, so politely

 

THE HARSH TRUTH OF THE CAMERA EYE

Churchillian legs
hair barely there
the harsh truth of the camera eye
Your eyes signal pain
because of the strain
of smiling
the harsh truth of the camera eye
telling you all
that you never wnated to know
showing what
you didn't want shown
My so friendly lens
zooms into
"the inner you"
and it tells the harsh truth
and nothing but
Laugh with us all here
that's if you can
then take the pictures home
and screamtelling you all
that you never wanted to know
showing you what
you didn't want shown
This photographer
he must have really had it in for you
"Oh, I don't want
to be judged anymore
I don't wnat to be judged
I would sooner be Loved
I would sooner be
just blindly Loved..."

 

(I'M) THE END OF THE FAMILY LINE

With no complications
fifteen generations
(of mine)
all honouring Nature
until I arrive
(with incredible style)
I'm the end fo the line
the end of the family line
the end of the line
No baby pulled screaming
out into this seething whirl
by chance or whim
(or even love?)
our family tree hacked into decline
and I'm spared the pain
of ever saying
("goodbye")
I'm the end of the line
the end of the family line
the end of the line

 

THERE'S A PLACE IN HELL FOR ME AND MY FRIENDS

There is a place
reserved
for me and my friends
and when we go
we all will go
so you see
I'm never alone
there is a place
with a bit more time
and a few more
gentler words
and looking back
we do forgive
(we had no choice
we always did)
all that we hope
is that when we go
our skin
and our blood
and our bones
don't get in your way
making you ill
the way they did
when we lived
There is a place
a place in hell
reserved
for me and my friends
and if ever I
wanted to cry
then I will
because I can

 

TONY THE PONY

Still drinking on the corner 
Just don't say I didn't warn you 
Always nagging big brother 
He's only looking out for you 
Tony The Pony 
Tony The Pony 
You're still standing on the corner 
Just don't say I didn't warn you 
Old and jealous big brother 
You had your time and you spent it 
Crying 
Now, Tony The Pony 
Tony The Pony 
So, that's what they call you now ? 
When you're free outside 
So cold and hard and in control 
And ... 
There's a free ride on 
Tony The Pony 
Oh, why do you always wanna stop me 
From doing the things in life that make me happy ? 
And when I'm outside with friends, laughing loudly 
Why do you always wanna stop me ? 
Oh, I would never 
I would never 
But you will carry the can for anyone 
The free ride on 
Gullible Tony 
You're drunker quicker 
And you're sicker even quicker 
For something heavy is gonna fall on you 
Oh ... 
And what do they call you now ? 
When you're free outside 
So cold and hard and in control 
And, oh ... been a lark 
There's a free ride on 
Fucked-up Tony 
I will never say I told you so 
Or how I knew that something bad 
Would happen to you 
I don't wanna say I told you so 
Oh, but Tony, I told you so !!! 
I told you so

 

YOU'RE GONNA NEED SOMEONE ON YOUR SIDE

With the world's fate 
Resting on your shoulder 
You're gonna need 
Someone on your side 
You can't do it by yourself 
Any longer 
You're gonna need 
Someone on your side 
Someone kindly told me 
That you'd wasted 
Eight of nine lives
Oh, give yourself a break 
Before you break down 
You're gonna need someone on your side 
And here I am, And here I am 
Well, you don't need 
To look so pleased ! 
Day or night, 
There is no difference 
You're gonna need someone on your side 
Day or night, 
There is no difference 
You're gonna need someone soon 
And here I am, And here I am 
Well, you don't need 
To look so pleased

 

GLAMOROUS GLUE

First day with the jar 
You find 
Everyone lies 
First day with the jar 
You find 
Everyone lies, nobody minds 
Everyone lies 
Where is the man you respect ? 
And where is the woman you love ? 
Where's the woman you love ? 
Third week with the jar
You find 
Everything dies 
We won't vote Conservative 
Because we never have 
Everyone lies, everyone lies 
Where is the man you respect ? 
And where is the woman you love ? 
Where's the woman you love ? 
Everything of worth 
On Earth Is there To share 
I used to dream, and I used to vow 
I wouldn't dream of it now 
We look to Los Angeles 
For the language we use 
London is dead, London is dead, London is dead...
Now I'm too much in love 
I'm too much in love 
I know 
I'll go 
Empty hand 
From the land

 

WE'LL LET YOU KNOW

How sad are we ? 
And how sad have we been ? 
We'll let you know 
We'll let you know 
Oh, but only if - you're really interested 
You wonder how 
We've stayed alive 'till now 
We'll let you know 
We'll let you know 
But only if - you're really interested 
We're all smiles 
Then, honest, I swear, it's the turnstiles 
That make us hostile 
Oh ... 
We will descend 
On anyone unable to defend 
Themselves 
Oh ... 
And the songs we sing 
They're not supposed to mean a thing 
La, la, la, la ... 
Oh ...You're lonely, Oh ... you're lonely, Oh ... 
GET OFF THE ROOF ! Oh ... 
Your Arsenal !
We may seem cold, or 
We may even be 
The most depressing people you've ever known 
At heart, what's left, we sadly know 
That we are the last truly British people you'll ever know 
We are the last truly British people you will ever know 
You'll never never want to know

 

THE NATIONAL FRONT DISCO

David, the wind blows 
The wind blows ... 
Bits of your life away 
Your friends all say ... 
"Where is our boy ? Oh, we've lost our boy" 
But they should know 
Where you've gone 
Because again and again you've explained that 
You're going to ... 
Oh, you're going to ... 
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah 
England for the English ! 
England for the English ! 
David, the winds blow 
The winds blow ...
All of my dreams away 
And I still say : 
"Where is our boy ? Ah, we've lost our boy" 
But I should know 
Why you've gone 
Because again and again you've explained
You've gone to the ... 
National, ah ... 
To the National .. 
There's a country; you don't live there 
But one day you would like to 
And if you show them what you're made of 
Oh, then you might do ... 
But David, we wonder 
We wonder if the thunder 
Is ever really gonna begin 
Begin, begin 
Your mom says : 
"I've lost my boy" 
But she should know 
Why you've gone 
Because again and again you've explained 
You've gone to the : 
National 
To the National 
To the National Front Disco 
Because you want the day to come sooner 
You want the day to come sooner 
You want the day to come sooner 
When you've settled the score 
Oh, the National 
Oh, the National

 

CERTAIN PEOPLE I KNOW

I take the cue from 
Certain people I know 
I use the cue 
And then I 
Hand it on to you 
And when I swing it 
So, it catches his eye ... 
(Weren't you there ? 
- You'd have died !) 
I trust the views of 
Certain people I know 
They look at Danger 
And they 
LAUGH THEIR HEADS OFF 
Their clothes are Imitation 
George the 23rd 
(Don't you find this absurd ?) 
I'd hate to be like 
Certain people I know 
They break their necks 
And can't afford to
Get them fixed 
Ah, they'd sacrifice all 
Of their principles for 
anything cashable 
I do believe it's terrible 
Oh, wo, wo, Ah, ah, ah, ah, Oh, wo, wo...

 

WE HATE IT WHEN OUR FRIENDS BECOME SUCCESSFUL

We hate it when our friends become successful 
We hate it when our friends become successful 
Oh, look at those clothes 
Now look at that face, it's so old 
And such a video ! 
Well, it's really laughable 
Ha, ha, ha ...
We hate it when our friends become successful 
And if they're Northern, that makes it even worse
And if we can destroy them 
You bet your life we will 
Destroy them 
If we can hurt them 
Well, we may as well ... 
It's really laughable 
Ha, ha, ha ... 
You see, it should've been me 
It could've been me 
Everybody knows 
Everybody says so 
They say : 
"Ah, you have loads of songs 
So many songs 
More songs than they'd stand 
Verse 
Chorus 
Middle eight 
Break, fade 
Just listen ..."
La, la-la, la-la

 

YOU'RE THE ONE FOR ME, FATTY

SEASICK, YET STILL DOCKED

I am a poor freezingly cold soul 
So far from where 
I intended to go 
Scavenging through life's very constant lulls 
So far from where I'm determined to go 
Wish I knew the way to reach the one I love
There is no way ... 
Wish I had the charm to attract the one I love 
But you see, I've got no charm 
Mmm...
Tonight I've consumed much more than I can hold 
Oh, this is very clear to you 
And you can tell I have never really loved 
You can tell, by the way, I sleep all day
And all of my life no-one gave me anything 
No-one has ever given me anything 
My love is as sharp as a needle in your eye 
You must be such a fool 
To pass me by

 

I KNOW IT'S GONNA HAPPEN SOMEDAY

My love, wherever you are 
Whatever you are 
Don't lose faith 
I know it's gonna happen someday 
To you 
Please wait ... Please wait ... Oh ... Wait ... 
Don't lose faith 
You say that the day just never arrives 
And it's never seemed so far away 
Still, I know it's gonna happen someday 
To you 
Please wait ... 
Don't lose faith

 

TOMORROW

Tomorrow 
Will it really come ? 
And if it does come 
Will I still be Human ? 
All I ask of you is one thing that you never do 
Would you put your arms around me ? 
(I won't tell anyone) 
Tomorrow 
Does it have to come ?
All I ask of you is one thing that you'll never do 
Would you put your arms around me ? 
(I won't tell anybody) 
Tomorrow 
And what must come before ...
Oh, the pain in my arms 
Oh, the pain in my legs 
Ooh, my shiftless body 
Tomorrow 
It's surely nearer now ? 
You don't think I'll make it 
I never said I wanted to ! 
Well did I ? 
Oh, the pain in my arms 
Oh, the pain in my legs 
Oh, yeah; oh, yeah, No, yeah; no, yeah 
Through my shiftless body 
Tomorrow, Tomorrow 
All I ask of you ... oh ... 
Is : would you tell me that you love me 
Tell me, tell me that you love me, Tell me, tell me that you love me ... 
Ah, I know you don't mean it 
Ah, I know you don't mean it 
Tell me, tell me that you love me, Tell me, tell me that you love me ...

 

YOU'RE THE ONE FOR ME, FATTY

CERTAIN PEOPLE I KNOW

I take the cue from 
Certain people I know 
I use the cue And then I 
Hand it on to you 
And when I swing it 
So, it catches his eye ... 
(Weren't you there ? 
- You'd have died !) 
I trust the views of 
Certain people I know 
They look at Danger 
And they 
LAUGH THEIR HEADS OFF 
Their clothes are Imitation 
George the 23rd 
(Don't you find this absurd ?) 
I'd hate to be like 
Certain people I know 
They break their necks 
And can't afford to
Get them fixed 
Ah, they'd sacrifice all 
Of their principles for 
anything cashable 
I do believe it's terrible 
Oh, wo, wo Ah, ah, ah, ah Oh, wo, wo...

 

THE NATIONAL FRONT DISCO

David, the wind blows 
The wind blows ... 
Bits of your life away 
Your friends all say ... 
"Where is our boy ? Oh, we've lost our boy" 
But they should know 
Where you've gone 
Because again and again you've explained that 
You're going to ... 
Oh, you're going to ... 
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah 
England for the English ! 
England for the English ! 
David, the winds blow 
The winds blow ...
All of my dreams away 
And I still say : 
"Where is our boy ? Ah, we've lost our boy" 
But I should know 
Why you've gone 
Because again and again you've explained
You've gone to the ... 
National, ah ... To the National .. 
There's a country; you don't live there 
But one day you would like to 
And if you show them what you're made of 
Oh, then you might do ... 
But David, we wonder 
We wonder if the thunder 
Is ever really gonna begin 
Begin, begin 
Your mom says : 
"I've lost my boy" 
But she should know 
Why you've gone 
Because again and again you've explained 
You've gone to the : 
National, To the National 
To the National Front Disco 
Because you want the day to come sooner 
You want the day to come sooner 
You want the day to come sooner 
When you've settled the score 
Oh, the National, Oh, the National…

 

NOVEMBER SPAWNED A MONSTER

Sleep on and dream of Love
because it's the closest you will get to love
poor twisted child, so ugly, so ugly
poor twisted child, oh hug me, oh hug me
one November spawned a monster 
in the shape of this child who later cried
"But Jesus made me, so Jesus save me from
pity, sympathy and people discussing me"
a frame of useless limbs what can make GOOD
all the BAD that's been done?
And if the lights were out
could you even bear
to kiss her full on the mouth (or anywhere?)
poor twisted child, so ugly, so ugly
poor twisted child, oh hug me, oh hug me
one November spawned a monster 
in the shape of this child who must remain
a hostage to kindess and the wheels underneath her
a hostage to kindess and the wheels underneath her
a symbol of where mad, mad lovers
must PAUSE and draw the line
So sleep and dream of love
because it's the closest
you will get to love
that November is a time which I must put OUT of my mind
oh one fine day 
LET IT BE SOON
she won't be rich or beautiful
but she'll be walking your streets
in the clothes that she went out
and chose for herself

 

SEASICK, YET STILL DOCKED

I am a poor freezingly cold soul 
So far from where 
I intended to go 
Scavenging through life's very constant lulls 
So far from where I'm determined to go 
Wish I knew the way to reach the one I love
There is no way ... 
Wish I had the charm to attract the one I love 
But you see, I've got no charm

THE LOOP

I just wanna say 
I haven't been away 
I'm still right here 
Where I always was 
So one day, if you're bored 
By all means call 
Because you can do 
(But only if you want to) 
I just wanna say 
I haven't been away 
I am still right here 
Where I always was 
So one day, when you're bored 
By all means call 
Because you can do 
But you might not get through

 

SISTER I'M A POET

All over this town 
Yes, a low wind may blow 
And I can see through everybo... 
With no reason 
To hide these words I feel 
And no reason 
To talk about the books I read 
But still I do 
That's 'cause I'm a ... Sister I'm a ... 
All over this town 
Along this way 
Outside the prison gates 
I love the romance of crime 
And I wonder 
Does anybody feel the way I do ? 
And is evil just something you are 
Or something you do ? 
Sister I'm a ... Sister I'm a ... 
All over this town, All over this town 
They pull over 
In their Citroen vans 
Not to shake your hand 
With meths on their breaths 
And you with youth on your side 
A plastic bag stranded at the lights 
This once was me ...
But now I'm a ... Sister I'm a ...
All over this town ... Oh, oh, oh 
All over this town, All over this town, Oh ... 
I still cannot speak French ... I am very lazy

 

JACK THE RIPPER

Oh, you look so tired 
Mouth slack and wide 
Ill-housed and ill-advised 
Your face is as mean 
As your life has been 
Crash into my arms 
I WANT YOU 
You don't agree -
But you don't refuse 
I know you 
And I know a place 
Where no one is likely to pass 
Oh, you don't care if it's late 
And you don't care if you're lost 
And oh, you look so tired 
(But tonight you presumed too much) 
Too much, too much 
And if it's the last 
Thing I ever do 
I'M GONNA GET YOU 
Crash into my arms 
I WANT YOU 
You don't agree -
But you don't refuse 
I know you 
And no one knows a thing about my life 
I can come and go as I please 
And if I want to, I can stay 
Oh, or if I want to, I can leave 
Nobody knows me, Nobody knows me, Nobody knows me Oh, oh...

 

SUCH A LITTLE THING MAKES SUCH A BIG DIFFERENCE

Such a little thing, such a little thing
but the difference it made was grave
there you go
wielding a bicycle chain
oh why won't you change
cange and be nicer?
such a little thing
a gentle tone of kindness
or written words on paper
- can you write?
How I love all of
the very simple things of life
(God's good air)
how I love all of
the very simple things of life
such a little thing
a fumbling politeness
the difference it saved me
wielding a bicycle chain
"I WILL NOT CHANGE AND I WILL NOT BE NICE"
Most people keep their brains between your legs (don't you find?)
Leave me alone - I was only singing, leave me alone because
I was only singing
leave me alone - I was only singing, leave me alone
you have just proved (again)
MOST PEOPLE KEEP THEIR BRAINS BETWEEN THEIR LEGS

 

I KNOW IT'S GONNA HAPPEN SOMEDAY

My love, wherever you are 
Whatever you are 
Don't lose faith 
I know it's gonna happen someday 
To you 
Please wait ... 
Please wait ... 
Oh ... Wait ... 
Don't lose faith 
You say that the day just never arrives 
And it's never seemed so far away 
Still, I know it's gonna happen someday 
To you 
Please wait ... 
Don't lose faith

 

WE'LL LET YOU KNOW

How sad are we ? 
And how sad have we been ? 
We'll let you know, We'll let you know 
Oh, but only if - you're really interested 
You wonder how 
We've stayed alive 'till now 
We'll let you know, We'll let you know 
But only if - you're really interested 
We're all smiles 
Then, honest, I swear, it's the turnstiles 
That make us hostile 
Oh ... We will descend 
On anyone unable to defend 
Themselves 
Oh ... And the songs we sing 
They're not supposed to mean a thing 
La, la, la, la ... Oh ...
You're lonely, Oh ... you're lonely 
Oh ... 
GET OFF THE ROOF !
Oh ... Your Arsenal !
We may seem cold, or 
We may even be 
The most depressing people you've ever known 
At heart, what's left, we sadly know 
That we are the last truly British people you'll ever know 
We are the last truly British people you will ever know 
You'll never never want to know

 

SUEDHEAD

Why do you come here
why do you hang around
I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry
Why do you come here
when you know it makes
things hard for me
when you know, oh
why do you come?
Why do you telephone?
and why send me silly notes?
I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry
why do you come here
when you know it makes
thing hard for me
when you know, oh
why do you come?
You had to sneak into my room
'just' to read my diary
was it just to see all the things
you knew I'd written about you?
and...so many illustrations
I'm so very sickened
oh, I am so sickened NOW

 

HE KNOWS I'D LOVE TO SEE HIM

He Knows (he knows)
Or, I think he does
because when I lived
in the Arse of the world...
he knows, he knows, he knows I'd love
to see him happy (or as close as is allowed)
because when I lived
in the Arse of the world
he knows, he knows, he knows I'd love
to see him happy (or as close as possible
as close as possible, as close as is allowed)
My name still conjours up deadly deeds
and a bad taste in the mouth
the police - they actually knew me
they said:
"You're just another person in the world
you're just another fool with radical views
you're just another who has maddening views
you want to turn it on its head
by staying in bed!"
I said: "I know I do"

 

YOU'RE GONNA NEED SOMEONE ON YOUR SIDE

With the world's fate 
Resting on your shoulder 
You're gonna need 
Someone on your side 
You can't do it by yourself 
Any longer 
You're gonna need 
Someone on your side 
Someone kindly told me 
That you'd wasted 
Eight of nine lives
Oh, give yourself a break 
Before you break down 
You're gonna need someone on your side 
And here I am, And here I am 
Well, you don't need 
To look so pleased ! 
Day or night, 
There is no difference 
You're gonna need someone on your side 
Day or night, 
There is no difference 
You're gonna need someone soon 
And here I am, And here I am 
Well, you don't need 
To look so pleased

 

GLAMOROUS GLUE

First day with the jar 
You find 
Everyone lies 
First day with the jar 
You find 
Everyone lies, nobody minds, Everyone lies 
Where is the man you respect ? 
And where is the woman you love ? 
Where's the woman you love ? 
Third week with the jar
You find 
Everything dies 
We won't vote Conservative 
Because we never have 
Everyone lies, everyone lies 
Where is the man you respect ? 
And where is the woman you love ? 
Where's the woman you love ? 
Everything of worth 
On Earth, Is there, To share 
I used to dream, and I used to vow 
I wouldn't dream of it now 
We look to Los Angeles 
For the language we use 
London is dead, London is dead, London is dead, ...
Now I'm too much in love 
I'm too much in love, 
I know I'll go 
Empty hand 
From the land

NOW MY HEART IS FULL

There's gonna be some trouble 
A whole house will need re-building 
And everyone I love in the house 
Will recline on an analyst's couch quite 
Soon 
Your Father cracks a joke 
And in the usual way 
Empties the room 
Tell all of my friends 
(I don't have too many 
Just some rain-coated lovers' puny brothers)
Dallow, Spicer, Pinkie, Cubitt 
Rush to danger 
Wind up nowhere 
Patric Doonan - raised to wait 
I'm tired again, I've tried again, and 
Now my heart is full 
Now my heart is full 
And I just can't explain 
So I won't even try to
Dallow, Spicer, Pinkie, Cubitt 
Every jammy Stressford poet 
Loafing oafs in all-night chemists 
Loafing oafs in all-night chemists 
Underact - express depression 
Ah, but Bunnie I loved you 
I was tired again 
I've tried again, and 
Now my heart is full 
Now my heart is full 
And I just can't explain 
So I won't even try to 
Could you pass by ? 
Could you pass by ? 
Oh ... 
Now my heart is full 
Now my heart is full 
And I just can't explain 
So ... slow ... 
Slow ... slow ... slow ... slow ... slow ...

 

SPRING-HEELED JIM

Spring-heeled Jim winks an eye 
He'll "do", he'll never be "done to" 
He takes on whoever flew through 
"Well, it's the normal thing to do" ... ah ... 
Spring-heeled Jim lives to love 
Now kissing with his mouth full 
And his eyes on some other fool 
So many women 
His head should be spinning 
Ah, but no ! 
Ah, but no ! 
But no !
Ah, no !
Spring-heeled Jim slurs the words : 
"There's no need to be so knowing
Take life at five times the 
Average speed, like I do" 
Until Jim feels the chill 
"Oh, where did all the time go ?" 
Once always in for the kill 
Now it's too cold 
And he feels too 
old 
Too old
Mmm, old... 
La, la, la, la-la, la ...

 

BILLY BUDD

Say, Billy Budd 
So you think you should ? 
Oh, everyone's laughing 
Say, Billy Budd 
So you think that you should ? 
Everyone's laughing ! 
Since I took up with you 
Things have been bad 
Yeah, but now it's 12 years on 
Now it's 12 years on 
Yes, and I took up with you 
I took my job application 
Into town 
Did you hear ? They turned me down 
Yes, and it's all because of us 
Oh, and what was in our eyes 
Oh, what was in our eyes, yeah 
I said, Billy Budd 
I would happily lose 
Both of my legs 
I would lose both of my legs 
Oh, if it meant you could be free 
Oh, if it meant you could be free 
(Don't leave us in the dark!)

 

HOLD ON TO YOUR FRIENDS

A bond of trust 
Has been abused 
Something of value 
May be lost 
Give up your job 
Squander your cash - be rash 
Just hold on to your friends 
There are more than enough 
To fight and oppose 
Why waste good time 
Fighting the people you like 
Who will fall defending your name 
Oh, don't feel so ashamed 
To have friends 
But now you only call me 
When you're feeling depressed 
When you feel happy I'm 
So far from your mind 
My patience is stretched 
My loyalty vexed 
Oh, you're losing all of your friends 
Hold on to your friends 
Hold on to your friends 
Resist - or move on 
Be mad, be rash 
Smoke and explode 
Sell all of your clothes 
Just bear in mind : 
Oh, there just might come a time 
When you need some friends

 

THE MORE YOU IGNORE ME, THE CLOSER I GET

The more you ignore me 
The closer I get 
You're wasting your time 
The more you ignore me 
The closer I get 
You're wasting your time 
I will be 
In the bar 
With my head 
On the bar 
I am now 
A central part 
Of your mind's landscape 
Whether you care 
Or do not 
Yeah, I've made up your mind 
The more you ignore me 
The closer I get 
You're wasting your time 
The more you ignore me 
The closer I get 
You're wasting your time 
Beware !
I bear more grudges 
Than lonely high court judges 
When you sleep 
I will creep 
Into your thoughts 
Like a bad debt 
That you can't pay 
Take the easy way 
And give in 
Yeah, and let me in 
Oh, let me in 
Oh let me ... 
Oh, let me in 
IT'S WAR 
IT'S WAR 
WAR 
WAR 
Oh, let me in 
Ah, the closer I get 
Ah, you're asking for it 
Ah, the closer I get 
Ooh, the closer I ...

 

WHY DON'T YOU FIND OUT FOR YOURSELF

The sanest days are mad 
Why don't you find out for yourself ? 
Then you'll see the price 
Very closely 
Some men here 
They have a special interest 
In your career 
They wanna help you to grow 
And then syphon all your dough 
Why don't you find out for yourself ? 
Then you'll see the glass 
Hidden in the grass 
You'll never believe me, so 
Why don't you find out for yourself ? 
Sick down to my heart 
That's just the way it goes 
Some men here 
They know the full extent of 
Your distress 
They kneel and pray 
And they say : 
"Long may it last" 
Why don't you find out for yourself ?
Then you'll see the glass 
Hidden in the grass 
Bad scenes come and go 
For which you must allow 
Sick down to my heart 
That's just the way it goes 
Don't rake up my mistakes 
I know exactly what they are 
And ... what do YOU do ? 
Well ... you just SIT THERE 
I've been stabbed in the back 
So many many times 
I don't have any skin 
But that's just the way it goes

 

I AM HATED FOR LOVING

I am hated for loving 
I am hated for loving 
Anonymous call, a poison pen 
A brick in the small of the back again 
I still don't belong 
To anyone - I am mine 
And I am hated for loving 
I am haunted for wanting 
Anonymous call, a poison pen 
A brick in the ... ah ... 
A brick in the small of the back again 
I still don't belong 
To anyone - I am mine 
I am falling 
With no-one to catch me 
I am falling 
And there's still 
No-one to catch me 
Ah .. 
Anonymous call, a poison pen 
A brick in the ... ah ... 
A brick in the small of the back again 
I just don't belong 
To anywhere 
I just don't belong 
Mmm ... 
Ah ...

 

LIFEGUARD SLEEPING, GIRL DROWNING

Always looking for attention 
Always needs to be mentioned 
Who does she 
Think she should be ? 
The shrill cry through darkening air 
Doesn't she know he's 
Had such a busy day ? 
Tell her ... sshhh
Somebody tell her ... sshhh 
Slowest ... 
It was only a test 
But she swam too far 
Against the tide 
She deserves all she gets 
The sky became marked with stars 
As an out-stretched arm slowly 
Disappears 
Hooray 
Oh hooray 
No, oh, oh, woh, there's no movement 
No, oh, hooray 
Oh, hooray 
Please don't worry 
There'll be no fuss 
She was ... nobody's nothing 
(What's your name ?) 
When he awoke 
The sea was calm 
And another day passes like a dream 
There's no ... no way 
(What's your name ?)

 

USED TO BE A SWEET BOY

Used to be a sweet boy 
Holding so tightly 
To Daddy's hand 
But that was all 
In some distant land 
Blazer and tie 
And a big bright healthy smile 
Used to make all 
Of our trials worthwhile 
Used to be a sweet boy 
And I'm not to blame 
Something went wrong 
And I know 
I'm not to blame 
Something went wrong 
Can't be to blame 
Ah ...

 

THE LAZY SUNBATHERS

A world war 
Was announced 
Days ago 
But they didn't know 
The lazy sunbathers 
The lazy sunbathers 
The sun burns through 
To the planet's core 
And it isn't enough 
They want more 
Nothing 
Appears 
To be 
Between the ears of 
The lazy sunbathers 
Too jaded 
To question stagnation 
The sun burns through 
To the planet's core 
And it isn't enough 
They want more 
Religions fall 
Children shelled 
"...Children shelled ? That's all 
Very well, but would you 
Please keep the noise 
Down low ? 
Because you're waking 
The lazy sunbathers ..."
Oh, the lazy sunbathers 
The lazy sunbathers

 

SPEEDWAY

And when you slam 
Down the hammer 
Can you see it in your heart ? 
All of the rumours 
Keeping me grounded 
I never said, I never said that they were 
Completely unfounded 
So when you slam 
Down the hammer 
Can you see it in your heart ? 
Can you delve so low ? 
And when you're standing 
On my fingers 
Can you see it in your heart ? ... ah ... 
And when you try 
To break my spirit 
It won't work 
Because there's nothing left to break 
Anymore 
All of the rumours 
Keeping me grounded 
I never said, I never said that they were 
Completely unfounded 
You won't sleep 
Until the earth that wants me 
Finally has me 
Oh you've done it now 
You won't rest 
Until the hearse that becomes me 
Finally takes me 
Oh you've done it now 
And you won't smile 
Until my loving mouth 
Is shut good and proper 
FOREVER 
All of the rumours 
Keeping me grounded 
I never said, I never said that they were 
Completely unfounded 
And all those lies 
Written lies, twisted lies 
Well, they weren't lies 
They weren't lies 
They weren't lies 
I never said 
I never said 
I could have mentioned your name 
I could have dragged you in 
Guilt by implication 
By association 
I've always been true to you 
In my own strange way 
I've always been true to you 
In my own sick way 
I'll always stay true to you

 

THE TEACHERS ARE AFRAID OF THE PUPILS

There's too many people 
Planning your downfall 
When your spirit's on trial 
These nights can be frightening 
Sleep transports sadness 
To some other mid-brain 
And somebody here 
Will not be here next year 
So you stand by the board 
Full of fear and intention 
And, if you think that they're listening 
Well, you've got to be joking 
Oh, you understand change 
And you think it's essential 
But when your profession 
Is humiliation 
Say the wrong word to our children ...
We'll have you, oh yes, we'll have you 
Lay a hand on our children 
And it's never too late to have you 
Mucus on your collar 
A nail up through the staff chair 
A blade in your soap 
And you cry into your pillow 
To be finished would be a relief 
To be finished would be a relief... 
Say the wrong word to our children ...
We'll have you, oh yes, we'll have you 
Lay a hand on our children 
And it's never too late to have you 
To be finished would be a relief 
To be finished would be a relief...
I'm very glad this thing has come 
Sometimes I'm so glad 
Never bother to play the tunes 
I've seen it coming for dear life

 

READER MEET AUTHOR

You don't know a thing about their lives 
They live where you wouldn't dare to drive
You shake as you think of how they sleep 
But you write as if you are my side-by-side 
Reader, meet Author 
With the hope of hearing sense 
But you may be feeling let down 
By the words of defence 
He says : "No-one ever sees me when I cry"
You don't know a thing about their lives 
Books don't save them, books aren't Stanley knives 
And if a fight broke out here tonight 
You'd be the first away, because you're that type 
And the Year 2000 won't change anyone here 
As each fabled promise flies so fast 
You'll swear it was never there 
Oh, have you ever escaped from a shipwrecked life ? 
So safely with your software; all miles from the front line 
You hear the way their sad voices, and you start to imagine things 
Oh, any excuse to write more lies

 

THE BOY RACER

He's just too good-natured and 
He's got too much money and 
He's got too many girlfriends 
I'm jealous, that's all 
Have you seen him go, though, oh ? 
Have you seen him go, though, oh ? 
Boy racer, Boy racer, oh 
We're gonna kill this pretty thing 
Boy racer, Boy racer, oh 
We're gonna kill this pretty thing

He overspeeds and he never gets pulled over 
Have you seen him go, though, oh ? 
Have you seen him go, though, oh ? 
Boy racer, Boy racer, oh 
We're gonna kill this pretty thing 
Boy racer, Boy racer, oh 
We're gonna kill this pretty thing 
He thinks he got the whole world in his hands 
Stood at the urinal 
He thinks he got the whole world in his hands 
And I'm gonna ... kill him !
Oh, no ! Oh, no ! Oh, no ! Oh, no ! Oh, no !Oh .... 
Boy racer Boy racer, oh 
We're gonna kill this pretty thing...
He's just too good-looking, and, And, and ... 
Boy racer Boy racer, oh 
We're gonna kill this pretty thing...

 

THE OPERATION

You fight with your right hand 
And caress with your left hand 
Everyone I know is sick to death of you 
With a tear that's a mile wide 
In the kite that you're flying 
Everyone I know is sick to death of you 
Ever since 
You don't look the same 
You're just not the same, no way 
You say clever things and 
You never used to 
You don't catch what I'm saying 
When you're deafened to advice 
Everyone here is sick to the 
Back teeth of you 
With a tear that's a mile wide 
In the kite that you're flying 
Everyone here is sick to the 
Tattoo of you 
Ever since 
You don't look the same 
You're just not the same, no way 
You say pleasant things and 
There is no need to
Still, you fight with your right hand 
And caress with your left hand 
Ooh, ooh ... Sad to say ... 
How once I was in love with you 
Sad to say ... 
You don't catch what I'm saying 
When you're deafened to advice 
Ooh, ooh ... Ever since 
You don't look the same 
You're just not the same, no way 
What the hell have 
They stuck into you ?

 

DAGENHAM DAVE

Head in the clouds, and a mouthful of pie 
Head in a blouse, everybody loves him 
I see why 
Dagenham Dave, Dagenham Dave, Oh, Dagenham Dave 
Dagenham Dave, Dagenham Dave, Oh, Dagenham Dave 
"I love Karen, I love Sharon" on the windowscreen 
With never the need to fight or to question a single thing 
Dagenham Dave, Dagenham Dave Oh, Dagenham Dave 
Dagenham Dave, Dagenham Dave Oh, Dagenham Dave ...
He'd love to touch, he's afraid that he might self-combust 
I could say more, but you get the general idea 
Dagenham Dave, Dagenham Dave Dagenham Dave, Dagenham Dave 
Dagenham, Dagenham Dagenham Dave, Dagenham Dave ...
Oh, Dave, oh, Dagenham, dagenham, Oh, Dave, oh, Dave, ...

 

DO YOUR BEST AND DON'T WORRY

Compare the best of their days 
With the worst of your days 
You won't win 
With your standards so high 
And your spirits so low 
At least remember ... 
This is you on a bad day, you on a pale day 
Just do your best and don't ... Don't worry, oh 
The way you hang yourself is oh, so unfair 
See the best of how they look 
Against the worst of how you are
And again, you won't win 
With your standards so high 
And your spirits so low 
At least remember ... 
This is you on a drab day, you in a drab dress 
Just do your best and don't ... Don't worry, oh 
The way you hang yourself is oh, so unfair 
Just do your best and don't ... Don't worry, oh 
The way you watch yourself is oh, so unfair 
Just do your best and don't ... Don't worry, oh 
Do your best and don't ...

SOUTHPAW

You were a boy before you became a man 
I don't see the joy 
And you ran with your pals in the sun 
You turned around and they were gone 
Again ... 
A sick boy should be treated 
So easily defeated 
Oh, I just don't understand 
So you ran with your pals in the sun 
You turned around 
You were alone 
Again ... 
And you ran back to Ma 
Which set the pace for the rest of your days 
Oh, you ran back to Ma 
Which set the pace for the rest of your days 
Oh, you ran back to Ma 
Which set the pace for the rest of your days 
And now, there is something that you should know 
There is something that you should know 
The girl of your dreams is 
Here all alone 
Girl of your dreams is 
Here all alone 
The girl of your dreams is 
Sad and all alone 
The girl of your dreams is 
Here all alone 
There is something that you should know 
There is something that you should know 
Girl of your dreams is 
Here all alone 
The girl of your dreams is 
Sad and is all alone 
The girl of your dreams is 
Sad and is feeling all alone 
Oh, there is something that you should know 
Help me, help me, help me ...

 

MALADJUSTED

I wanna start from 
Before the beginning 
Loot wine, "Be mine, and 
Then let's stay out for the night"
Ride via Parkside 
Semi-perilous lives 
Jeer the lights in the windows 
Of all safe and stable homes 
(But wondering then, well what 
Could peace of mind be like ?)
Anyway do you want to hear 
Our story, or not ? 
As the Fulham Road lights 
Stretch and invite into the night 
From a Stevenage overspill 
We'd kill to live around 
SW6 - with someone like you 
Keep thieves' hours 
With someone like you 
...As long as it slides 
You stalk the house 
In a low-cut blouse : 
"Oh Christ, another stifled 
Friday night !"
And the Fulham Road lights 
Stretch and invite into the night 
Well, I was fifteen 
What could I know ?
When the gulf between 
All the things I need 
And the things I receive 
Is an ancient ocean 
Wide, wild, lost, uncrossed 
Still I maintain there's nothing 
Wrong with you 
You do all that you do 
Because it's all you can do 
Well, I was fifteen 
Where could I go ?
With a soul full of loathing 
For stinging bureaucracy 
Making it anything 
Other than easy 
For working girls like me 
With my hands on my head 
I flop on your bed 
With a head full of dread 
For all I've ever said 
Maladjusted, maladjusted 
Maladjusted maladjusted 
Never to be trusted 
Oh, never to be trusted 
There's nothing wrong with you, oh 
...There's nothing wrong with you

 

ALMA MATTERS

So : the choice I have made 
May seem strange to you 
But who asked you, anyway ? 
It's my life to wreck 
My own way 
You see : to someone, somewhere, oh yeah ... 
Alma matters 
In mind, body and soul 
In part, and in whole 
Because to someone, somewhere, oh yeah ... 
Alma matters 
In mind, body and soul 
In part, and in whole 
So the life I have made 
May seem wrong to you 
But, I've never been surer 
It's my life to ruin 
My own way 
You see : to someone, somewhere, oh yeah ... 
Alma matters 
In mind, body and soul 
In part, and in whole 
Because to someone, somewhere, oh yeah ... 
Alma matters 
In mind, body and soul 
In part, and in whole 
To someone, somewhere, oh yeah ... 
Alma matters 
In mind, body and soul 
Part, and in whole 
So to someone, somewhere, oh yeah ... 
Alma matters 
In mind, body and soul 
Part, and in whole 
To someone, somewhere, oh yeah ... 
Oh yeah ... Oh yeah, oh yeah Oh yeah ...

 

AMBITIOUS OUTSIDERS

Bolt-lock your doors 
Alarm your cars 
And still we move in closer 
Every day 
Top of the list 
Is your smiling kids 
But we'll be smiling too 
So that's OK 
Oh, and by the way 
Thank you, because you're 
Giving, giving, giving 
And we're receiving - 
No, no, we're taking 
Keeping the population down 
Your taxes paid, but 
Police waylaid 
And we knows 
When the school bus 
Comes and goes 
We're on your street, but 
You don't see us 
Or, if you do 
You smile and say Hello 
BUT DON'T UNDERESTIMATE US 
When you are 
Giving, giving, giving 
And we're receiving - 
No, no, we're taking 
Just keeping 
The population down 
You're giving, giving, giving 
Well, it's your own fault 
For reproducing 
We're just keeping 
The population down

 

TROUBLE LOVES ME

Trouble loves me 
Trouble needs me 
Two things 
More than you do 
Or would attempt to 
So, console me 
Otherwise, hold me 
Just when it seems like 
Everything's evened out 
And the balance 
Seems serene 
Trouble loves me 
Walks beside me 
To chide me 
Not to guide me 
It's still much more 
Than you'll do 
So, console me 
Otherwise, hold me 
Just when it seems like 
Everything's evened out 
And the balance seems serene 
See the fool I'll be 
Still running 'round 
On the flesh rampage 
Still running 'round 
Ready with ready-wit 
Still running 'round 
On the flesh rampage 
- At your age ! 
Go to Soho, oh 
Go to waste in 
The wrong arms 
Still running 'round 
Trouble loves me 
Seeks and finds me 
To charlatanize me 
Which is only 
As it should be 
Oh, please fulfill me 
Otherwise, kill me 
Show me a barrel and watch me scrape it 
Faced with the music, as always I'll face it 
In the half-light 
So English, frowning 
Then at midnight I 
Can't get you out of my head 
A disenchanted taste 
Still running 'round 
A disenchanted taste 
Still running 'round

 

PAPA JACK

Papa Jack 
Wants to turn 
Back the clock 
And reach out 
To the kids 
He once had 
Who have flown 
Papa Jack 
In decline 
Feels inclined 
To reach out 
To the kids 
He once had 
Who have flown 
But there was a time 
When the kids reached up 
And Papa Jack just 
Pushed them away 
Looking deep 
In his heart 
Papa Jack 
Doesn't like 
What he sees 
Or the time 
On his hands 
The dying day 
The chilly sun 
Papa Jack 
All alone 
Sings slow 
Grieving and low 
But there was a time 
When the kids reached up 
Now you can't always 
Have it your way 
Papa Jack 
Ah ...

 

AMMUNITION

I know these roads 
Each ridge 
And narrow bridge 
Each cheveron 
Enticing me on 
Each warning sign 
I take in my stride 
I don't need more ammunition 
I've got more than I can spend 
I don't dwell on things I'm missing 
I'm just pleased 
With the things I've found 
I know these roads 
An old hand understands 
Above all, I know what's 
Expected of me now 
Veering cliffwards 
I don't need more ammunition 
I've got more than I can spend 
I don't dwell on things I'm missing 
I'm just pleased 
With the things I've found 
With the things I've found 
With the things I've found 
I've found 
I've been crying 
It comes back on these salient days 
And it stays 
And it says : 
"We've never really been away" 
I don't need more ammunition 
I've got more than I can spend 
I don't think of who I'm missing 
I've got no space and no time 
In my life, anymore 
No space or time 
In my life, anymore 
For Revenge

 

WIDE TO RECEIVE

Download something 
Useful, or useless 
Because I'm lying here 
Wide to receive 
Almost anything 
You'd care to give 
And I don't 
Get along with myself 
And I'm not too keen 
On anyone else 
Turn on, plug in 
Then just walk away 
Unlock, process 
And then just go 
And I've never felt quite so alone 
As I do right now 
I'm lying here 
Wide to receive 
Almost anything 
You'd care to leave 
Wide, wide, wide Wide, wide, wide...

 

ROY'S KEEN

(GO ON !)
He's romancing you 
And chancing his arm 
He'll be here 
Smiling on time 
He's romancing you 
And chancing his arm 
He'll be here 
Smiling on time 
Roy's keen oh Roy's keen 
Roy's keen oh Roy's keen 
We've never seen a 
Keener window-cleaner 
Back up the ladder 
Into each corner 
Dunking the chamois 
Just think of the goodwill 
The ladder's a planet 
Roy is a star, and 
I am a satellite 
(But that's alright) 
He can hold a smile for as long 
As you require (even longer) 
He can hold a smile for as long 
As you require (even longer) 
Roy's keen oh Roy's keen 
Roy's keen oh Roy's keen 
We've never seen a 
Keener window-cleaner 
Back up the ladder 
Into each corner 
Dunking the chamois 
Just think of the goodwill 
The ladder's a planet 
Roy is a star, and 
I am a satellite 
I will be set alight 
Don't say you'll hold it steady 
Then you let it go 
Don't say you'll hold it steady 
Then you let it go Oh ...
You're up the ladder 
Into each corner 
Foot in a bucket 
We trust you to wreck it 
Even when it's under your nose 
Well, you just can't 
See it, can you ? 
Well, it's here 
Right under your nose 
And you just can't 
See it, can you? La la la la ...
Roy's keen, Roy's keen La la la la ...
We've never seen a 
Keener window-cleaner 
Oh ... La la la la ...

 

HE CRIED

I need you 
Simple words 
But words which had never been heard 
By the soul 
Stoned to death 
But still living 
And so he froze where he stood 
And he looked to the ground 
And he cried 
He cried 
Ride our minds 
If you must 
But there's always a line you don't cross 
Time is short 
Don't be cruel 
Oh you don't know the power 
In what you're saying 
Oh ... 
And so he froze where he stood 
And he looked to the ground 
And he cried 
He cried 
People where 
I come from 
They survive without feelings or blood 
I never could 
Was stoned to death 
But I'm still living 
So he froze where he stood 
And he looked to the ground 
And he cried 
He cried 
So he froze 
And he looked, and he looked 
To the ground 
And he cried 
He cried

 

SORROW WILL COME IN THE END

Legalized theft 
Leaves me bereft 
I get it straight in the neck 
(Somehow expecting no less) 
A court of justice 
With no use for Truth 
Lawyer ...liar 
Lawyer ...liar 
You pleaded and squealed 
And you think you've won 
But Sorrow will come 
To you in the end 
And as sure as my words are pure 
I praise the day that brings you pain 
Q.C.'s obsessed with sleaze 
Frantic for Fame 
They're all on the game 
They just use a different name 
You lied 
And you were believed 
By a J.P. senile and vile 
You pleaded and squealed 
And you think you've won 
But Sorrow will come 
To you in the end 
And as sure as my words are pure 
I praise the day that brings you pain 
So don't close your eyes 
Don't close your eyes 
A man who slits throats 
Has time on his hands 
And I'm gonna get you 
So don't close your eyes 
Don't ever close your eyes 
You think you've won 
OH NO

 

SATAN REJECTED MY SOUL

Satan rejected my soul 
He knows my kind 
He won't be dragged down 
He's seen my face around 
He knows Heaven doesn't seem 
To be my home 
So I must find 
Somewhere else to go 
So I must find 
Somewhere else to go 
So, take it - please 
It's free 
You'll never see 
You'll never see 
All the fun in life it's cost me 
Satan rejected my soul 
As low as he goes 
He never quite goes this low 
He's seen my face around 
He knows Heaven doesn't seem 
To be my home 
So I must find 
Somewhere else to go 
So I must find 
Somewhere else to go 
So, take it please 
It's really sly 
Come on, come on, ah Come on, come on, come on 
Take it please, It's really sly 
Come on, come on, ah Come on, come on, come on 
Call me in, Pull me in, call me in 
Come on, come on, oh Come on, come on, come on 
Pull me in, pull me in, Call me in, haul me in, pull me in 
Come on, come on, ah, Come on, come on 
La la la la la, Oh ...

 
 REEL AROUND THE FOUNTAIN

It's time the tale was told
of how you took a child
and you made him old
Reel around the fountain
slap me on the patio
I'll take it now
Fifteen minutes with you
well, I wouldn't say no
people said that you were virtually dead
and they were so wrong
fifteen minutes with you
well, i wouldn't say no
people said that you were easily led
and they were half-right
I dreamt about you last night
and i fell out of bed twice
you can pin and mount me like a butterfly
but take me to the haven of your bed
was something that you never said
two lumps, please
you're the bee's knees
but so am I
Meet me at the fountain
shove me on the patio
I'll take it slowly
Fifteen minutes with you
oh I wouldn't say no
people see no worth in you
oh but I do

 

YOU'VE GOT EVERYTHING NOW

As merry as the days were long
I was right and you were wrong
back at the old grey school
I would win and you would lose
But you've got everything now
and what a terrible mess I've made of my life
No, I've never had a job
because I've never wanted one
I've seen you smile
but I've never really heard you laugh
So who is rich and who is poor?
I cannot say...
You are your mother's only son
and you're a desperate one
But I don't want a lover
I just want to be seen in the back of your car
A friendship sadly lost?
Well, this is true ...and yet, it's false
Did I ever tell you , by the way
I never did like your face
But you've got everything now
and what a terrible mess I've made of my life
No, I've never had a job
because I'm too shy
But I don't want a lover
I just want to be tied to the back of your car.

 

MISERABLE LIE

So, goodbye
please stay with your own kind
and I'll stay with mine
There's something against us
it's not time
So, goodbye
I know I hardly say
how much I love your casual way
but please put your tongue away
a little higher and we're well away
the dark nights are drawing in
and your humour is as black as them
I look at yours, you laugh at mine
and"love" is just a miserable lie
you have destroyed my flower like-life
not once-but twice
you have corrupt my innocent mind
not once-but twice
I know that wind-swept mystical air
it means: I'd like to see your underwear
I recognise that mystical air
it means: I'd like to see your underwear
what do we get for the trouble and pain?
just a rented room in Whalley Range
into the depths of the criminal world
I followed her...
I need advice, I need advice
because nobody ever looks at me twice
I'm just a country-mile behind
the world
I'm just a country mile behind
the whole world
so take me when you go

 

PRETTY GIRLS MAKE GRAVES

Upon the sand,upon the bay
"there is a quick and easy way" you say
before you illustrate
I'd rather state:
"I'm not the man you think I am
I'm not the man you think I am "
And Sorrow's native son
he will not smile for anyone
And pretty girls makes the graves
End of the pier, end of the bay
you tug my arm and say:"Give into lust,
give up to lust, oh heaven knows we'll
soon be dust..."
But I'm not the man you think I am
I'm not the man you think I am
And Sorrow's native son
he will not rise for anyone
And pretty girls make graves
I could have been wild and I could have been free
but Nature played this trick on me
She wants it Now
and she will not wait
but she's too rough
and I'm too delicate
Then on the sand
another man, he takes her hand
and a smile lights up her stupid face
(and well, it would)
I lost my faith in Womanhood
I lost my faith in Womanhood, I lost my faith

 

THE HAND THAT ROCKS THE CRADLE

Please don't cry
the ghost and the storm outside
will not invade this sacred shire
nor infiltrate your mind
my life down I shall lie
if the bogey-man should try
to play tricks on your sacred mind
to tease, torment and tantalise
wavering shadows loom
a piano plays in an empty room
there'll be blood on the cleaver tonight
when darkness lifts and the room is bright
I'll still be by your side
for you are all that matters
and I'll love you till the day I die
there never need to be longing in your eyes
as long as the hand that rocks the cradle is mine
ceiling shadows shimmy by
and when the wardrobe towers like a beast of prey
there's a sadness in your beautiful eyes
you're untouched, unsoiled, wonderous eyes
my life down I shall lie
should restless spirts try
to play tricks on you sacred mind
but whom I never gave a name
I just looked into his wonderous eyes
and said" never never never again"
all too soon I did return
just like a moth to a flame
so rattle my bones all over the stones
because I'm only a beggar-man whom nobody owns
see how words as old as sin
fit me like a glove I'm here and here I'll stay
together we lie, together we pray
there never need be longing in your eyes
as long as the hand that rocks the cradle is mine

 

STILL ILL

I decree today that life
is simply taking and not giving
England is mine and it owes me a living
ask me why, and I'll spit in your eye
ask me why, and I'll spit in your eye
but we cannot cling to the old dreams anymore
no, we cannot cling to the old dreams anymore
Does the body rule the mind
or does the mind rule the body?
I dunno...
Under the iron bridge we kissed
and although I ended up with sore lips
it just wasn't like the old days anymore
no, it wasn't like those days
am I still ill?
Does the body rule the mind
or does the mind rule the body ?
I dunno...
Ask me why, and I'll die
ask me why, and I'll die
and if you must go to work tomorrow
well, if I were you I wouldn't bother
for there are brighter sides to life
and I should know because I've seen them
but not very often...
under the iron bridge we kissed
and although I ended up with sore lips
it just wasn't like the old days anymore
no, it wasn't like those days
am I still ill?

 

HAND IN GLOVE

Hand in glove
the sun shines out of our behinds
no, it's not like any other love
this one is different-because it's us
Hand in glove
we can go wherever we please
and everything depends upon
how near you stand to me
And if the people stare
then the people stare
I really don't know and I really don't care
Hand in glove
the Good People laugh
yes, we may be hidden by rags
but we have something they'll never have
So, hand in glove I stake my claim
I'll fight to the last breath
If they dare touch a hair on your head
I'll fight to the last breath
The Good Life is out there, somewhere
so stay on my arm, you little charmer
But I know my luck too well
and I'll probably never see you again.

 

WHAT DIFFERENCE DOES IT MAKE?

All men have secrets and here is mine
so let it be known
we have been through hell and high tide,
I can surely rely on you?
and yet you start to recoil,
heavy words are so lightly thrown
but still I'd leap in front of a flying bullet for you
So, what difference does it make?
so, what difference does it make?
it makes none
but you have gone
and you must be looking very old tonight
The devil will find work for idle hands to do
I stole and I lied, and why?
because you asked me to!
but now you make feel so ashamed
because I've only got two hands
well, I'm still fond of you
So, what difference does it make?
so, what difference does it make?
it makes none
but you have gone
and your prejudice won't keep you warm tonight
So, no more apologies
no more apologies
I'm too tired
I'm too sick and tired
and I'm feeling very sick and ill today
But I'm still fond of you

 

I DON'T OWE YOU ANYTHING

Bought on stolen wine
a nod was the first step
you know very well
what was coming next
did I really walk all this way
just to hear you say
"oh I don't want to go out tonight"
but you will
for you must
I don't owe you anything
but you owe me something
repay me now
you should never go to them
let them come to you
just like I do
you should not go to them
let them come to you
just like I do
Too freely on your lips
words prematurely said
oh but I know what will make you smile tonight
Life is never kind
life is never kind
oh but I know what will make you smile tonight

 

SUFFER LITTLE CHILDREN

Over the moors,take me to the moors
dig a shallow grave
and I'll lay me down
Lesley-Anne, with your pretty white beads
oh John, you'll never be a man
and you'll never see your home again
oh Manchester, so much to answer for
Edward, see those alluring lights?
tonight will be your very last night
a woman said "I know my son is dead
I'll never rest my hands on his scared head"
Hindley wakes and Hindley says:
"Wherever he has gone, I have gone "
But fresh lilaced moorland fields
cannot hide the stoild stench of death
Hindley wakes and Hindley says:
"Whatever he has done, I have done"
But this is no easy ride
for a child cries
"find me...find me, nothing more
we're on a sullen misty moor
we may be dead and we may be gone
but we will be right by your side
until the day you die
this is no easy ride
we will haunt you when you laugh
yes, you could say we're a team
you might sleep
BUT YOU WILL NEVER DREAM!"
Oh Manchester, so much to answer for
Oh Manchester, so much to answer for
Over the moor, I'm on the moor
the child is on the moor

 

THE HEADMASTER RITUAL

Belligerent ghouls
run Manchester schools
spineless swines
cemented mines
Sir leads the troops
jealous of youth
same old suit since 1962
he does the military two-step
down the nape of my neck
I wanna go home
I don't want to stay
give up education
is a bad mistake
mid-week on the playing fields
Sir thwacks you on the knees
knees you in the groin
elbow in the face
I wanna go home
I don't want to stay
Belligerent ghouls
run Manchester schools
spineless bastards all
Sir leads the troops
jealous of youth
same old jokes since 1902
he does the military two-step
down the nape of my neck
I wanna go home
I don't want to stay
give up life
as a bad mistake
please excuse me from gym
I've got this terrible cold coming on
he grabs and devours
he kicks me in the showers
kicks me in the showers
and he grabs and devours
I wanna go home
I don't want to stay

 

RUSHOLME RUFFIANS

The last night at the fair
by the big wheel generator
a boy is stabbed
and his money is grabbed
and the air hangs heavy like a dulling wine
she is famous
she is funny
an engagement ring
doesn't mean a thing
to a mind consumed by brass(money)
and though I walk home alone
my faith in love is still devout
the last night at the fair
from a seat on a whirling waltzer
her skirt ascends for a watching eye
it's a hideous trait( on her mother's side)
and though I walk home alone
my faith in love is still devout
then someone falls in love
and someone's beaten up
and the senses being dulled are mine

of a speedway operator
is all a tremulous heart requires
a schoolgirl is denied
she said "How quickly would I die
if I jumped from the top of the parachutes?"

I WANT THE ONE I CAN'T HAVE

On the day that your mentality
catches up with your biology
I want the one I can't have
and it's driving me mad
it's written all over my face
A double-bed
and a stalwart lover, for sure
these are the riches of the poor
A double-bed
and a stalwart lover, for sure
these are the riches of the poor
a tough kid who sometimes swallows nails
raised on Prisoner's Aid
he killed a policeman when he was thirteen
and somehow that really impressed me
it's written all over my face
On the day that your mentality
catches up with your biology
And if you ever need self-validation
just meet me in the alley by the
railway-station
it's written all over my face

 

WHAT SHE SAID

What she said:
"How come someone hasn't noticed
that I'm dead
and decided to bury me
God knows, I'm ready"
What she said was
but then, all the rejection she's had
to pretend to be happy
could only be idiocy
What she said was not for the job or
lover that she never had
What she read
all heady books
she'd sit and prophesise
(it took a tattoed boy from Birkenhead
to really really open her eyes)

THAT JOKE ISN'T FUNNY ANYMORE

Park the car at the side of the road
you should know
time's tide will smother you
and I will too
when you laugh about other people who feel so
very lonely
their only desire is to die
well I'm afraid
it doesn't make me smile
I wish I could laugh
but that joke isn't funny anymore
it's too close to home and it's too near the bone
it's too close to home and it's too near the bone
more than you'll ever know
It was dark as I drove the point home
and on cold leather seats
well, it suddenly struck me
I just might die with a smile on my
face after all
I've seen this happen in other people's lives
and now it's happening in mine

 

NOWHERE FAST

I'd like to drop my trousers to the world
I am a man of means(of slender means)
each household appliance
is like a new science in my town
and if a day came when I felt a natural emotion
I'd get such a shock I'd probably jump in the ocean
and when a train goes by
it's such a sad sound
I'd like to drop my trousers to the Queen
every sensible child will know what this means
the poor and the needy
are selfish and greedy on her terms
and if the day came when I felt a natural emotion
I'd get such a shock I'd probably jump in the ocean
and when a train goes by
it's such a sad song
And when I'm lying in my bed
I think about life
and I think about death
and neither one particularly appeals to me
and if the day came when I felt a natural emotion
I'd get such a shock I'd probably lie
in the middle of the street and die
I'd lie down and die

 

WELL I WONDER

Well I wonder
do you hear me when you sleep?
I hoarsely cry
Well I wonder
do you see me when we pass?
I half-die
Please keep me in mind
please keep me in mind
Gasping-but somehow still alive
this is the fierce last stand of all I am
Gasping-dying-but somehow still alive
this is the final stand of all I am
Please keep me in mind

 

BARBARISM BEGINS AT HOME

Unruly boys
who will not grow up
must be taken in hand
Unruly girls
who will not settle down
they must be taken in hand
A crack on the head
is what you get for not asking
and a crack on the head
is what you get for asking

 

MEAT IS MURDER

Heifer whines could be human cries
closer comes the screaming knife
this beautiful creature must die
this beautiful creature must die
a death for no reason
and death for reason is MURDER
and the flesh you so fancifully fry
is not succulent, tasty or nice
it's death for no reason
and death for no reason is MURDER
and the calf that you carve with a smile
is MURDER
and the turkey you festively slice
is MURDER
do you know how animals die?
kitchen aroma aren't very homely
it's not "comforting," "cheery" or kind
it's sizzling blood and the unholy stench
of MURDER
it's not "natural," "normal" or kind
the fleas you so fancifully fry
as you savour the flavour
of MURDER
NO, NO, NO, IT'S MURDER
NO, NO, NO, IT'S MURDER
who hears when animals cry?

 

THE QUEEN IS DEAD

Farewell to this lands cheerless marches
hemmed in like a boar between arches
her very Lowness with her head in a sling
Im truely sorry-but it sounds like a wonderful thing
dear Charles, dont you ever crave
to appear on the front of the Daily mail
dressed in your Mother's bridal veil?
So, I checked all the registered historical facts
and I was shocked into shame to discover
how Im the 18th pale descendent
of some, old queen or other
has the world changed, or have I changed?
has the world changed, or have I changed?
as some 9-year old tough peddles drugs
(I never even knew what drugs were)
And so, I broke into the Palace
with a sponge and a rusty spanner
she said: "Eh, I know you, and you cannot sing"
I said: "that's nothing -you should hear me play piano"
We can go for a walk where it's quiet and dry
and we can talk about precious things
but when you are tied to your mother's apron
not one talks about castration
We can go for a walk where it's quiet and dry
and we can talk about precious things
like love and law and poverty
these are the things that kill me
We can go for a walk where it's quiet and dry
and we can talk about precious things
but the rain that flattens my hair
theses are the things that kill me
Passed the Pub that saps your body
and the church who'll snatch your money
the Queen is dead, boys
and it's so lonely on a limb
Pass the Pub that wrecks your body
and the church-all they want is your money
the Queen is dead, boys`
you can trust me, boys
life is very long, when you're lonely
life is very long, when you're lonely...

 

FRANKLY MR.SHANKLY

Frankly, Mr Shankly, this position Ive held
it pays my way, but it corrodes my soul
I want to leave you will not miss me
I want to go down in musical history
Frankly, Mr Shankly, Im a sickening wreck
Ive got the 21st Century breathing down my neck
I must move fast, you understand me
I want to go down in celluloid history
Fame, Fame, fatal Fame
it can play hideous tricks on the brain
but still I rather be Famous
than righteous or holy, any day
but sometimes Id feel more fulfilled
making Christmas cards with the mentally ill
I want to Live and I want to Love
I want to catch something that I might be ashamed of
Frankly, Mr Shankly, this position I've held
it pays my way and it corrodes my soul
oh, I didnt realise that you wrote poetry
(I didnt realise you wrote such bloody awful poetry)
Frankly, Mr Shankly, since you ask
you are a flatulent pain the arse
I do not mean to be so rude
but still, I must speck frankly, Mr Shankly

 

I KNOW IT'S ALL OVER

Oh Mother, I can fell the soil falling over my head
and as i climb into an empty bed
Oh well, Enough said
I know it's over-still I cling
I don't know where else I can go
Oh Mother, I can feel the soil falling over my head
see, the sea want s to take me
the knife wants to cut me
do you think you can help me?
Sad veiled bride, please be happy
handsome groom, give her room
loud, loutish lover, treat her kindly
(although she needs you
more than she loves you)
and I know it's over
and it never really began
but in my heart it was so real
and you even spoke to me and said:
"If you're so funny
then why are you on your own tonight?
and if you are so clever
then why are you on your own tonight?
if you're so terribly good looking
then why do you sleep alone tonight?
because tonight is just like any other night
that's why you're on your own tonight
with your triumphs and your charms
while they are in each other's arms.."
It's so easy to laugh
it's so easy to hate
it takes strength to be gentle and kind
It's so easy to laugh
it's so easy to hate
it takes guts to be gentle and kind
love is Natural and Real
but not for you, my love
not tonight my love
love is Natural and Real
but not for such as you and I, my love
Oh Mother, I can fell the soil falling over my head
Oh Mother, I can fell the soil falling over my head...

 

NEVER HAD NO ONE EVER

When you walk without ease
on these
the very streets where you were raised
I had a really bad dream
it lasted 20 years, 7 months, and 27 days
Never had no one ever.

 

CEMETERY GATES

A dreaded sunny day
so I meet you at the cemetry gates
Keats and Yeats are on your side
A dreaded sunny day
so I meet you at the cemetry gates
Keats and Yeats are on your side
while Wilde is on mine
So we go inside and we gravely read the stones
all those people all those lives
where are they now ?
with loves, and hates
and passions just like mine
they were born
and then they lived and then they died
which seems so unfair
and I wantr to crv
You say: "ere thrice the sun hath done salutation to the dawn"
and you claim these words as your own
but Im well-read, have heard them said
a hundred times (maybe less, maybe more)
if you must write prose/poems
the words you use should be your own
dont plagiarise or take "on loans"
there's alweays someone, somewhere
with a big nose, who knows
and who trips you up and laughs
when you fall
You say: "ere long done do does did "
words which could only be your own
you then produce the text
from whence was ripped
(some dizzy whore, 1804)
A dreaded sunny day
so let's go where we're happy
so I meet you at the cemetry gates
Keats and Yeats are on your side
A dreaded sunny day
so let's go where we're wanted
so I meet you at the cemetry gates
Keats and Yeats are on your side
but you lose
because Wilde is on mine

 

BIGMOUTH STRIKES AGAIN

Sweetness, sweetness I was only joking
when I said Id like to smash every tooth
in your head
Sweetness, sweetness I was only joking
when I said by right s you should be
bludgeoned in your bed
and now I know how Joan of Arc felt
now I know how Joan of Arc felt
as the flames roseto her roman nose
and her Walkman stared to melt
Bibmouth, bigmouth
bigmouth strikes again
and Ive got no right to take my place
with the Human race
and now I know how Joan of Arc felt
now I know of Joan of Arc felt
as the flames rose to her roman nose
and her hearing aid started to melt
Bigmouth, bigmouth
bigmouth strikes again
and Ive got no right to take my place

THE BOY WITH A THORN IN HIS SIDE

The boy with the thorn in his side
behind the hatred there lies
a murderous desire for love
how can they look into my eyes
and still they dont believe me
how can they hear me say those words
and still they dont believe me
and if they don't believe me now
will they ever believe me?
and if they don't believe me now
will they ever believe me?
The boy with the thorn in his side
behind the hatred there lies
a plundering desire for love
how can they see the Love in our eyes
and still they don't believe us
and after all this time
they don't want to believe us
and if they dont believe us now
will they ever believe us ?
andd when you want to Live
how do you start ?
where do you go ?
who do you know?

 

VICAR IN A TUTU

I was minding mind business
lifting some lead off
the roof of the Holy Name church
it was worthwhile living a laughable life
just to set my eyes on a blistering sight
of a vicar in a tu-tu
he's not strange
he just wants to live his life this way
a scanty bit of a thing
with a decorative ring
that wouldn't cover the head of a child
as Rose collects the money in the cannister
who comes sliding down the bannister
the vicar in a tu-tu
he's not strange
he just wants to live his life this way
the monkish monsignor
with a head full of plaster
said "my man, get your vile soul dry-cleaned"
as Rose counts the money in the cannister
as natural as rain
he dances again
vicar in a tu-tu
The next day in the pulpit
with Freedom and Ease
combating ignoranca,dust and disease
as Rose counts the money in the cannister
as natural as rain
he dances again
the fabric of a tu-tu
any man could get us to
and I am a living sign.

 

THERE IS A LIGHT THAT NEVER GOES OUT

Take me out tonight
where there's music and there's people
who are young and alive
driving in your car
I never never want to go home
because I havent got one
anymore
take me out tonight
because I want to see people and I
want to see lights
driving in your car
oh please dont drop me home
because it's not my home, it's their
home, and Im welcome no morw
and if a double-decker bus
crashes in to us
to die by your side
such a heavenly way to die
and if a ten ton truck
kills the both of us
to die by your side
the pleasure and the privilege is mine
take me out tonight
oh take me anywhere, I dont care
and in the darken underpass
I thought Oh God, my chance has come at last
(but then a strange fear gripped me and I just couldn't ask)
take me out tonight
take me anywhere, I dont care
just driving in your car
I never never want to go home
because I havent got one
I havent got one.

 

SOME GIRLS ARE BIGGER THAN OTHERS

From the ice-age to the dole-age
there is but one concern
and I have just discover
some girls are bigger than others
some girls are bigger than others
some girls mothers are bigger than
other girls mothers
As Anthony said to Cleopatra
as he opened a crate of ale:
some girls are bigger than others
some girls are bigger than others
some girls mothers are bigger than
other girls mothers.

 

A RUSH AND A PUSH AND AND THE LAND IS OURS

HELLO
I am the ghost of Troubled Joe
hung by his pretty white neck
some eighteen months ago
I travelled to a mystical time zone
but I missed my bed
so I soon came home
they said:
"there's too much caffeine
in your bloodstream
and a lack of real spice
in your life"
I said:
"leave me alone
because I'm alright, dad
just surprised to still
be on my own...."
Ooh, but don't mention love
I'd hate the real strain of the pain again
a rush and a push and the land that
we stand on is ours
it has been before
so it shall be again
and people who are uglier than you and I
they take what they need, and leave
Ooh, but don't mention love
I'd hate the pain and the strain all over again
a rush and a push and the land that
we stand on is ours
it has been before
so why can't it be now?
and people who are weaker than you and I
they take what they want from life
Ooh, but don't mention love
no - just don't mention love!
a rush and a push and the land that
we stand on is ours
your youth may be gone
but you're still a young man
so phone me, phone me, phone me
so phone me, phone me, phone me
Ooh, I think I'm in love...
Urrgh, I think I'm in lerv

 

I STARTED SOMETHING I COULDN'T FINISH

The lanes were silent
with nothing or no one around for miles
I doused our friendly venture
with a hard-faced
three-word gesture
I started something
I forced you into a zone
and you were clearly
never meant to go
hair brushed and parted
typical me, typical me, typical me
I started something
...and now I'm not too sure
I grabbed you by the guilded beams
that's what Tradition means
and I doused another venture
with a gesture
that was...absolutely vile
I started something
forced you to a zone
and you were clearly
never meant to go
hair brushed and parted
typical me, typical me, typical me
I started something
...and now I'm not too sure
I grabbed you by the guilded beams
that's what Tradition means
and now eighteen months' hard-labour
seems...fair enough
I started something
forced you to a zone
and you were clearly
never meant to go
hair brushed and parted
typical me, typical me, typical me
I started something
and now I'm not too sure

 

DEATH OF A DISCO DANCER

The death of a disco dancer
well, it happens a lot 'round here
and if you think Peace
is a common goal
well, that goes to show
just how little you know
The death of a disco dancer
well, I'd rather not get involved
I never talk to my neighbour
I'd just rather not get involved
Love, peace and harmony?
Love, peace and harmony?
Oh, very nice, very nice, very nice, very nice
...but maybe in the next world.

 

GIRLFRIEND IN A COMA

Girlfriend in a coma, I know
I know - it's serious
Girlfriend in a coma, I know
I know - it's really serious
there wree times when I could
have 'murdered' her
(but, you know, I would hate
anything to happen to her)
NO, I DON'T WANT TO SEE HER
Do you really think
she'll pull through?
Do you really think
she'll pull through?
Girlfriend in a coma, I know
I know, it's serious
there were time when I could
have 'strangeled' her
(but, you know, I would hate
anything to happen to her)
WOULD YOU PLEASE LET ME SEE HER!
Do you really think she'll pull through?
Do you really think she'll pull through?
Let me wisper my last goodbyes
I know - IT'S SERIOUS

 

STOP ME IF YOU'VE HEARD THIS ONE BEFORE

Stop me, stop me,
stop me if you think that you've heard this one before
stop me, stop me
stop me if you think that you've heard this one before
nothing's changed
I still love you, oh I still love you
...only slightly less than I used to
I was delayed, I was way-laid
an emergency stop
I smelt the last ten seconds of life
I crashed down on the crossbar
and the pain was enough to make
a shy, bald buddhist reflect
and plan a mass-murder
who said I'd lied to her?
who said I'd lied because I never
who said I'd lied because I never
I was detained, I was restrained
he broke my spleen
he broke my knees
(and then he really laid into me)
Friday night in Out-patients
who said I'd lied to her?
who said I'd lied - because I never
who said I'd lied - because I never
Oh, so I drank one
or was it four
and when I fell on the floor
...I drank more
stop me, stop me
stop me if you think that you've heard this one before
nothing's changed
I still love you, I still love you
but only slightly
less than I used to

 

LAST NIGHT I DREAMT THAT SOMEBODY LOVED ME

Last night I dreamt
that somebody loved me
no hope - but no harm
just another false alarm
Las night I felt
real arms around me
no hope - no harm
just another false alarm
so, tell me how long
before the last one?
and tell me how long
before the right one?
this story is old - I KNOW
but it goes on
this story is old - I KNOW
but it goes on

 

UNHAPPY BIRTHDAY

I've come to wish you an unhappy birthday
I've come to wish you an unhappy birthday
because you're evil
and you lie
and if you should die
I may feel slightly sad
(but I won't cry)
Loved and lost
and some may say
when usually its Nothing
surely you're happy
it should be this way?
I say "No, I'm gonna kill my dog"
and: "May the lines sag heavy
and deep tonight XXX"
I've come to wish you an unhappy birthday

so, drink, drink, drink
and be ill tonight
from the one you left behind

PAINT A VULGAR PICTURE

At the record company meeting
On their hands - a dead star
and ooh, the plans that they weave
and ooh, the sikening greed
At the record company meeting
on their hands - a dead star
the sycophantic slags all say:
"I knew him first, and I knew him well"
Re-issue! Re-package! Re-package!
Re-evaluate the songs
double-pack with a photograph
Extra Track (and a tacky badge)
A-list, playlist
"Please them, please them!"
"Please them! Please them!"
(sadly, THIS was your life)
but you could have said no
if you'd wanted to
you could have said no
if you'd wanted to
BPI, MTV, BBC
"Please them! Please them!"
(sadly this was your life)
but you could have said no
if you'd wanted to
you could have walked away
...couldn't you?
I touched you at the soundcheck
you had no real way of knowing
in my heart I bgged "please, take
me with you...
I don't care where you're going"
But to you I was faceless
I was fawning, I was boring
just a child from those ugly new houses
who could never begin to know
who could never really know
Best of? Most of?
Satiate the need
slip them into different sleeves!
Buy both, and be decieved
climber - new entry, re-entry
World tour! ("media whore")
"Please the Press in Belgium!"
(THIS was your life...)
and when it fails to recoup?
Well, maybe:
You just haven't earned it yet, baby
I walked a pace behind you at the soundcheck
you're just the same as I am
what makes most people feel happy
leads us headlong into harm
so, in my bedroom in those 'ugly new houses'
I dance my legs down to the knees
but me and my 'true love'
we will never meet again...
At the record company meeting
on their hands - at last! - a dead star!
but they cannot taint you in my eyes
no, they cannout touch you now
No, they cannot hurt you my darling
they cannot touch you now
but me and my 'true love'
will never meet again

 

DEATH AT ONE'S ELBOW

Ooh Glenn, don't come to the house tonight
Ooh, Glenn, don't come to the house tonight
because there's somebody here
who really really loves you
stay home
be bored
(it's crap, I KNOW)
Ooh, Glenn, don't come to the house tonight
Ooh, Glen, don't come to the house tonight
because there's somebody here
who'll take a hatchet to your ear
how the frustration renders me
hateful, Glenn!
don't come to the house tonight
don't come to the house tonight
because you'll slip on the
trail of my bespattered remains
and so, that's why
GOODBYE MY LOVE, GOODBYE MY LOVE, GOODBYE MY LOVE...
Belch

 

I WON'T SHARE YOU

I won't share you
I won't share you
with the drive and ambition
and the zeal I feel
this is my time
as the note I wrote
was read, she said
has the Perrier gone
straight to my head
or is life plainly sick and cruel, instead?
"YES!"
No-no-no-no-no-no
I won't share you
I won't share you
with the drive and the dreams inside
this is my time
Life tends to come and go
well, that's OK
just as long as you know
Life tends to come and go
well, that's OK
just as long as you know
I won't share you
I won't share you

this is my time, this is my time


THE QUEEN IS DEAD

Farewell to this lands cheerless marches
hemmed in like a boar between arches
her very Lowness with her head in a sling
Im truely sorry-but it sounds like a wonderful thing
dear Charles, dont you ever crave
to appear on the front of the Daily mail
dressed in your Mother's bridal veil?
So, I checked all the registered historical facts
and I was shocked into shame to discover
how Im the 18th pale descendent
of some, old queen or other
has the world changed, or have I changed?
has the world changed, or have I changed?
as some 9-year old tough peddles drugs
(I never even knew what drugs were)
And so, I broke into the Palace
with a sponge and a rusty spanner
she said: "Eh, I know you, and you cannot sing"
I said: "that's nothing -you should hear me play piano"
We can go for a walk where it's quiet and dry
and we can talk about precious things
but when you are tied to your mother's apron
not one talks about castration
We can go for a walk where it's quiet and dry
and we can talk about precious things
like love and law and poverty
these are the things that kill me
We can go for a walk where it's quiet and dry
and we can talk about precious things
but the rain that flattens my hair
theses are the things that kill me
Passed the Pub that saps your body
and the church who'll snatch your money
the Queen is dead, boys
and it's so lonely on a limb
Pass the Pub that wrecks your body
and the church-all they want is your money
the Queen is dead, boys`
you can trust me, boys
life is very long, when you're lonely
life is very long, when you're lonely...

 

PANIC

Panic on the streets of London
Panic on the streets of Birmingham
I wonder to myself
Could life ever be sane again
on the Leeds side-streets that you slip down
I wonder to myself
Hopes may rise on the Grasmeres
But Honey Pie, you're not safe here
So you run down
To the safety of the town
But there's Panic on the streets of Carlisle
Dublin, Dundee, Humberside
I wonder to myself
Burn down the Disco
Hang the blessed D.J.
Because the music that they constantly play
IT SAYS NOTHING TO ME ABOUT MY LIFE
Hang the blessed D.J.
Because the music they constantly play
On the Leeds side-streets that you slip down
On the provincial towns that you jog 'round
Hang the D.J.,. Hang the D.J.,.Hang the D.J...

 

VICAR IN A TUTU

I was minding mind business
lifting some lead off
the roof of the Holy Name church
it was worthwhile living a laughable life
just to set my eyes on a blistering sight
of a vicar in a tu-tu
he's not strange
he just wants to live his life this way
a scanty bit of a thing
with a decorative ring
that wouldn't cover the head of a child
as Rose collects the money in the cannister
who comes sliding down the bannister
the vicar in a tu-tu
he's not strange
he just wants to live his life this way
the monkish monsignor
with a head full of plaster
said "my man, get your vile soul dry-cleaned"
as Rose counts the money in the cannister
as natural as rain
he dances again
vicar in a tu-tu
The next day in the pulpit
with Freedom and Ease
combating ignoranca,dust and disease
as Rose counts the money in the cannister
as natural as rain
he dances again
the fabric of a tu-tu
any man could get us to
and I am a living sign.

 

ASK

Shyness is nice, but
Shyness can stop you
From doing all the things in life
That you'd like to
So, if there's something you'd like to try
ASK ME-I WON'T SAY "NO"-HOW COULD I?
Coyness is nice, but ,
Coyness can stop you
from saying all the things in
life that you want to
If there's something that you'd like to try
ASK ME-I WON'TSAY"NO"-HOW COULD I?
Spending warm, Summer days indoors
Writing fringhtening verse
To a buck-toothed girl in Luxembourg
ASK ME, ASK ME ,ASK ME, ASK ME, ASK ME ,ASK ME
Because if it's not Love
Then it's the Bomb
That will bring us together
Nature is a language-can't you read?
Nature is a language-can't you read?
ASK ME, ASK ME ,ASK ME, ASK ME, ASK ME ,ASK ME
Because if it's not Love
Then it's the Bomb
That will bring us together

 

MARIE'S THE NAME (HIS LATEST FLAME) / RUSHOLME RUFFIANS

Very old friend 
Came by today 
As he was telling everyone in town 
Of all the love that he'd just found 
And Marie's the name (of his latest flame) 
Talked and talked 
And I heard him say 
That she had the longest blackest hair 
Prettiest green eyes anywhere 
And Marie's the name (of his latest flame) 
The last night of the fair 
By the big wheel generator 
A boy is stabbed 
His money is grabbed 
And the air hangs heavy like a dulling wine 
She is Famous 
She is Funny 
An engagement ring 
Doesn't mean a thing 
To a mind consumed by brass (money), oh 
The last night of the fair 
From a seat on a whirling waltzer 
Her skirt ascends for a watching eye 
It's a hideous trait (on her mother's side)
From a seat on a whirling waltzer 
Her skirt ascends for a watching eye 
A hideous trait (on her mother's side) 
Then someone falls in love 
Someone's beaten up 
Someone's beaten up 
And the senses being dulled are mine 
And someone falls in love 
Someone's beaten up 
And the senses being dulled are mine 
This is the last night of the fair 
And the grease in the hair 
Of a speedway operator 
Is all a tremulous heart requires 
A schoolgirl is denied 
She said : "How quickly would I die 
If I jumped from the top of the parachutes ?"
This is the last night of the fair 
And the grease in the hair 
Of a speedway operator 
Is all a tremulous heart requires 
A schoolgirl is denied 
She said : "How quickly would I die 
Oh, if I jumped from the top of the parachutes ?"
...Oh, walk home alone 
I might walk home alone 
But my faith in love is still devout

 

THE BOY WITH THE THORN IN HIS SIDE

The boy with the thorn in his side
behind the hatred there lies
a murderous desire for love
how can they look into my eyes
and still they dont believe me
how can they hear me say those words
and still they dont believe me
and if they don't believe me now
will they ever believe me?
and if they don't believe me now
will they ever believe me?
The boy with the thorn in his side
behind the hatred there lies
a plundering desire for love
how can they see the Love in our eyes
and still they don't believe us
and after all this time
they don't want to believe us
and if they dont believe us now
will they ever believe us ?
andd when you want to Live
how do you start ?
where do you go ?
who do you know?

 

RUBBER RING / WHAT SHE SAID

Yeah! What she says : 
"How come someone hasn't noticed 
That I'm dead 
And decided to bury me ? 
God knows, I'm ready !"
La-la-la ... 
What she said was sad 
But then, all the rejection she's had 
To pretend to be happy 
Could only be idiocy 
La-la-la ... 
What she said was not for the job or 
Lover that she never had 
No no no ... 
What she read 
All heady books 
She'd sit and prophesise 
(It took a tattooed boy from 
Birkenhead 
To really really open her eyes)

No no no no ...

 

IS IT REALLY SO STRANGE?

I left the North 
I travelled South 
I found a tiny house 
And I can't help the way I feel 
Oh yes, you can kick me 
And you can punch me 
And you can break my face 
But you won't change the way I feel 
'Cause I love you, Oh ... 
And is it really so strange ? 
Oh, is it really so strange ? 
Oh, is it really so, really so strange ? 
I say NO, you say YES 
(and you will change your mind) 
I left the South 
I travelled North 
I got confused - I killed a horse 
I can't help the way I feel 
Oh yes, you can punch me 
And you can butt me 
And you can break my spine 
But you won't change the way I feel 
'Cause I love you, Oh ... 
And is it really so strange ? 
Oh, is it really so strange ? 
Oh, is it really so, really so strange ? 
I say NO, you say YES 
(But you will change your mind) 
I left the North again 
I travelled South again 
And I got confused - I killed a nun 
I CAN'T HELP THE WAY I FEEL 
(I lost my bag in Newport Pagnell) 
Why is the last mile the hardest mile ? 
My throat was dry, with the sun in my eyes 
And I realised, I realised 
I could never 
I could never, never, never, go back home again

 

CEMETERY GATES

A dreaded sunny day
so I meet you at the cemetry gates
Keats and Yeats are on your side
A dreaded sunny day
so I meet you at the cemetry gates
Keats and Yeats are on your side
while Wilde is on mine
So we go inside and we gravely read the stones
all those people all those lives
where are they now ?
with loves, and hates
and passions just like mine
they were born
and then they lived and then they died
which seems so unfair
and I wantr to crv
You say: "ere thrice the sun hath done salutation to the dawn"
and you claim these words as your own
but Im well-read, have heard them said
a hundred times (maybe less, maybe more)
if you must write prose/poems
the words you use should be your own
dont plagiarise or take "on loans"
there's alweays someone, somewhere
with a big nose, who knows
and who trips you up and laughs
when you fall
You say: "ere long done do does did "
words which could only be your own
you then produce the text
from whence was ripped
(some dizzy whore, 1804)
A dreaded sunny day
so let's go where we're happy
so I meet you at the cemetry gates
Keats and Yeats are on your side
A dreaded sunny day
so let's go where we're wanted
so I meet you at the cemetry gates
Keats and Yeats are on your side
but you lose
because Wilde is on mine

 

LONDON

Smoke
Lingers 'round your fingers
Train
Heave on - to Euston
Do you think you've made
The right decision this time?
You left
Your tired family grieving
And you think they're sad because you're leaving
But didn't you see the Jealousy in the eyes
Of the ones who had to stay behind?
And do you think you've made
The right decision thins time?
You left
Your girlfriend on the platform
With thei really ragged notion that you'll return
But she knows
That when he goes
He really goes
So do you think you've made
The right decision this time?

 

I KNOW IT'S OVER

I can feel the soil falling over my head 
And as I climb into an empty bed 
Oh well. Enough said. 
I know it's over - still I cling 
I don't know where else I can go 
Over ... 
Oh Mother, I can feel the soil falling over my head 
See, the sea wants to take me 
The knife wants to cut me 
Do you think you can help me ? 
Sad veiled bride, please be happy 
Handsome groom, give her room 
Loud, loutish lover, treat her kindly 
(Though she needs you 
More than she loves you) 
And I know it's over - still I cling 
I don't know where else I can go 
Over, it's over, it's over, it's over 
It's over, la ... 
I know it's over 
And it never really began 
But in my heart it was so real
And you even spoke to me, and said : 
"If you're so funny 
Then why are you on your own tonight ? 
And if you're so clever 
Then why are you on your own tonight ? 
I know ... 
'Cause tonight - it's just like any other night 
That's why you're on your own tonight 
Your triumphs and your charms 
While they're in each other's arms..."
It's so easy to laugh 
It's so easy to hate 
It takes strength to be gentle and kind 
Over, over, over, over 
It's so easy to laugh 
It's so easy to hate 
It takes guts to be gentle and kind 
Over, over 
Love is Natural and Real 
But not for you, my love 
Not tonight, my love 
Love is Natural and Real 
But not for such as you and I, my love 
Oh Mother, I can feel the soil falling over my head...
Oh Mother, I can feel the soil fall over, fall over my head 
Oh Mother, I can feel the ... fall over my ... , Oh ...

 

THE DRAIZE TRAIN

A vastly superior version of the instrumental B-side, acting as a peace 
offering to Marr (Morrissey chose the tracks for the compilation, 
and of course, receives no royalties on this track).

 

STILL ILL

I decree today that life
is simply taking and not giving
England is mine and it owes me a living
ask me why, and I'll spit in your eye
ask me why, and I'll spit in your eye
but we cannot cling to the old dreams anymore
no, we cannot cling to the old dreams anymore
Does the body rule the mind
or does the mind rule the body?
I dunno...
Under the iron bridge we kissed
and although I ended up with sore lips
it just wasn't like the old days anymore
no, it wasn't like those days
am I still ill?
Does the body rule the mind
or does the mind rule the body ?
I dunno...
Ask me why, and I'll die
ask me why, and I'll die
and if you must go to work tomorrow
well, if I were you I wouldn't bother
for there are brighter sides to life
and I should know because I've seen them
but not very often...
under the iron bridge we kissed
and although I ended up with sore lips
it just wasn't like the old days anymore
no, it wasn't like those days
am I still ill?

 

BIGMOUTH STRIKES AGAIN

Sweetness, sweetness I was only joking
when I said Id like to smash every tooth
in your head
Sweetness, sweetness I was only joking
when I said by right s you should be
bludgeoned in your bed
and now I know how Joan of Arc felt
now I know how Joan of Arc felt
as the flames roseto her roman nose
and her Walkman stared to melt
Bibmouth, bigmouth
bigmouth strikes again
and Ive got no right to take my place
with the Human race
and now I know how Joan of Arc felt
now I know of Joan of Arc felt
as the flames rose to her roman nose
and her hearing aid started to melt
Bigmouth, bigmouth
bigmouth strikes again
and Ive got no right to take my place
with the Human race

 
ALSATIAN COUSTIN

Were you and he Lovers?
and would you say so if you were?
on a forecourt
on a Friday
passing my way
Were you and he Lovers?
and if you were, then say that you were!
on a groundsheet
under canvas
with your tent-flap
open wide
A note upon his desk:
"P.S. Bring Me Home And Have Me!"
Leather elbows on a tweed coat
- Oh! -
Is THAT the best you can do?
So came his reply:
"...but on the desk is where I want you!"
So I ask (even though I know):
were you and he Lovers?

 

LITTLE MAN, WHAT NOW?

An afternoon nostalgia
television show
you spoke in silhouette
(but they couldn't name you)
although the panel were
very polite to you
but I remembered you
from Friday nights 1969
ATV - you murdered every line
too old to be a child star
too young to take leads
four seasons passed
and they AXED you
nervously juvenile
(WON'T SMILE!)
What became of you?
did that swift eclipse torture you?
a star at eighteen
and then-suddenly gone
down to a few lines
in the back page of a teenage annual
oh but I remembered you
I looked up to you

 

EVERYDAY IS LIKE SUNDAY

Trudging slowly over wet sand
back to the bench
where your clothes were stolen
this is the coastal town
that they forgot to close down
Armageddon - come Armageddon!
Come Armageddon! Come!
Everyday is like Sunday
everyday is silent and grey
Hide on the promenade
scratch out a postcard
"how I dearly with I was not here"
in the seaside town
...that they forgot to bomb
Come! Come! Come - nuclear bomb!
Everyday is like Sunday
everyday is silent and grey
Trudging back over pebbles and sand
and a strange dust lands on your hands
(and on your face)
Everyday is like Sunday
"Win Yourself A Cheap Tray"
share some greased tea with me
everyday is silent and grey

 

BENGALI IN PLATFORMS

No no no
he does not want to depress you
oh no no no no no
he only wants to impress you
Bengali in platform
she only wants to embrace your culture
and to be your friend forever
Bengali, Bengali
oh shelve your Western plans
and understand that life is hard enough when you belong here
A silver-studded rim that glistens
and an ankle-star that...blinds me
a lemon sole so very high
which only reminds me, to tell you
so I break the news gently
I break the news to you gently
"Shelve your plans"
Bengali, Bengali
its the touchy march of time
that blinds you
don't blame me
don't hate me
just because I'm the one to tell you
that life is hard enough when you belong here
life is hard enough when you belong here
shelve your western plans
life is hard enough when you belong here

 

ANGEL, ANGEL, DOWN WE GO TOGETHER

Angel, Angel
don't take your life tonight
I know they take
and that they take in turn
and they give you nothing real
for yourself in return
and when they've used you
and they've broken you
and wasted all your money
and cast your shell aside
and when they've bought you
and they've sold you
and they've billed you for the pleasure
and they've made your parents cry
I will be here
BELIEVE ME
I will be here
...believe me
Angel, don't take your life
some people have got no pride
they do not understand
the Urgency of life
but I love you more than life
I love you more than life
I love you more than life
I love you more than life

 

LALE NIGHT, MAUDLIN STREET

The last night on Maudlin Street
goodbye house
goodbye stairs
I was born here
I was raised here, and
...I took some stick here
love at first sight
may sound trite
but it's true, you know
I could list the details
of everything you ever wore
or said, or how you stood that day
and as we spend the last night
on Maudlin Street, I say
"goodbye house-forever!"
I never stole a happy hour
around here
Where the world's ugliest boy
became what you see
here I am - the ugliest man
Its the last night on Maudlin Street
and truly I do love you
oh, truly I do love you
When I sleep with that picture of
you framed beside my bed
oh, it's childish and it's silly
but I think it's you in my room
by the bed (...yes, I told you it was silly...)
and I know
I took strange pills
but I never meant to hurt you
oh truly I love you
I came home late one night
everyone had gone to bed
nobody stays up for you
when you have sixteen stitches
all around your head
the last buss I missed to Maudlin Street
so, he drove me home in the Van
complaining: "Women only like me for my mind..."
don't leave your torch behind
power-cuts ahead
as we crept through the park
but no I cannot steal a pair of jeans
off a clothesline for you
but you...without clothes
oh I could not keep a straight face
me - without clothes?
well a nation turns its back and gags...
I'm packed
I am moving house
a half-life disappears today
every slag waves me on
(secretly wishing me gone
well, I will be soon
oh - I will be soon)
There were bad times on Maudlin Street
when they took you away in a police car
dear Inspector - don't you know?
don't you care?
don't you know - about Love?
Your gran died
and your mother died
on Maudlin Street
in pain and ashamed
with never time to say
those special things
I took the keys from Maudlin Street
well, it's only bricks and mortar!
and...truly I do love you
wherever you are
wherever you are

 

SUEDHEAD

Why do you come here
why do you hang around
I'm so sorry
I'm so sorry
Why do you come here
when you know it makes
things hard for me
when you know, oh
why do you come?
Why do you telephone?
and why send me silly notes?
I'm so sorry
I'm so sorry
why do you come here
when you know it makes
thing hard for me
when you know, oh
why do you come?
You had to sneak into my room
'just' to read my diary
was it just to see all the things
you knew I'd written about you?
and...so many illustrations
I'm so very sickened
oh, I am so sickened NOW

 

BREAK UP THE FAMILY

The strange logic of your clumsiest line
stayed emblazoned on my mind
break up the family
and lets begin to live our lives
I went to see all my friends tonight
it wasn't Youth, it wasn't even Life
born Old, sadly wise
resigned (well, we were)
to ending our lives
I'm so glad to grow older
to move away from those awful times
I want to see all my friends tonight
Yes you found love but you weren't
at peace with your life
home late, full of Hate
despise the ties that bind
oh I'm so glad to grow older
to move away from those younger years
now I'm in love for the first time
and I don't feel bad
Let me see all my old friends
let me put my arm around them
because I really do love them
now, does that sound mad?
Captain of games, solid framed
I stood on the touchline
hailstones, driven home
in his car - no breaks? I don't mind
I'm just so glad to grow older
to move away from those darker years
I'm in love for the first time
and I don't feel bad
so wish me luck my friends
goodbye

 

HAIRDRESSER ON FIRE

Here is London
here is London
is it home of the free,
or what?
can you squeeze me
into an empty page of your diary
and psychologically save me
I've got faith in you
I sense the power
in the fingers
within an hour the power
can totally destroy me
or it could same my life
here is London
'home of the brash, outrageous
and free'
you are repressed
but you're remarkably dressed
is it Real?
but you're far to busy
busy scissors
busy clippers
hair dresser on fire
all around Sloane Square
and you're far too busy
to see me
"busy,busy"
hairdresser on fire
was a client over-cautious
he made you nervous
and when he said
"I'm gonna sue you"
I really felt for you
so can you squeeze me
into an empty page of your diary
and supernaturally change me
CHANGE ME, CHANGE ME

 

THE ORDINARY BOYS

Ordinary boys, happy knowing nothing
happy being no one, but themselves
Ordinary girls, supermarket clothes
who think it's very clever to be cruel to you
for you were so different
you stood all alone
and you knew
that it had to be so
avoiding ordinary boys
happy going nowhere, just around here
in their rattling cars
and ordinary girls
never seeing further
than the cold, small streets
that trap them
but you were so different
you had to say no
when those empty fools
tried to change you, and claim you
for the lair of their ordinary world
where they feel so lucky
so lucky, so lucky
with their lives laid out before them
they're so lucky, so lucky
so lucky, so lucky

 

I DON'T MIND IF YOU FORGET ME

I don't mind
I don't mind if you forget me
having learned my lesson
I never left an impression on anyone
so now you send me your hardened 'regards'
when once you'd send me 'love'
sincerely I must tell you
your mild 'best wishes'
they make me suspicious
but I don't mind
I don't mind if you forget me
having learned my lesson
I never left
an impression on anyone
the pressure to change, to move on
was strange
and very strong
so this is why I tell you
I really do understand
BYE BYE
I don't mind if you forget me
no no no no no no no
REJECTION IS ONE THING
BUT REJECTION FROM A FOOL
IS CRUEL
REJECTION IS ONE THING
BUT REJECTION FROM A FOOL
IS CRUEL
and I don't mind if you forget me
I don't mind if your forget me

 

DIAL-A-CLICHE

Further into the fog I fall
well, I was just
following you!
when you said:
"Do as I do and scrap your fey ways"
(dial-a-cliche)
"grow up, be a man, and close your mealy-mouth!"
(dial-a-cliche)
But the person underneath
where does he go?
does he slide by the wayside?
or...does he just die?
when you find that you've organized
your feelings, for people
who didn't like you then
and certainly don't like you now
yet still you say:
"Do as I do and scrap your fey ways"
(dial-a-cliche)
"grow up, be a man, and close your mealy-mouth!"
(dial-a-cliche)
"the Safe way is the only way!
there's always time to change, son!"
yes well I've changed
but I'm in pain!
dial-a-chiche

 

MARGARET ON THE GUILLOTINE

The kind people
have a wonderful dream
Margaret on the guillotine
because people like you
make me feel so tired
when will you die?
when will you die?
when will you die?
when will you die?
when will you die?
because people like you
make me feel so old inside
please die
and kind people
do not shelter this dream
make it real
make the dream real
make the dream real
make it real

 

OUR FRANK

Our frank and open
deep conversations
they get me nowhere
they bring me down, so
give it a rest, won't you?
give me a cigarette
God give me patience
just no more conversation
Give us a drink
and make it quick
or else I'm gonna be sick
sick all over
your frankly vulgar
red pullover
now see how the colours blend
Our frank and open
deep conversations
they get me nowhere
they bring me down, so
give it a rest, won't you?
now will you just give over
the world may be ending
but look, I'm only human
Give us a drink
and make it quick
or else I'm gonna be sick
all over
your frankly vulgar
red pullover
now see how the two colours blend
Won't somebody stop me
from thinking all the time
about everything
so deeply
so bleakly

 

ASIAN RUT

Day oh so late
strangely the sun still shone
oh Asian boy
what are you on?
Day oh so late
strangely the sun still shone
what drugs are you on?
Tooled-up Asian boy
has come here to avenge
the cruel, cold killing
of his very best friend
Tooled-up Asian boy
has come here to take revenge
for the cruel, cold killing
of his only friend
Peace through the school
so quiet in the hall
it's a strange sign for one
of what's to come
Tough and hard and pale
oh they may just impale you on railings
oh English boys
it must be wrong
three against one?
Brakes slammed, and
a gun jammed, and
as far as I could tell
brave Asian boy
dealt a blow and fell
I'm just passing through here
on my way to somewhere civilised
and maybe I'll even arrive
maybe I'll even arrive?

 

SING YOUR LIFE

Sing your life
any fool can think of words that rhyme
many others do
why don't you?
do you want to?
Sing your life
just walk right up to the microphone
and name
all the things that you love
all the things that you loathe
sing your life
all the things that you love
all the things that you loathe
oh sing your life
oh sing your life
Others sang your life
but now's your chance to shine
and have the pleasure of
saying what you mean
the rare pleasure of
meaning what you sing
oh, make no mistake, my friend
all of this will end
so sing it now
all the things you love
all the things you loathe
oh sing your life
all the things that you love
all the things that you loathe
oh sing your, oh sing your
Don't leave it all unsaid
somewhere in the wasteland of your head
and make no mistake, my friend
your pointless life will end
but before you go
can you look at the truth?
You have a lovely singing voice
a lovely singing voice
and all of those
who sing on key
they stole the notion
from you and me

 

MUTE WITNESS

Your poor witness
crying so loudly on the floor
oh but she's only trying to tell you
what it was that she saw
she is only trying to tell you
what it was that she saw
Now see her standing on the table
with her small arms flailing
and you feel such compassion
in your soul for
Your poor mute witness
still testing the strength
of our patience
oh but she's only trying to tell you
what it was that she saw
Now see her pointing to the frisbee
with a memory too fuzzy
as her silent words
describe the fright of last night
4 a.m. Norhtside, Clapham Common
who knows what she was doing there?
will she sketch the answer later?
Well, I'll ask her
"now dry your tears, my dear"
Now see her mime in time so nicely
it would all have been so clear
is only she had never volunteered
"your taxi is here, my dear"

 

KING LEER

Your boyfriend, he
went down on one knee
well, could it be
he's only got one knee?
I tried to surprise you
with Vodka
or, Tizer
I can't quite remember
but you didn't thank me
you didn't even thank me
because you never do
Your boyfriend, he
has the gift of the gab
or, could it be
the gift of the grab?
I tried to surprise you
I lay down beside you
and...nothing much happened
and you didn't phone me
you didn't even phone me
because it's not your style
to dial
Your boyfriend, he
displays to me
more than just
a hint of cruelty
I tried to surprise you
I crept up behind you
with a homeless chihuahua
you gushed for an hour
you handed him back and said
"You'll never guess
I'm bored now"

 

FOUND FOUND FOUND

found found found found found found
someone who's worth it
in this murkiness
someone who's never
seeming scheming
found found found found found found
someone who's worth it
in this murkiness
someone who's never
seeming scheming
Oh, but if I'd never found
oh, but if I'd never found
oh, but if I'd never found
I do believe that
the more you give your love
and I do believe that
the more you offer trust
the more you chase
the more you cry
the more you're bound to lose
the more you're bound to lose
Oh, but if I'd never found
oh, but if I'd never found
somebody
who wants to be
who wants to be
with me
all the time

 

DRIVING YOUR GIRLFRIEND HOME

I'm driving
your girlfriend home
and she's saying
how she never chose you
"turn left", she says
so I turn left
and she says
"So how did I end up
so deeply involved in
the very existence
I planned on avoiding?"
and I can't answer
I'm driving
your girlfriend home
and she's laughing
to stop herself crying
"drive on", she says
so I drive on
and she says
"So how did I end up
attached to this person
when his sense of humour
gets gradually worser?"
and I can't tell her
I'm parking
outside her home
and we're shaking hands
goodnight, so politely

 

THE HARSH TRUTH OF THE CAMERA EYE

Churchillian legs
hair barely there
the harsh truth of the camera eye
Your eyes signal pain
because of the strain
of smiling
the harsh truth of the camera eye
telling you all
that you never wnated to know
showing what
you didn't want shown
My so friendly lens
zooms into
"the inner you"
and it tells the harsh truth
and nothing but
Laugh with us all here
that's if you can
then take the pictures home
and screamtelling you all
that you never wanted to know
showing you what
you didn't want shown
This photographer
he must have really had it in for you
"Oh, I don't want
to be judged anymore
I don't wnat to be judged
I would sooner be Loved
I would sooner be
just blindly Loved..."

 

(I'M) THE END OF THE FAMILY LINE

With no complications
fifteen generations
(of mine)
all honouring Nature
until I arrive
(with incredible style)
I'm the end fo the line
the end of the family line
the end of the line
No baby pulled screaming
out into this seething whirl
by chance or whim
(or even love?)
our family tree hacked into decline
and I'm spared the pain
of ever saying
("goodbye")
I'm the end of the line
the end of the family line
the end of the line

 

THERE'S A PLACE IN HELL FOR ME AND MY FRIENDS

There is a place
reserved
for me and my friends
and when we go
we all will go
so you see
I'm never alone
there is a place
with a bit more time
and a few more
gentler words
and looking back
we do forgive
(we had no choice
we always did)
all that we hope
is that when we go
our skin
and our blood
and our bones
don't get in your way
making you ill
the way they did
when we lived
There is a place
a place in hell
reserved
for me and my friends
and if ever I
wanted to cry
then I will
because I can

 

TONY THE PONY

Still drinking on the corner 
Just don't say I didn't warn you 
Always nagging big brother 
He's only looking out for you 
Tony The Pony 
Tony The Pony 
You're still standing on the corner 
Just don't say I didn't warn you 
Old and jealous big brother 
You had your time and you spent it 
Crying 
Now, Tony The Pony 
Tony The Pony 
So, that's what they call you now ? 
When you're free outside 
So cold and hard and in control 
And ... 
There's a free ride on 
Tony The Pony 
Oh, why do you always wanna stop me 
From doing the things in life that make me happy ? 
And when I'm outside with friends, laughing loudly 
Why do you always wanna stop me ? 
Oh, I would never 
I would never 
But you will carry the can for anyone 
The free ride on 
Gullible Tony 
You're drunker quicker 
And you're sicker even quicker 
For something heavy is gonna fall on you 
Oh ... 
And what do they call you now ? 
When you're free outside 
So cold and hard and in control 
And, oh ... been a lark 
There's a free ride on 
Fucked-up Tony 
I will never say I told you so 
Or how I knew that something bad 
Would happen to you 
I don't wanna say I told you so 
Oh, but Tony, I told you so !!! 
I told you so

 

YOU'RE GONNA NEED SOMEONE ON YOUR SIDE

With the world's fate 
Resting on your shoulder 
You're gonna need 
Someone on your side 
You can't do it by yourself 
Any longer 
You're gonna need 
Someone on your side 
Someone kindly told me 
That you'd wasted 
Eight of nine lives
Oh, give yourself a break 
Before you break down 
You're gonna need someone on your side 
And here I am, And here I am 
Well, you don't need 
To look so pleased ! 
Day or night, 
There is no difference 
You're gonna need someone on your side 
Day or night, 
There is no difference 
You're gonna need someone soon 
And here I am, And here I am 
Well, you don't need 
To look so pleased

 

GLAMOROUS GLUE

First day with the jar 
You find 
Everyone lies 
First day with the jar 
You find 
Everyone lies, nobody minds 
Everyone lies 
Where is the man you respect ? 
And where is the woman you love ? 
Where's the woman you love ? 
Third week with the jar
You find 
Everything dies 
We won't vote Conservative 
Because we never have 
Everyone lies, everyone lies 
Where is the man you respect ? 
And where is the woman you love ? 
Where's the woman you love ? 
Everything of worth 
On Earth Is there To share 
I used to dream, and I used to vow 
I wouldn't dream of it now 
We look to Los Angeles 
For the language we use 
London is dead, London is dead, London is dead...
Now I'm too much in love 
I'm too much in love 
I know 
I'll go 
Empty hand 
From the land

 

WE'LL LET YOU KNOW

How sad are we ? 
And how sad have we been ? 
We'll let you know 
We'll let you know 
Oh, but only if - you're really interested 
You wonder how 
We've stayed alive 'till now 
We'll let you know 
We'll let you know 
But only if - you're really interested 
We're all smiles 
Then, honest, I swear, it's the turnstiles 
That make us hostile 
Oh ... 
We will descend 
On anyone unable to defend 
Themselves 
Oh ... 
And the songs we sing 
They're not supposed to mean a thing 
La, la, la, la ... 
Oh ...You're lonely, Oh ... you're lonely, Oh ... 
GET OFF THE ROOF ! Oh ... 
Your Arsenal !
We may seem cold, or 
We may even be 
The most depressing people you've ever known 
At heart, what's left, we sadly know 
That we are the last truly British people you'll ever know 
We are the last truly British people you will ever know 
You'll never never want to know

 

THE NATIONAL FRONT DISCO

David, the wind blows 
The wind blows ... 
Bits of your life away 
Your friends all say ... 
"Where is our boy ? Oh, we've lost our boy" 
But they should know 
Where you've gone 
Because again and again you've explained that 
You're going to ... 
Oh, you're going to ... 
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah 
England for the English ! 
England for the English ! 
David, the winds blow 
The winds blow ...
All of my dreams away 
And I still say : 
"Where is our boy ? Ah, we've lost our boy" 
But I should know 
Why you've gone 
Because again and again you've explained
You've gone to the ... 
National, ah ... 
To the National .. 
There's a country; you don't live there 
But one day you would like to 
And if you show them what you're made of 
Oh, then you might do ... 
But David, we wonder 
We wonder if the thunder 
Is ever really gonna begin 
Begin, begin 
Your mom says : 
"I've lost my boy" 
But she should know 
Why you've gone 
Because again and again you've explained 
You've gone to the : 
National 
To the National 
To the National Front Disco 
Because you want the day to come sooner 
You want the day to come sooner 
You want the day to come sooner 
When you've settled the score 
Oh, the National 
Oh, the National

 

CERTAIN PEOPLE I KNOW

I take the cue from 
Certain people I know 
I use the cue 
And then I 
Hand it on to you 
And when I swing it 
So, it catches his eye ... 
(Weren't you there ? 
- You'd have died !) 
I trust the views of 
Certain people I know 
They look at Danger 
And they 
LAUGH THEIR HEADS OFF 
Their clothes are Imitation 
George the 23rd 
(Don't you find this absurd ?) 
I'd hate to be like 
Certain people I know 
They break their necks 
And can't afford to
Get them fixed 
Ah, they'd sacrifice all 
Of their principles for 
anything cashable 
I do believe it's terrible 
Oh, wo, wo, Ah, ah, ah, ah, Oh, wo, wo...

 

WE HATE IT WHEN OUR FRIENDS BECOME SUCCESSFUL

We hate it when our friends become successful 
We hate it when our friends become successful 
Oh, look at those clothes 
Now look at that face, it's so old 
And such a video ! 
Well, it's really laughable 
Ha, ha, ha ...
We hate it when our friends become successful 
And if they're Northern, that makes it even worse
And if we can destroy them 
You bet your life we will 
Destroy them 
If we can hurt them 
Well, we may as well ... 
It's really laughable 
Ha, ha, ha ... 
You see, it should've been me 
It could've been me 
Everybody knows 
Everybody says so 
They say : 
"Ah, you have loads of songs 
So many songs 
More songs than they'd stand 
Verse 
Chorus 
Middle eight 
Break, fade 
Just listen ..."
La, la-la, la-la

 

YOU'RE THE ONE FOR ME, FATTY

You're the One for me, fatty 
You're the One I really, really love 
And I will stay 
Promise you'll say 
If I'm in your way
You're the One for me, fatty 
You're the One I really, really love 
And I will stay 
Promise you'll say 
If I'm ever in your ...
A-hey 
All over Battersea 
Some hope; and some despair 
All over Battersea 
Some hope; and some despair 
Oh ... You're the One for me, fatty 
You're the One I really, really love 
And I will stay 
Promise you'll say 
If I'm in your way
You're the One for me, fatty 
You're the One I really, really love 
And I will stay 
Promise you'll say 
If I'm ever in your ...
A-hey 
All over Battersea 
Some hope; and some despair 
All over Battersea 
Some hope; and some despair 
Oh, oh ... You're the One for me, fatty 
You're the One I really, really love 
And I will stay 
Promise you'll say 
If I'm ever in your way
A-hey 
You're the One for me, fatty 
You're the One for me, a-hey-hey 
A-hey A-hey A-hey A-he-he-he-hey

 

SEASICK, YET STILL DOCKED

I am a poor freezingly cold soul 
So far from where 
I intended to go 
Scavenging through life's very constant lulls 
So far from where I'm determined to go 
Wish I knew the way to reach the one I love
There is no way ... 
Wish I had the charm to attract the one I love 
But you see, I've got no charm 
Mmm...
Tonight I've consumed much more than I can hold 
Oh, this is very clear to you 
And you can tell I have never really loved 
You can tell, by the way, I sleep all day
And all of my life no-one gave me anything 
No-one has ever given me anything 
My love is as sharp as a needle in your eye 
You must be such a fool 
To pass me by

 

I KNOW IT'S GONNA HAPPEN SOMEDAY

My love, wherever you are 
Whatever you are 
Don't lose faith 
I know it's gonna happen someday 
To you 
Please wait ... Please wait ... Oh ... Wait ... 
Don't lose faith 
You say that the day just never arrives 
And it's never seemed so far away 
Still, I know it's gonna happen someday 
To you 
Please wait ... 
Don't lose faith

 

TOMORROW

Tomorrow 
Will it really come ? 
And if it does come 
Will I still be Human ? 
All I ask of you is one thing that you never do 
Would you put your arms around me ? 
(I won't tell anyone) 
Tomorrow 
Does it have to come ?
All I ask of you is one thing that you'll never do 
Would you put your arms around me ? 
(I won't tell anybody) 
Tomorrow 
And what must come before ...
Oh, the pain in my arms 
Oh, the pain in my legs 
Ooh, my shiftless body 
Tomorrow 
It's surely nearer now ? 
You don't think I'll make it 
I never said I wanted to ! 
Well did I ? 
Oh, the pain in my arms 
Oh, the pain in my legs 
Oh, yeah; oh, yeah, No, yeah; no, yeah 
Through my shiftless body 
Tomorrow, Tomorrow 
All I ask of you ... oh ... 
Is : would you tell me that you love me 
Tell me, tell me that you love me, Tell me, tell me that you love me ... 
Ah, I know you don't mean it 
Ah, I know you don't mean it 
Tell me, tell me that you love me, Tell me, tell me that you love me ...

 

YOU'RE THE ONE FOR ME, FATTY

You're the One for me, fatty 
You're the One I really, really love 
And I will stay 
Promise you'll say 
If I'm in your way
You're the One for me, fatty 
You're the One I really, really love 
And I will stay 
Promise you'll say 
If I'm ever in your ... A-hey 
All over Battersea 
Some hope; and some despair 
All over Battersea 
Some hope; and some despair 
Oh ... You're the One for me, fatty 
You're the One I really, really love 
And I will stay 
Promise you'll say 
If I'm in your way
You're the One for me, fatty

CERTAIN PEOPLE I KNOW

I take the cue from 
Certain people I know 
I use the cue And then I 
Hand it on to you 
And when I swing it 
So, it catches his eye ... 
(Weren't you there ? 
- You'd have died !) 
I trust the views of 
Certain people I know 
They look at Danger 
And they 
LAUGH THEIR HEADS OFF 
Their clothes are Imitation 
George the 23rd 
(Don't you find this absurd ?) 
I'd hate to be like 
Certain people I know 
They break their necks 
And can't afford to
Get them fixed 
Ah, they'd sacrifice all 
Of their principles for 
anything cashable 
I do believe it's terrible 
Oh, wo, wo Ah, ah, ah, ah Oh, wo, wo...

 

THE NATIONAL FRONT DISCO

David, the wind blows 
The wind blows ... 
Bits of your life away 
Your friends all say ... 
"Where is our boy ? Oh, we've lost our boy" 
But they should know 
Where you've gone 
Because again and again you've explained that 
You're going to ... 
Oh, you're going to ... 
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah 
England for the English ! 
England for the English ! 
David, the winds blow 
The winds blow ...
All of my dreams away 
And I still say : 
"Where is our boy ? Ah, we've lost our boy" 
But I should know 
Why you've gone 
Because again and again you've explained
You've gone to the ... 
National, ah ... To the National .. 
There's a country; you don't live there 
But one day you would like to 
And if you show them what you're made of 
Oh, then you might do ... 
But David, we wonder 
We wonder if the thunder 
Is ever really gonna begin 
Begin, begin 
Your mom says : 
"I've lost my boy" 
But she should know 
Why you've gone 
Because again and again you've explained 
You've gone to the : 
National, To the National 
To the National Front Disco 
Because you want the day to come sooner 
You want the day to come sooner 
You want the day to come sooner 
When you've settled the score 
Oh, the National, Oh, the National…

 

NOVEMBER SPAWNED A MONSTER

Sleep on and dream of Love
because it's the closest you will get to love
poor twisted child, so ugly, so ugly
poor twisted child, oh hug me, oh hug me
one November spawned a monster 
in the shape of this child who later cried
"But Jesus made me, so Jesus save me from
pity, sympathy and people discussing me"
a frame of useless limbs what can make GOOD
all the BAD that's been done?
And if the lights were out
could you even bear
to kiss her full on the mouth (or anywhere?)
poor twisted child, so ugly, so ugly
poor twisted child, oh hug me, oh hug me
one November spawned a monster 
in the shape of this child who must remain
a hostage to kindess and the wheels underneath her
a hostage to kindess and the wheels underneath her
a symbol of where mad, mad lovers
must PAUSE and draw the line
So sleep and dream of love
because it's the closest
you will get to love
that November is a time which I must put OUT of my mind
oh one fine day 
LET IT BE SOON
she won't be rich or beautiful
but she'll be walking your streets
in the clothes that she went out
and chose for herself

 

SEASICK, YET STILL DOCKED

I am a poor freezingly cold soul 
So far from where 
I intended to go 
Scavenging through life's very constant lulls 
So far from where I'm determined to go 
Wish I knew the way to reach the one I love
There is no way ... 
Wish I had the charm to attract the one I love 
But you see, I've got no charm 
Mmm...
Tonight I've consumed much more than I can hold 
Oh, this is very clear to you 
And you can tell I have never really loved 
You can tell, by the way, I sleep all day
And all of my life no-one gave me anything 
No-one has ever given me anything 
My love is as sharp as a needle in your eye 
You must be such a fool 
To pass me by

 

THE LOOP

I just wanna say 
I haven't been away 
I'm still right here 
Where I always was 
So one day, if you're bored 
By all means call 
Because you can do 
(But only if you want to) 
I just wanna say 
I haven't been away 
I am still right here 
Where I always was 
So one day, when you're bored 
By all means call 
Because you can do 
But you might not get through

 

SISTER I'M A POET

All over this town 
Yes, a low wind may blow 
And I can see through everybo... 
With no reason 
To hide these words I feel 
And no reason 
To talk about the books I read 
But still I do 
That's 'cause I'm a ... Sister I'm a ... 
All over this town 
Along this way 
Outside the prison gates 
I love the romance of crime 
And I wonder 
Does anybody feel the way I do ? 
And is evil just something you are 
Or something you do ? 
Sister I'm a ... Sister I'm a ... 
All over this town, All over this town 
They pull over 
In their Citroen vans 
Not to shake your hand 
With meths on their breaths 
And you with youth on your side 
A plastic bag stranded at the lights 
This once was me ...
But now I'm a ... Sister I'm a ...
All over this town ... Oh, oh, oh 
All over this town, All over this town, Oh ... 
I still cannot speak French ... I am very lazy

 

JACK THE RIPPER

Oh, you look so tired 
Mouth slack and wide 
Ill-housed and ill-advised 
Your face is as mean 
As your life has been 
Crash into my arms 
I WANT YOU 
You don't agree -
But you don't refuse 
I know you 
And I know a place 
Where no one is likely to pass 
Oh, you don't care if it's late 
And you don't care if you're lost 
And oh, you look so tired 
(But tonight you presumed too much) 
Too much, too much 
And if it's the last 
Thing I ever do 
I'M GONNA GET YOU 
Crash into my arms 
I WANT YOU 
You don't agree -
But you don't refuse 
I know you 
And no one knows a thing about my life 
I can come and go as I please 
And if I want to, I can stay 
Oh, or if I want to, I can leave 
Nobody knows me, Nobody knows me, Nobody knows me Oh, oh...

 

SUCH A LITTLE THING MAKES SUCH A BIG DIFFERENCE

Such a little thing, such a little thing
but the difference it made was grave
there you go
wielding a bicycle chain
oh why won't you change
cange and be nicer?
such a little thing
a gentle tone of kindness
or written words on paper
- can you write?
How I love all of
the very simple things of life
(God's good air)
how I love all of
the very simple things of life
such a little thing
a fumbling politeness
the difference it saved me
wielding a bicycle chain
"I WILL NOT CHANGE AND I WILL NOT BE NICE"
Most people keep their brains between your legs (don't you find?)
Leave me alone - I was only singing, leave me alone because
I was only singing
leave me alone - I was only singing, leave me alone
you have just proved (again)
MOST PEOPLE KEEP THEIR BRAINS BETWEEN THEIR LEGS

 

I KNOW IT'S GONNA HAPPEN SOMEDAY

My love, wherever you are 
Whatever you are 
Don't lose faith 
I know it's gonna happen someday 
To you 
Please wait ... 
Please wait ... 
Oh ... Wait ... 
Don't lose faith 
You say that the day just never arrives 
And it's never seemed so far away 
Still, I know it's gonna happen someday 
To you 
Please wait ... 
Don't lose faith

 

WE'LL LET YOU KNOW

How sad are we ? 
And how sad have we been ? 
We'll let you know, We'll let you know 
Oh, but only if - you're really interested 
You wonder how 
We've stayed alive 'till now 
We'll let you know, We'll let you know 
But only if - you're really interested 
We're all smiles 
Then, honest, I swear, it's the turnstiles 
That make us hostile 
Oh ... We will descend 
On anyone unable to defend 
Themselves 
Oh ... And the songs we sing 
They're not supposed to mean a thing 
La, la, la, la ... Oh ...
You're lonely, Oh ... you're lonely 
Oh ... 
GET OFF THE ROOF !
Oh ... Your Arsenal !
We may seem cold, or 
We may even be 
The most depressing people you've ever known 
At heart, what's left, we sadly know 
That we are the last truly British people you'll ever know 
We are the last truly British people you will ever know 
You'll never never want to know

 

SUEDHEAD

Why do you come here
why do you hang around
I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry
Why do you come here
when you know it makes
things hard for me
when you know, oh
why do you come?
Why do you telephone?
and why send me silly notes?
I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry
why do you come here
when you know it makes
thing hard for me
when you know, oh
why do you come?
You had to sneak into my room
'just' to read my diary
was it just to see all the things
you knew I'd written about you?
and...so many illustrations
I'm so very sickened
oh, I am so sickened NOW

 

HE KNOWS I'D LOVE TO SEE HIM

He Knows (he knows)
Or, I think he does
because when I lived
in the Arse of the world...
he knows, he knows, he knows I'd love
to see him happy (or as close as is allowed)
because when I lived
in the Arse of the world
he knows, he knows, he knows I'd love
to see him happy (or as close as possible
as close as possible, as close as is allowed)
My name still conjours up deadly deeds
and a bad taste in the mouth
the police - they actually knew me
they said:
"You're just another person in the world
you're just another fool with radical views
you're just another who has maddening views
you want to turn it on its head
by staying in bed!"
I said: "I know I do"

 

YOU'RE GONNA NEED SOMEONE ON YOUR SIDE

With the world's fate 
Resting on your shoulder 
You're gonna need 
Someone on your side 
You can't do it by yourself 
Any longer 
You're gonna need 
Someone on your side 
Someone kindly told me 
That you'd wasted 
Eight of nine lives
Oh, give yourself a break 
Before you break down 
You're gonna need someone on your side 
And here I am, And here I am 
Well, you don't need 
To look so pleased ! 
Day or night, 
There is no difference 
You're gonna need someone on your side 
Day or night, 
There is no difference 
You're gonna need someone soon 
And here I am, And here I am 
Well, you don't need 
To look so pleased

 

GLAMOROUS GLUE

First day with the jar 
You find 
Everyone lies 
First day with the jar 
You find 
Everyone lies, nobody minds, Everyone lies 
Where is the man you respect ? 
And where is the woman you love ? 
Where's the woman you love ? 
Third week with the jar
You find 
Everything dies 
We won't vote Conservative 
Because we never have 
Everyone lies, everyone lies 
Where is the man you respect ? 
And where is the woman you love ? 
Where's the woman you love ? 
Everything of worth 
On Earth, Is there, To share 
I used to dream, and I used to vow 
I wouldn't dream of it now 
We look to Los Angeles 
For the language we use 
London is dead, London is dead, London is dead, ...
Now I'm too much in love 
I'm too much in love, 
I know I'll go 
Empty hand 
From the land

 

WE HATE IT WHEN OUR FRIENDS BECOME SUCCESSFUL

We hate it when our friends become successful 
We hate it when our friends become successful 
Oh, look at those clothes 
Now look at that face, it's so old 
And such a video ! 
Well, it's really laughable 
Ha, ha, ha ...
We hate it when our friends become successful 
And if they're Northern, that makes it even worse
And if we can destroy them 
You bet your life we will 
Destroy them 
If we can hurt them 
Well, we may as well ... 
It's really laughable 
Ha, ha, ha ... 
You see, it should've been me 
It could've been me 
Everybody knows 
Everybody says so 
They say : 
"Ah, you have loads of songs 
So many songs 
More songs than they'd stand 
Verse 
Chorus 
Middle eight 
Break, fade 
Just listen ..."
La, la-la, la-la

 

NOW MY HEART IS FULL

There's gonna be some trouble 
A whole house will need re-building 
And everyone I love in the house 
Will recline on an analyst's couch quite 
Soon 
Your Father cracks a joke 
And in the usual way 
Empties the room 
Tell all of my friends 
(I don't have too many 
Just some rain-coated lovers' puny brothers)
Dallow, Spicer, Pinkie, Cubitt 
Rush to danger 
Wind up nowhere 
Patric Doonan - raised to wait 
I'm tired again, I've tried again, and 
Now my heart is full 
Now my heart is full 
And I just can't explain 
So I won't even try to
Dallow, Spicer, Pinkie, Cubitt 
Every jammy Stressford poet 
Loafing oafs in all-night chemists 
Loafing oafs in all-night chemists 
Underact - express depression 
Ah, but Bunnie I loved you 
I was tired again 
I've tried again, and 
Now my heart is full 
Now my heart is full 
And I just can't explain 
So I won't even try to 
Could you pass by ? 
Could you pass by ? 
Oh ... 
Now my heart is full 
Now my heart is full 
And I just can't explain 
So ... slow ... 
Slow ... slow ... slow ... slow ... slow ...

 

SPRING-HEELED JIM

Spring-heeled Jim winks an eye 
He'll "do", he'll never be "done to" 
He takes on whoever flew through 
"Well, it's the normal thing to do" ... ah ... 
Spring-heeled Jim lives to love 
Now kissing with his mouth full 
And his eyes on some other fool 
So many women 
His head should be spinning 
Ah, but no ! 
Ah, but no ! 
But no !
Ah, no !
Spring-heeled Jim slurs the words : 
"There's no need to be so knowing
Take life at five times the 
Average speed, like I do" 
Until Jim feels the chill 
"Oh, where did all the time go ?" 
Once always in for the kill 
Now it's too cold 
And he feels too 
old 
Too old
Mmm, old... 
La, la, la, la-la, la ...

 

BILLY BUDD

Say, Billy Budd 
So you think you should ? 
Oh, everyone's laughing 
Say, Billy Budd 
So you think that you should ? 
Everyone's laughing ! 
Since I took up with you 
Things have been bad 
Yeah, but now it's 12 years on 
Now it's 12 years on 
Yes, and I took up with you 
I took my job application 
Into town 
Did you hear ? They turned me down 
Yes, and it's all because of us 
Oh, and what was in our eyes 
Oh, what was in our eyes, yeah 
I said, Billy Budd 
I would happily lose 
Both of my legs 
I would lose both of my legs 
Oh, if it meant you could be free 
Oh, if it meant you could be free 
(Don't leave us in the dark!)

 

HOLD ON TO YOUR FRIENDS

A bond of trust 
Has been abused 
Something of value 
May be lost 
Give up your job 
Squander your cash - be rash 
Just hold on to your friends 
There are more than enough 
To fight and oppose 
Why waste good time 
Fighting the people you like 
Who will fall defending your name 
Oh, don't feel so ashamed 
To have friends 
But now you only call me 
When you're feeling depressed 
When you feel happy I'm 
So far from your mind 
My patience is stretched 
My loyalty vexed 
Oh, you're losing all of your friends 
Hold on to your friends 
Hold on to your friends 
Resist - or move on 
Be mad, be rash 
Smoke and explode 
Sell all of your clothes 
Just bear in mind : 
Oh, there just might come a time 
When you need some friends

 

THE MORE YOU IGNORE ME, THE CLOSER I GET

The more you ignore me 
The closer I get 
You're wasting your time 
The more you ignore me 
The closer I get 
You're wasting your time 
I will be 
In the bar 
With my head 
On the bar 
I am now 
A central part 
Of your mind's landscape 
Whether you care 
Or do not 
Yeah, I've made up your mind 
The more you ignore me 
The closer I get 
You're wasting your time 
The more you ignore me 
The closer I get 
You're wasting your time 
Beware !
I bear more grudges 
Than lonely high court judges 
When you sleep 
I will creep 
Into your thoughts 
Like a bad debt 
That you can't pay 
Take the easy way 
And give in 
Yeah, and let me in 
Oh, let me in 
Oh let me ... 
Oh, let me in 
IT'S WAR 
IT'S WAR 
WAR 
WAR 
Oh, let me in 
Ah, the closer I get 
Ah, you're asking for it 
Ah, the closer I get 
Ooh, the closer I ...

 

WHY DON'T YOU FIND OUT FOR YOURSELF

The sanest days are mad 
Why don't you find out for yourself ? 
Then you'll see the price 
Very closely 
Some men here 
They have a special interest 
In your career 
They wanna help you to grow 
And then syphon all your dough 
Why don't you find out for yourself ? 
Then you'll see the glass 
Hidden in the grass 
You'll never believe me, so 
Why don't you find out for yourself ? 
Sick down to my heart 
That's just the way it goes 
Some men here 
They know the full extent of 
Your distress 
They kneel and pray 
And they say : 
"Long may it last" 
Why don't you find out for yourself ?
Then you'll see the glass 
Hidden in the grass 
Bad scenes come and go 
For which you must allow 
Sick down to my heart 
That's just the way it goes 
Don't rake up my mistakes 
I know exactly what they are 
And ... what do YOU do ? 
Well ... you just SIT THERE 
I've been stabbed in the back 
So many many times 
I don't have any skin 
But that's just the way it goes

 

I AM HATED FOR LOVING

I am hated for loving 
I am hated for loving 
Anonymous call, a poison pen 
A brick in the small of the back again 
I still don't belong 
To anyone - I am mine 
And I am hated for loving 
I am haunted for wanting 
Anonymous call, a poison pen 
A brick in the ... ah ... 
A brick in the small of the back again 
I still don't belong 
To anyone - I am mine 
I am falling 
With no-one to catch me 
I am falling 
And there's still 
No-one to catch me 
Ah .. 
Anonymous call, a poison pen 
A brick in the ... ah ... 
A brick in the small of the back again 
I just don't belong 
To anywhere 
I just don't belong 
Mmm ... 
Ah ...

 

LIFEGUARD SLEEPING, GIRL DROWNING

Always looking for attention 
Always needs to be mentioned 
Who does she 
Think she should be ? 
The shrill cry through darkening air 
Doesn't she know he's 
Had such a busy day ? 
Tell her ... sshhh
Somebody tell her ... sshhh 
Slowest ... 
It was only a test 
But she swam too far 
Against the tide 
She deserves all she gets 
The sky became marked with stars 
As an out-stretched arm slowly 
Disappears 
Hooray 
Oh hooray 
No, oh, oh, woh, there's no movement 
No, oh, hooray 
Oh, hooray 
Please don't worry 
There'll be no fuss 
She was ... nobody's nothing 
(What's your name ?) 
When he awoke 
The sea was calm 
And another day passes like a dream 
There's no ... no way 
(What's your name ?)

 

USED TO BE A SWEET BOY

Used to be a sweet boy 
Holding so tightly 
To Daddy's hand 
But that was all 
In some distant land 
Blazer and tie 
And a big bright healthy smile 
Used to make all 
Of our trials worthwhile 
Used to be a sweet boy 
And I'm not to blame 
Something went wrong 
And I know 
I'm not to blame 
Something went wrong 
Can't be to blame 
Ah ...

 

THE LAZY SUNBATHERS

A world war 
Was announced 
Days ago 
But they didn't know 
The lazy sunbathers 
The lazy sunbathers 
The sun burns through 
To the planet's core 
And it isn't enough 
They want more 
Nothing 
Appears 
To be 
Between the ears of 
The lazy sunbathers 
Too jaded 
To question stagnation 
The sun burns through 
To the planet's core 
And it isn't enough 
They want more 
Religions fall 
Children shelled 
"...Children shelled ? That's all 
Very well, but would you 
Please keep the noise 
Down low ? 
Because you're waking 
The lazy sunbathers ..."
Oh, the lazy sunbathers 
The lazy sunbathers

 

SPEEDWAY

And when you slam 
Down the hammer 
Can you see it in your heart ? 
All of the rumours 
Keeping me grounded 
I never said, I never said that they were 
Completely unfounded 
So when you slam 
Down the hammer 
Can you see it in your heart ? 
Can you delve so low ? 
And when you're standing 
On my fingers 
Can you see it in your heart ? ... ah ... 
And when you try 
To break my spirit 
It won't work 
Because there's nothing left to break 
Anymore 
All of the rumours 
Keeping me grounded 
I never said, I never said that they were 
Completely unfounded 
You won't sleep 
Until the earth that wants me 
Finally has me 
Oh you've done it now 
You won't rest 
Until the hearse that becomes me 
Finally takes me 
Oh you've done it now 
And you won't smile 
Until my loving mouth 
Is shut good and proper 
FOREVER 
All of the rumours 
Keeping me grounded 
I never said, I never said that they were 
Completely unfounded 
And all those lies 
Written lies, twisted lies 
Well, they weren't lies 
They weren't lies 
They weren't lies 
I never said 
I never said 
I could have mentioned your name 
I could have dragged you in 
Guilt by implication 
By association 
I've always been true to you 
In my own strange way 
I've always been true to you 
In my own sick way 
I'll always stay true to you

 

THE TEACHERS ARE AFRAID OF THE PUPILS

There's too many people 
Planning your downfall 
When your spirit's on trial 
These nights can be frightening 
Sleep transports sadness 
To some other mid-brain 
And somebody here 
Will not be here next year 
So you stand by the board 
Full of fear and intention 
And, if you think that they're listening 
Well, you've got to be joking 
Oh, you understand change 
And you think it's essential 
But when your profession 
Is humiliation 
Say the wrong word to our children ...
We'll have you, oh yes, we'll have you 
Lay a hand on our children 
And it's never too late to have you 
Mucus on your collar 
A nail up through the staff chair 
A blade in your soap 
And you cry into your pillow 
To be finished would be a relief 
To be finished would be a relief... 
Say the wrong word to our children ...
We'll have you, oh yes, we'll have you 
Lay a hand on our children 
And it's never too late to have you 
To be finished would be a relief 
To be finished would be a relief...
I'm very glad this thing has come 
Sometimes I'm so glad 
Never bother to play the tunes 
I've seen it coming for dear life

 

READER MEET AUTHOR

You don't know a thing about their lives 
They live where you wouldn't dare to drive
You shake as you think of how they sleep 
But you write as if you are my side-by-side 
Reader, meet Author 
With the hope of hearing sense 
But you may be feeling let down 
By the words of defence 
He says : "No-one ever sees me when I cry"
You don't know a thing about their lives 
Books don't save them, books aren't Stanley knives 
And if a fight broke out here tonight 
You'd be the first away, because you're that type 
And the Year 2000 won't change anyone here 
As each fabled promise flies so fast 
You'll swear it was never there 
Oh, have you ever escaped from a shipwrecked life ? 
So safely with your software; all miles from the front line 
You hear the way their sad voices, and you start to imagine things 
Oh, any excuse to write more lies

 

THE BOY RACER

He's just too good-natured and 
He's got too much money and 
He's got too many girlfriends 
I'm jealous, that's all 
Have you seen him go, though, oh ? 
Have you seen him go, though, oh ? 
Boy racer, Boy racer, oh 
We're gonna kill this pretty thing 
Boy racer, Boy racer, oh 
We're gonna kill this pretty thing 
He's got many girlfriends 
He thinks he owns this city 
He overspeeds and he never gets pulled over 
Have you seen him go, though, oh ? 
Have you seen him go, though, oh ? 
Boy racer, Boy racer, oh 
We're gonna kill this pretty thing 
Boy racer, Boy racer, oh 
We're gonna kill this pretty thing 
He thinks he got the whole world in his hands 
Stood at the urinal 
He thinks he got the whole world in his hands 
And I'm gonna ... kill him !
Oh, no ! Oh, no ! Oh, no ! Oh, no ! Oh, no !Oh .... 
Boy racer Boy racer, oh 
We're gonna kill this pretty thing...
He's just too good-looking, and, And, and ... 
Boy racer Boy racer, oh 
We're gonna kill this pretty thing...

 

THE OPERATION

You fight with your right hand 
And caress with your left hand 
Everyone I know is sick to death of you 
With a tear that's a mile wide 
In the kite that you're flying 
Everyone I know is sick to death of you 
Ever since 
You don't look the same 
You're just not the same, no way 
You say clever things and 
You never used to 
You don't catch what I'm saying 
When you're deafened to advice 
Everyone here is sick to the 
Back teeth of you 
With a tear that's a mile wide 
In the kite that you're flying 
Everyone here is sick to the 
Tattoo of you 
Ever since 
You don't look the same 
You're just not the same, no way 
You say pleasant things and 
There is no need to
Still, you fight with your right hand 
And caress with your left hand 
Ooh, ooh ... Sad to say ... 
How once I was in love with you 
Sad to say ... 
You don't catch what I'm saying 
When you're deafened to advice 
Ooh, ooh ... Ever since 
You don't look the same 
You're just not the same, no way 
What the hell have 
They stuck into you ?

 

DAGENHAM DAVE

Head in the clouds, and a mouthful of pie 
Head in a blouse, everybody loves him 
I see why 
Dagenham Dave, Dagenham Dave, Oh, Dagenham Dave 
Dagenham Dave, Dagenham Dave, Oh, Dagenham Dave 
"I love Karen, I love Sharon" on the windowscreen 
With never the need to fight or to question a single thing 
Dagenham Dave, Dagenham Dave Oh, Dagenham Dave 
Dagenham Dave, Dagenham Dave Oh, Dagenham Dave ...
He'd love to touch, he's afraid that he might self-combust 
I could say more, but you get the general idea 
Dagenham Dave, Dagenham Dave Dagenham Dave, Dagenham Dave 
Dagenham, Dagenham Dagenham Dave, Dagenham Dave ...
Oh, Dave, oh, Dagenham, dagenham, Oh, Dave, oh, Dave, ...

 

DO YOUR BEST AND DON'T WORRY

Compare the best of their days 
With the worst of your days 
You won't win 
With your standards so high 
And your spirits so low 
At least remember ... 
This is you on a bad day, you on a pale day 
Just do your best and don't ... Don't worry, oh 
The way you hang yourself is oh, so unfair 
See the best of how they look 
Against the worst of how you are
And again, you won't win 
With your standards so high 
And your spirits so low 
At least remember ... 
This is you on a drab day, you in a drab dress 
Just do your best and don't ... Don't worry, oh 
The way you hang yourself is oh, so unfair 
Just do your best and don't ... Don't worry, oh 
The way you watch yourself is oh, so unfair 
Just do your best and don't ... Don't worry, oh 
Do your best and don't ...

SOUTHPAW

You were a boy before you became a man 
I don't see the joy 
And you ran with your pals in the sun 
You turned around and they were gone 
Again ... 
A sick boy should be treated 
So easily defeated 
Oh, I just don't understand 
So you ran with your pals in the sun 
You turned around 
You were alone 
Again ... 
And you ran back to Ma 
Which set the pace for the rest of your days 
Oh, you ran back to Ma 
Which set the pace for the rest of your days 
Oh, you ran back to Ma 
Which set the pace for the rest of your days 
And now, there is something that you should know 
There is something that you should know 
The girl of your dreams is 
Here all alone 
Girl of your dreams is 
Here all alone 
The girl of your dreams is 
Sad and all alone 
The girl of your dreams is 
Here all alone 
There is something that you should know 
There is something that you should know 
Girl of your dreams is 
Here all alone 
The girl of your dreams is 
Sad and is all alone 
The girl of your dreams is 
Sad and is feeling all alone 
Oh, there is something that you should know 
Help me, help me, help me ...

 

MALADJUSTED

I wanna start from 
Before the beginning 
Loot wine, "Be mine, and 
Then let's stay out for the night"
Ride via Parkside 
Semi-perilous lives 
Jeer the lights in the windows 
Of all safe and stable homes 
(But wondering then, well what 
Could peace of mind be like ?)
Anyway do you want to hear 
Our story, or not ? 
As the Fulham Road lights 
Stretch and invite into the night 
From a Stevenage overspill 
We'd kill to live around 
SW6 - with someone like you 
Keep thieves' hours 
With someone like you 
...As long as it slides 
You stalk the house 
In a low-cut blouse : 
"Oh Christ, another stifled 
Friday night !"
And the Fulham Road lights 
Stretch and invite into the night 
Well, I was fifteen 
What could I know ?
When the gulf between 
All the things I need 
And the things I receive 
Is an ancient ocean 
Wide, wild, lost, uncrossed 
Still I maintain there's nothing 
Wrong with you 
You do all that you do 
Because it's all you can do 
Well, I was fifteen 
Where could I go ?
With a soul full of loathing 
For stinging bureaucracy 
Making it anything 
Other than easy 
For working girls like me 
With my hands on my head 
I flop on your bed 
With a head full of dread 
For all I've ever said 
Maladjusted, maladjusted 
Maladjusted maladjusted 
Never to be trusted 
Oh, never to be trusted 
There's nothing wrong with you, oh 
...There's nothing wrong with you

 

ALMA MATTERS

So : the choice I have made 
May seem strange to you 
But who asked you, anyway ? 
It's my life to wreck 
My own way 
You see : to someone, somewhere, oh yeah ... 
Alma matters 
In mind, body and soul 
In part, and in whole 
Because to someone, somewhere, oh yeah ... 
Alma matters 
In mind, body and soul 
In part, and in whole 
So the life I have made 
May seem wrong to you 
But, I've never been surer 
It's my life to ruin 
My own way 
You see : to someone, somewhere, oh yeah ... 
Alma matters 
In mind, body and soul 
In part, and in whole 
Because to someone, somewhere, oh yeah ... 
Alma matters 
In mind, body and soul 
In part, and in whole 
To someone, somewhere, oh yeah ... 
Alma matters 
In mind, body and soul 
Part, and in whole 
So to someone, somewhere, oh yeah ... 
Alma matters 
In mind, body and soul 
Part, and in whole 
To someone, somewhere, oh yeah ... 
Oh yeah ... Oh yeah, oh yeah Oh yeah ...

 

AMBITIOUS OUTSIDERS

Bolt-lock your doors 
Alarm your cars 
And still we move in closer 
Every day 
Top of the list 
Is your smiling kids 
But we'll be smiling too 
So that's OK 
Oh, and by the way 
Thank you, because you're 
Giving, giving, giving 
And we're receiving - 
No, no, we're taking 
Keeping the population down 
Your taxes paid, but 
Police waylaid 
And we knows 
When the school bus 
Comes and goes 
We're on your street, but 
You don't see us 
Or, if you do 
You smile and say Hello 
BUT DON'T UNDERESTIMATE US 
When you are 
Giving, giving, giving 
And we're receiving - 
No, no, we're taking 
Just keeping 
The population down 
You're giving, giving, giving 
Well, it's your own fault 
For reproducing 
We're just keeping 
The population down

 

TROUBLE LOVES ME

Trouble loves me 
Trouble needs me 
Two things 
More than you do 
Or would attempt to 
So, console me 
Otherwise, hold me 
Just when it seems like 
Everything's evened out 
And the balance 
Seems serene 
Trouble loves me 
Walks beside me 
To chide me 
Not to guide me 
It's still much more 
Than you'll do 
So, console me 
Otherwise, hold me 
Just when it seems like 
Everything's evened out 
And the balance seems serene 
See the fool I'll be 
Still running 'round 
On the flesh rampage 
Still running 'round 
Ready with ready-wit 
Still running 'round 
On the flesh rampage 
- At your age ! 
Go to Soho, oh 
Go to waste in 
The wrong arms 
Still running 'round 
Trouble loves me 
Seeks and finds me 
To charlatanize me 
Which is only 
As it should be 
Oh, please fulfill me 
Otherwise, kill me 
Show me a barrel and watch me scrape it 
Faced with the music, as always I'll face it 
In the half-light 
So English, frowning 
Then at midnight I 
Can't get you out of my head 
A disenchanted taste 
Still running 'round 
A disenchanted taste 
Still running 'round

 

PAPA JACK

Papa Jack 
Wants to turn 
Back the clock 
And reach out 
To the kids 
He once had 
Who have flown 
Papa Jack 
In decline 
Feels inclined 
To reach out 
To the kids 
He once had 
Who have flown 
But there was a time 
When the kids reached up 
And Papa Jack just 
Pushed them away 
Looking deep 
In his heart 
Papa Jack 
Doesn't like 
What he sees 
Or the time 
On his hands 
The dying day 
The chilly sun 
Papa Jack 
All alone 
Sings slow 
Grieving and low 
But there was a time 
When the kids reached up 
Now you can't always 
Have it your way 
Papa Jack 
Ah ...

 

AMMUNITION

I know these roads 
Each ridge 
And narrow bridge 
Each cheveron 
Enticing me on 
Each warning sign 
I take in my stride 
I don't need more ammunition 
I've got more than I can spend 
I don't dwell on things I'm missing 
I'm just pleased 
With the things I've found 
I know these roads 
An old hand understands 
Above all, I know what's 
Expected of me now 
Veering cliffwards 
I don't need more ammunition 
I've got more than I can spend 
I don't dwell on things I'm missing 
I'm just pleased 
With the things I've found 
With the things I've found 
With the things I've found 
I've found 
I've been crying 
It comes back on these salient days 
And it stays 
And it says : 
"We've never really been away" 
I don't need more ammunition 
I've got more than I can spend 
I don't think of who I'm missing 
I've got no space and no time 
In my life, anymore 
No space or time 
In my life, anymore 
For Revenge

 

WIDE TO RECEIVE

Download something 
Useful, or useless 
Because I'm lying here 
Wide to receive 
Almost anything 
You'd care to give 
And I don't 
Get along with myself 
And I'm not too keen 
On anyone else 
Turn on, plug in 
Then just walk away 
Unlock, process 
And then just go 
And I've never felt quite so alone 
As I do right now 
I'm lying here 
Wide to receive 
Almost anything 
You'd care to leave 
Wide, wide, wide Wide, wide, wide...

 

ROY'S KEEN

(GO ON !)
He's romancing you 
And chancing his arm 
He'll be here 
Smiling on time 
He's romancing you 
And chancing his arm 
He'll be here 
Smiling on time 
Roy's keen oh Roy's keen 
Roy's keen oh Roy's keen 
We've never seen a 
Keener window-cleaner 
Back up the ladder 
Into each corner 
Dunking the chamois 
Just think of the goodwill 
The ladder's a planet 
Roy is a star, and 
I am a satellite 
(But that's alright) 
He can hold a smile for as long 
As you require (even longer) 
He can hold a smile for as long 
As you require (even longer) 
Roy's keen oh Roy's keen 
Roy's keen oh Roy's keen 
We've never seen a 
Keener window-cleaner 
Back up the ladder 
Into each corner 
Dunking the chamois 
Just think of the goodwill 
The ladder's a planet 
Roy is a star, and 
I am a satellite 
I will be set alight 
Don't say you'll hold it steady 
Then you let it go 
Don't say you'll hold it steady 
Then you let it go Oh ...
You're up the ladder 
Into each corner 
Foot in a bucket 
We trust you to wreck it 
Even when it's under your nose 
Well, you just can't 
See it, can you ? 
Well, it's here 
Right under your nose 
And you just can't 
See it, can you? La la la la ...
Roy's keen, Roy's keen La la la la ...
We've never seen a 
Keener window-cleaner 
Oh ... La la la la ...

 

HE CRIED

I need you 
Simple words 
But words which had never been heard 
By the soul 
Stoned to death 
But still living 
And so he froze where he stood 
And he looked to the ground 
And he cried 
He cried 
Ride our minds 
If you must 
But there's always a line you don't cross 
Time is short 
Don't be cruel 
Oh you don't know the power 
In what you're saying 
Oh ... 
And so he froze where he stood 
And he looked to the ground 
And he cried 
He cried 
People where 
I come from 
They survive without feelings or blood 
I never could 
Was stoned to death 
But I'm still living 
So he froze where he stood 
And he looked to the ground 
And he cried 
He cried 
So he froze 
And he looked, and he looked 
To the ground 
And he cried 
He cried

 

SORROW WILL COME IN THE END

Legalized theft 
Leaves me bereft 
I get it straight in the neck 
(Somehow expecting no less) 
A court of justice 
With no use for Truth 
Lawyer ...liar 
Lawyer ...liar 
You pleaded and squealed 
And you think you've won 
But Sorrow will come 
To you in the end 
And as sure as my words are pure 
I praise the day that brings you pain 
Q.C.'s obsessed with sleaze 
Frantic for Fame 
They're all on the game 
They just use a different name 
You lied 
And you were believed 
By a J.P. senile and vile 
You pleaded and squealed 
And you think you've won 
But Sorrow will come 
To you in the end 
And as sure as my words are pure 
I praise the day that brings you pain 
So don't close your eyes 
Don't close your eyes 
A man who slits throats 
Has time on his hands 
And I'm gonna get you 
So don't close your eyes 
Don't ever close your eyes 
You think you've won 
OH NO

 

SATAN REJECTED MY SOUL

Satan rejected my soul 
He knows my kind 
He won't be dragged down 
He's seen my face around 
He knows Heaven doesn't seem 
To be my home 
So I must find 
Somewhere else to go 
So I must find 
Somewhere else to go 
So, take it - please 
It's free 
You'll never see 
You'll never see 
All the fun in life it's cost me 
Satan rejected my soul 
As low as he goes 
He never quite goes this low 
He's seen my face around 
He knows Heaven doesn't seem 
To be my home 
So I must find 
Somewhere else to go 
So I must find 
Somewhere else to go 
So, take it please 
It's really sly 
Come on, come on, ah Come on, come on, come on 
Take it please, It's really sly 
Come on, come on, ah Come on, come on, come on 
Call me in, Pull me in, call me in 
Come on, come on, oh Come on, come on, come on 
Pull me in, pull me in, Call me in, haul me in, pull me in 
Come on, come on, ah, Come on, come on 
La la la la la, Oh ...

 
 REEL AROUND THE FOUNTAIN

It's time the tale was told
of how you took a child
and you made him old
Reel around the fountain
slap me on the patio
I'll take it now
Fifteen minutes with you
well, I wouldn't say no
people said that you were virtually dead
and they were so wrong
fifteen minutes with you
well, i wouldn't say no
people said that you were easily led
and they were half-right
I dreamt about you last night
and i fell out of bed twice
you can pin and mount me like a butterfly
but take me to the haven of your bed
was something that you never said
two lumps, please
you're the bee's knees
but so am I
Meet me at the fountain
shove me on the patio
I'll take it slowly
Fifteen minutes with you
oh I wouldn't say no
people see no worth in you
oh but I do

 

YOU'VE GOT EVERYTHING NOW

As merry as the days were long
I was right and you were wrong
back at the old grey school
I would win and you would lose
But you've got everything now
and what a terrible mess I've made of my life
No, I've never had a job
because I've never wanted one
I've seen you smile
but I've never really heard you laugh
So who is rich and who is poor?
I cannot say...
You are your mother's only son
and you're a desperate one
But I don't want a lover
I just want to be seen in the back of your car
A friendship sadly lost?
Well, this is true ...and yet, it's false
Did I ever tell you , by the way
I never did like your face
But you've got everything now
and what a terrible mess I've made of my life
No, I've never had a job
because I'm too shy
But I don't want a lover
I just want to be tied to the back of your car.

 

MISERABLE LIE

So, goodbye
please stay with your own kind
and I'll stay with mine
There's something against us
it's not time
So, goodbye
I know I hardly say
how much I love your casual way
but please put your tongue away
a little higher and we're well away
the dark nights are drawing in
and your humour is as black as them
I look at yours, you laugh at mine
and"love" is just a miserable lie
you have destroyed my flower like-life
not once-but twice
you have corrupt my innocent mind
not once-but twice
I know that wind-swept mystical air
it means: I'd like to see your underwear
I recognise that mystical air
it means: I'd like to see your underwear
what do we get for the trouble and pain?
just a rented room in Whalley Range
into the depths of the criminal world
I followed her...
I need advice, I need advice
because nobody ever looks at me twice
I'm just a country-mile behind
the world
I'm just a country mile behind
the whole world
so take me when you go

 

PRETTY GIRLS MAKE GRAVES

Upon the sand,upon the bay
"there is a quick and easy way" you say
before you illustrate
I'd rather state:
"I'm not the man you think I am
I'm not the man you think I am "
And Sorrow's native son
he will not smile for anyone
And pretty girls makes the graves
End of the pier, end of the bay
you tug my arm and say:"Give into lust,
give up to lust, oh heaven knows we'll
soon be dust..."
But I'm not the man you think I am
I'm not the man you think I am
And Sorrow's native son
he will not rise for anyone
And pretty girls make graves
I could have been wild and I could have been free
but Nature played this trick on me
She wants it Now
and she will not wait
but she's too rough
and I'm too delicate
Then on the sand
another man, he takes her hand
and a smile lights up her stupid face
(and well, it would)
I lost my faith in Womanhood
I lost my faith in Womanhood, I lost my faith

 

THE HAND THAT ROCKS THE CRADLE

Please don't cry
the ghost and the storm outside
will not invade this sacred shire
nor infiltrate your mind
my life down I shall lie
if the bogey-man should try
to play tricks on your sacred mind
to tease, torment and tantalise
wavering shadows loom
a piano plays in an empty room
there'll be blood on the cleaver tonight
when darkness lifts and the room is bright
I'll still be by your side
for you are all that matters
and I'll love you till the day I die
there never need to be longing in your eyes
as long as the hand that rocks the cradle is mine
ceiling shadows shimmy by
and when the wardrobe towers like a beast of prey
there's a sadness in your beautiful eyes
you're untouched, unsoiled, wonderous eyes
my life down I shall lie
should restless spirts try
to play tricks on you sacred mind
but whom I never gave a name
I just looked into his wonderous eyes
and said" never never never again"
all too soon I did return
just like a moth to a flame
so rattle my bones all over the stones
because I'm only a beggar-man whom nobody owns
see how words as old as sin
fit me like a glove I'm here and here I'll stay
together we lie, together we pray
there never need be longing in your eyes
as long as the hand that rocks the cradle is mine

 

STILL ILL

I decree today that life
is simply taking and not giving
England is mine and it owes me a living
ask me why, and I'll spit in your eye
ask me why, and I'll spit in your eye
but we cannot cling to the old dreams anymore
no, we cannot cling to the old dreams anymore
Does the body rule the mind
or does the mind rule the body?
I dunno...
Under the iron bridge we kissed
and although I ended up with sore lips
it just wasn't like the old days anymore
no, it wasn't like those days
am I still ill?
Does the body rule the mind
or does the mind rule the body ?
I dunno...
Ask me why, and I'll die
ask me why, and I'll die
and if you must go to work tomorrow
well, if I were you I wouldn't bother
for there are brighter sides to life
and I should know because I've seen them
but not very often...
under the iron bridge we kissed
and although I ended up with sore lips
it just wasn't like the old days anymore
no, it wasn't like those days
am I still ill?

 

HAND IN GLOVE

Hand in glove
the sun shines out of our behinds
no, it's not like any other love
this one is different-because it's us
Hand in glove
we can go wherever we please
and everything depends upon
how near you stand to me
And if the people stare
then the people stare
I really don't know and I really don't care
Hand in glove
the Good People laugh
yes, we may be hidden by rags
but we have something they'll never have
So, hand in glove I stake my claim
I'll fight to the last breath
If they dare touch a hair on your head
I'll fight to the last breath
The Good Life is out there, somewhere
so stay on my arm, you little charmer
But I know my luck too well
and I'll probably never see you again.

 

WHAT DIFFERENCE DOES IT MAKE?

All men have secrets and here is mine
so let it be known
we have been through hell and high tide,
I can surely rely on you?
and yet you start to recoil,
heavy words are so lightly thrown
but still I'd leap in front of a flying bullet for you
So, what difference does it make?
so, what difference does it make?
it makes none
but you have gone
and you must be looking very old tonight
The devil will find work for idle hands to do
I stole and I lied, and why?
because you asked me to!
but now you make feel so ashamed
because I've only got two hands
well, I'm still fond of you
So, what difference does it make?
so, what difference does it make?
it makes none
but you have gone
and your prejudice won't keep you warm tonight
So, no more apologies
no more apologies
I'm too tired
I'm too sick and tired
and I'm feeling very sick and ill today
But I'm still fond of you

 

I DON'T OWE YOU ANYTHING

Bought on stolen wine
a nod was the first step
you know very well
what was coming next
did I really walk all this way
just to hear you say
"oh I don't want to go out tonight"
but you will
for you must
I don't owe you anything
but you owe me something
repay me now
you should never go to them
let them come to you
just like I do
you should not go to them
let them come to you
just like I do
Too freely on your lips
words prematurely said
oh but I know what will make you smile tonight
Life is never kind
life is never kind
oh but I know what will make you smile tonight

 

SUFFER LITTLE CHILDREN

Over the moors,take me to the moors
dig a shallow grave
and I'll lay me down
Lesley-Anne, with your pretty white beads
oh John, you'll never be a man
and you'll never see your home again
oh Manchester, so much to answer for
Edward, see those alluring lights?
tonight will be your very last night
a woman said "I know my son is dead
I'll never rest my hands on his scared head"
Hindley wakes and Hindley says:
"Wherever he has gone, I have gone "
But fresh lilaced moorland fields
cannot hide the stoild stench of death
Hindley wakes and Hindley says:
"Whatever he has done, I have done"
But this is no easy ride
for a child cries
"find me...find me, nothing more
we're on a sullen misty moor
we may be dead and we may be gone
but we will be right by your side
until the day you die
this is no easy ride
we will haunt you when you laugh
yes, you could say we're a team
you might sleep
BUT YOU WILL NEVER DREAM!"
Oh Manchester, so much to answer for
Oh Manchester, so much to answer for
Over the moor, I'm on the moor
the child is on the moor

 

THE HEADMASTER RITUAL

Belligerent ghouls
run Manchester schools
spineless swines
cemented mines
Sir leads the troops
jealous of youth
same old suit since 1962
he does the military two-step
down the nape of my neck
I wanna go home
I don't want to stay
give up education
is a bad mistake
mid-week on the playing fields
Sir thwacks you on the knees
knees you in the groin
elbow in the face
I wanna go home
I don't want to stay
Belligerent ghouls
run Manchester schools
spineless bastards all
Sir leads the troops
jealous of youth
same old jokes since 1902
he does the military two-step
down the nape of my neck
I wanna go home
I don't want to stay

as a bad mistake
please excuse me from gym
I've got this terrible cold coming on

RUSHOLME RUFFIANS

The last night at the fair
by the big wheel generator
a boy is stabbed
and his money is grabbed
and the air hangs heavy like a dulling wine
she is famous
she is funny
an engagement ring
doesn't mean a thing
to a mind consumed by brass(money)
and though I walk home alone
my faith in love is still devout
the last night at the fair
from a seat on a whirling waltzer
her skirt ascends for a watching eye
it's a hideous trait( on her mother's side)
and though I walk home alone
my faith in love is still devout
then someone falls in love
and someone's beaten up
and the senses being dulled are mine

of a speedway operator
is all a tremulous heart requires
a schoolgirl is denied
she said "How quickly would I die
if I jumped from the top of the parachutes?"

I WANT THE ONE I CAN'T HAVE

On the day that your mentality
catches up with your biology
I want the one I can't have
and it's driving me mad
it's written all over my face
A double-bed
and a stalwart lover, for sure
these are the riches of the poor
A double-bed
and a stalwart lover, for sure
these are the riches of the poor
a tough kid who sometimes swallows nails
raised on Prisoner's Aid
he killed a policeman when he was thirteen
and somehow that really impressed me
it's written all over my face
On the day that your mentality
catches up with your biology
And if you ever need self-validation
just meet me in the alley by the
railway-station
it's written all over my face

 

WHAT SHE SAID

What she said:
"How come someone hasn't noticed
that I'm dead
and decided to bury me
God knows, I'm ready"
What she said was
but then, all the rejection she's had
to pretend to be happy
could only be idiocy
What she said was not for the job or
lover that she never had
What she read
all heady books
she'd sit and prophesise
(it took a tattoed boy from Birkenhead
to really really open her eyes)

THAT JOKE ISN'T FUNNY ANYMORE

Park the car at the side of the road
you should know
time's tide will smother you
and I will too
when you laugh about other people who feel so
very lonely
their only desire is to die
well I'm afraid
it doesn't make me smile
I wish I could laugh
but that joke isn't funny anymore
it's too close to home and it's too near the bone
it's too close to home and it's too near the bone
more than you'll ever know
It was dark as I drove the point home
and on cold leather seats
well, it suddenly struck me
I just might die with a smile on my
face after all
I've seen this happen in other people's lives
and now it's happening in mine

 

NOWHERE FAST

I'd like to drop my trousers to the world
I am a man of means(of slender means)
each household appliance
is like a new science in my town
and if a day came when I felt a natural emotion
I'd get such a shock I'd probably jump in the ocean
and when a train goes by
it's such a sad sound
I'd like to drop my trousers to the Queen
every sensible child will know what this means
the poor and the needy
are selfish and greedy on her terms
and if the day came when I felt a natural emotion
I'd get such a shock I'd probably jump in the ocean
and when a train goes by
it's such a sad song
And when I'm lying in my bed
I think about life
and I think about death
and neither one particularly appeals to me
and if the day came when I felt a natural emotion
I'd get such a shock I'd probably lie
in the middle of the street and die
I'd lie down and die

 

WELL I WONDER

Well I wonder
do you hear me when you sleep?
I hoarsely cry
Well I wonder
do you see me when we pass?
I half-die
Please keep me in mind
please keep me in mind
Gasping-but somehow still alive
this is the fierce last stand of all I am
Gasping-dying-but somehow still alive
this is the final stand of all I am
Please keep me in mind

 

BARBARISM BEGINS AT HOME

Unruly boys
who will not grow up
must be taken in hand
Unruly girls
who will not settle down
they must be taken in hand
A crack on the head
is what you get for not asking
and a crack on the head

MEAT IS MURDER

Heifer whines could be human cries
closer comes the screaming knife
this beautiful creature must die
this beautiful creature must die
a death for no reason
and death for reason is MURDER
and the flesh you so fancifully fry
is not succulent, tasty or nice
it's death for no reason
and death for no reason is MURDER
and the calf that you carve with a smile
is MURDER
and the turkey you festively slice
is MURDER
do you know how animals die?
kitchen aroma aren't very homely
it's not "comforting," "cheery" or kind
it's sizzling blood and the unholy stench
of MURDER
it's not "natural," "normal" or kind
the fleas you so fancifully fry
as you savour the flavour
of MURDER
NO, NO, NO, IT'S MURDER
NO, NO, NO, IT'S MURDER
who hears when animals cry?

 

THE QUEEN IS DEAD

Farewell to this lands cheerless marches
hemmed in like a boar between arches
her very Lowness with her head in a sling
Im truely sorry-but it sounds like a wonderful thing
dear Charles, dont you ever crave
to appear on the front of the Daily mail
dressed in your Mother's bridal veil?
So, I checked all the registered historical facts
and I was shocked into shame to discover
how Im the 18th pale descendent
of some, old queen or other
has the world changed, or have I changed?
has the world changed, or have I changed?
as some 9-year old tough peddles drugs
(I never even knew what drugs were)
And so, I broke into the Palace
with a sponge and a rusty spanner
she said: "Eh, I know you, and you cannot sing"
I said: "that's nothing -you should hear me play piano"
We can go for a walk where it's quiet and dry
and we can talk about precious things
but when you are tied to your mother's apron
not one talks about castration
We can go for a walk where it's quiet and dry
and we can talk about precious things
like love and law and poverty
these are the things that kill me
We can go for a walk where it's quiet and dry
and we can talk about precious things
but the rain that flattens my hair
theses are the things that kill me
Passed the Pub that saps your body
and the church who'll snatch your money
the Queen is dead, boys
and it's so lonely on a limb
Pass the Pub that wrecks your body
and the church-all they want is your money
the Queen is dead, boys`
you can trust me, boys
life is very long, when you're lonely
life is very long, when you're lonely...

 

FRANKLY MR.SHANKLY

Frankly, Mr Shankly, this position Ive held
it pays my way, but it corrodes my soul
I want to leave you will not miss me
I want to go down in musical history
Frankly, Mr Shankly, Im a sickening wreck
Ive got the 21st Century breathing down my neck
I must move fast, you understand me
I want to go down in celluloid history
Fame, Fame, fatal Fame
it can play hideous tricks on the brain
but still I rather be Famous
than righteous or holy, any day
but sometimes Id feel more fulfilled
making Christmas cards with the mentally ill
I want to Live and I want to Love
I want to catch something that I might be ashamed of
Frankly, Mr Shankly, this position I've held
it pays my way and it corrodes my soul
oh, I didnt realise that you wrote poetry
(I didnt realise you wrote such bloody awful poetry)
Frankly, Mr Shankly, since you ask
you are a flatulent pain the arse
I do not mean to be so rude
but still, I must speck frankly, Mr Shankly

 

I KNOW IT'S ALL OVER

Oh Mother, I can fell the soil falling over my head
and as i climb into an empty bed
Oh well, Enough said
I know it's over-still I cling
I don't know where else I can go
Oh Mother, I can feel the soil falling over my head
see, the sea want s to take me
the knife wants to cut me
do you think you can help me?
Sad veiled bride, please be happy
handsome groom, give her room
loud, loutish lover, treat her kindly
(although she needs you
more than she loves you)
and I know it's over
and it never really began
but in my heart it was so real
and you even spoke to me and said:
"If you're so funny
then why are you on your own tonight?
and if you are so clever
then why are you on your own tonight?
if you're so terribly good looking
then why do you sleep alone tonight?
because tonight is just like any other night
that's why you're on your own tonight
with your triumphs and your charms
while they are in each other's arms.."
It's so easy to laugh
it's so easy to hate
it takes strength to be gentle and kind
It's so easy to laugh
it's so easy to hate
it takes guts to be gentle and kind
love is Natural and Real
but not for you, my love
not tonight my love
love is Natural and Real
but not for such as you and I, my love
Oh Mother, I can fell the soil falling over my head
Oh Mother, I can fell the soil falling over my head...

 

NEVER HAD NO ONE EVER

When you walk without ease
on these
the very streets where you were raised
I had a really bad dream
it lasted 20 years, 7 months, and 27 days
Never had no one ever.

 

CEMETERY GATES

A dreaded sunny day
so I meet you at the cemetry gates
Keats and Yeats are on your side
A dreaded sunny day
so I meet you at the cemetry gates
Keats and Yeats are on your side
while Wilde is on mine
So we go inside and we gravely read the stones
all those people all those lives
where are they now ?
with loves, and hates
and passions just like mine
they were born
and then they lived and then they died
which seems so unfair
and I wantr to crv
You say: "ere thrice the sun hath done salutation to the dawn"
and you claim these words as your own
but Im well-read, have heard them said
a hundred times (maybe less, maybe more)
if you must write prose/poems
the words you use should be your own
dont plagiarise or take "on loans"
there's alweays someone, somewhere
with a big nose, who knows
and who trips you up and laughs
when you fall
You say: "ere long done do does did "
words which could only be your own
you then produce the text
from whence was ripped
(some dizzy whore, 1804)
A dreaded sunny day
so let's go where we're happy
so I meet you at the cemetry gates
Keats and Yeats are on your side
A dreaded sunny day
so let's go where we're wanted
so I meet you at the cemetry gates
Keats and Yeats are on your side
but you lose
because Wilde is on mine

 

BIGMOUTH STRIKES AGAIN

Sweetness, sweetness I was only joking
when I said Id like to smash every tooth
in your head
Sweetness, sweetness I was only joking
when I said by right s you should be
bludgeoned in your bed
and now I know how Joan of Arc felt
now I know how Joan of Arc felt
as the flames roseto her roman nose
and her Walkman stared to melt
Bibmouth, bigmouth
bigmouth strikes again
and Ive got no right to take my place
with the Human race
and now I know how Joan of Arc felt
now I know of Joan of Arc felt
as the flames rose to her roman nose
and her hearing aid started to melt
Bigmouth, bigmouth
bigmouth strikes again
and Ive got no right to take my place
with the Human race

 

THE BOY WITH A THORN IN HIS SIDE

The boy with the thorn in his side
behind the hatred there lies
a murderous desire for love
how can they look into my eyes
and still they dont believe me
how can they hear me say those words
and still they dont believe me
and if they don't believe me now
will they ever believe me?
and if they don't believe me now
will they ever believe me?
The boy with the thorn in his side
behind the hatred there lies
a plundering desire for love
how can they see the Love in our eyes
and still they don't believe us
and after all this time
they don't want to believe us
and if they dont believe us now
will they ever believe us ?
andd when you want to Live
how do you start ?
where do you go ?
who do you know?

 

VICAR IN A TUTU

I was minding mind business
lifting some lead off
the roof of the Holy Name church
it was worthwhile living a laughable life
just to set my eyes on a blistering sight
of a vicar in a tu-tu
he's not strange
he just wants to live his life this way
a scanty bit of a thing
with a decorative ring
that wouldn't cover the head of a child
as Rose collects the money in the cannister
who comes sliding down the bannister
the vicar in a tu-tu
he's not strange
he just wants to live his life this way
the monkish monsignor
with a head full of plaster
said "my man, get your vile soul dry-cleaned"
as Rose counts the money in the cannister
as natural as rain
he dances again
vicar in a tu-tu
The next day in the pulpit
with Freedom and Ease
combating ignoranca,dust and disease
as Rose counts the money in the cannister
as natural as rain
he dances again
the fabric of a tu-tu
any man could get us to
and I am a living sign.

 

THERE IS A LIGHT THAT NEVER GOES OUT

Take me out tonight
where there's music and there's people
who are young and alive
driving in your car
I never never want to go home
because I havent got one
anymore
take me out tonight
because I want to see people and I
want to see lights
driving in your car
oh please dont drop me home
because it's not my home, it's their
home, and Im welcome no morw
and if a double-decker bus
crashes in to us
to die by your side
such a heavenly way to die
and if a ten ton truck
kills the both of us
to die by your side
the pleasure and the privilege is mine
take me out tonight
oh take me anywhere, I dont care
and in the darken underpass
I thought Oh God, my chance has come at last
(but then a strange fear gripped me and I just couldn't ask)
take me out tonight
take me anywhere, I dont care
just driving in your car
I never never want to go home
because I havent got one
I havent got one.

 

SOME GIRLS ARE BIGGER THAN OTHERS

From the ice-age to the dole-age
there is but one concern
and I have just discover
some girls are bigger than others
some girls are bigger than others
some girls mothers are bigger than
other girls mothers
As Anthony said to Cleopatra
as he opened a crate of ale:
some girls are bigger than others
some girls are bigger than others
some girls mothers are bigger than
other girls mothers.

 

A RUSH AND A PUSH AND AND THE LAND IS OURS

HELLO
I am the ghost of Troubled Joe
hung by his pretty white neck
some eighteen months ago
I travelled to a mystical time zone
but I missed my bed
so I soon came home
they said:
"there's too much caffeine
in your bloodstream
and a lack of real spice
in your life"
I said:
"leave me alone
because I'm alright, dad
just surprised to still
be on my own...."
Ooh, but don't mention love
I'd hate the real strain of the pain again
a rush and a push and the land that
we stand on is ours
it has been before
so it shall be again
and people who are uglier than you and I
they take what they need, and leave
Ooh, but don't mention love
I'd hate the pain and the strain all over again
a rush and a push and the land that
we stand on is ours
it has been before
so why can't it be now?
and people who are weaker than you and I
they take what they want from life
Ooh, but don't mention love
no - just don't mention love!
a rush and a push and the land that
we stand on is ours
your youth may be gone
but you're still a young man
so phone me, phone me, phone me
so phone me, phone me, phone me
Ooh, I think I'm in love...
Urrgh, I think I'm in lerv

 

I STARTED SOMETHING I COULDN'T FINISH

The lanes were silent
with nothing or no one around for miles
I doused our friendly venture
with a hard-faced
three-word gesture
I started something
I forced you into a zone
and you were clearly
never meant to go
hair brushed and parted
typical me, typical me, typical me
I started something
...and now I'm not too sure
I grabbed you by the guilded beams
that's what Tradition means
and I doused another venture
with a gesture
that was...absolutely vile
I started something
forced you to a zone
and you were clearly
never meant to go
hair brushed and parted
typical me, typical me, typical me
I started something
...and now I'm not too sure
I grabbed you by the guilded beams
that's what Tradition means
and now eighteen months' hard-labour
seems...fair enough

DEATH OF A DISCO DANCER

The death of a disco dancer
well, it happens a lot 'round here
and if you think Peace
is a common goal
well, that goes to show
just how little you know
The death of a disco dancer
well, I'd rather not get involved
I never talk to my neighbour
I'd just rather not get involved
Love, peace and harmony?
Love, peace and harmony?
Oh, very nice, very nice, very nice, very nice
...but maybe in the next world.

 

GIRLFRIEND IN A COMA

Girlfriend in a coma, I know
I know - it's serious
Girlfriend in a coma, I know
I know - it's really serious
there wree times when I could
have 'murdered' her
(but, you know, I would hate
anything to happen to her)
NO, I DON'T WANT TO SEE HER
Do you really think
she'll pull through?
Do you really think
she'll pull through?
Girlfriend in a coma, I know
I know, it's serious

WOULD YOU PLEASE LET ME SEE HER!
Do you really think she'll pull through?

Let me wisper my last goodbyes
I know - IT'S SERIOUS

 

STOP ME IF YOU'VE HEARD THIS ONE BEFORE

Stop me, stop me,
stop me if you think that you've heard this one before
stop me, stop me
stop me if you think that you've heard this one before
nothing's changed
I still love you, oh I still love you
...only slightly less than I used to
I was delayed, I was way-laid
an emergency stop
I smelt the last ten seconds of life
I crashed down on the crossbar
and the pain was enough to make
a shy, bald buddhist reflect
and plan a mass-murder
who said I'd lied to her?
who said I'd lied because I never
who said I'd lied because I never
I was detained, I was restrained
he broke my spleen
he broke my knees
(and then he really laid into me)
Friday night in Out-patients
who said I'd lied to her?
who said I'd lied - because I never
who said I'd lied - because I never
Oh, so I drank one
or was it four
and when I fell on the floor
...I drank more
stop me, stop me
stop me if you think that you've heard this one before
nothing's changed
I still love you, I still love you
but only slightly
less than I used to

 

LAST NIGHT I DREAMT THAT SOMEBODY LOVED ME

Last night I dreamt
that somebody loved me
no hope - but no harm
just another false alarm
Las night I felt
real arms around me
no hope - no harm
just another false alarm
so, tell me how long
before the last one?
and tell me how long
before the right one?
this story is old - I KNOW
but it goes on

UNHAPPY BIRTHDAY

I've come to wish you an unhappy birthday
I've come to wish you an unhappy birthday
because you're evil
and you lie
and if you should die
I may feel slightly sad
(but I won't cry)
Loved and lost
and some may say
when usually its Nothing
surely you're happy
it should be this way?
I say "No, I'm gonna kill my dog"
and: "May the lines sag heavy
and deep tonight XXX"

Loved and lost
some people say
when usually its Nothing
surely you're happy

I said "No"
and then I shot myself
so, drink, drink, drink
and be ill tonight
from the one you left behind
from the one you left behind...

 

PAINT A VULGAR PICTURE

At the record company meeting
On their hands - a dead star
and ooh, the plans that they weave
and ooh, the sikening greed
At the record company meeting
on their hands - a dead star
the sycophantic slags all say:
"I knew him first, and I knew him well"
Re-issue! Re-package! Re-package!
Re-evaluate the songs
double-pack with a photograph
Extra Track (and a tacky badge)
A-list, playlist
"Please them, please them!"
"Please them! Please them!"
(sadly, THIS was your life)
but you could have said no
if you'd wanted to
you could have said no
if you'd wanted to
BPI, MTV, BBC
"Please them! Please them!"
(sadly this was your life)
but you could have said no
if you'd wanted to
you could have walked away
...couldn't you?
I touched you at the soundcheck
you had no real way of knowing
in my heart I bgged "please, take
me with you...
I don't care where you're going"
But to you I was faceless
I was fawning, I was boring
just a child from those ugly new houses
who could never begin to know
who could never really know
Best of? Most of?
Satiate the need
slip them into different sleeves!
Buy both, and be decieved
climber - new entry, re-entry
World tour! ("media whore")
"Please the Press in Belgium!"
(THIS was your life...)
and when it fails to recoup?
Well, maybe:
You just haven't earned it yet, baby
I walked a pace behind you at the soundcheck
you're just the same as I am
what makes most people feel happy
leads us headlong into harm
so, in my bedroom in those 'ugly new houses'
I dance my legs down to the knees
but me and my 'true love'
we will never meet again...
At the record company meeting
on their hands - at last! - a dead star!
but they cannot taint you in my eyes
no, they cannout touch you now
No, they cannot hurt you my darling
they cannot touch you now
but me and my 'true love'
will never meet again

 

DEATH AT ONE'S ELBOW

Ooh Glenn, don't come to the house tonight
Ooh, Glenn, don't come to the house tonight
because there's somebody here
who really really loves you
stay home
be bored
(it's crap, I KNOW)
Ooh, Glenn, don't come to the house tonight
Ooh, Glen, don't come to the house tonight
because there's somebody here
who'll take a hatchet to your ear
how the frustration renders me
hateful, Glenn!
don't come to the house tonight
don't come to the house tonight
because you'll slip on the
trail of my bespattered remains
and so, that's why
GOODBYE MY LOVE, GOODBYE MY LOVE, GOODBYE MY LOVE...
Belch

 

I WON'T SHARE YOU

I won't share you
I won't share you
with the drive and ambition
and the zeal I feel
this is my time
as the note I wrote
was read, she said
has the Perrier gone
straight to my head
or is life plainly sick and cruel, instead?
"YES!"
No-no-no-no-no-no
I won't share you
I won't share you
with the drive and the dreams inside
this is my time
Life tends to come and go
well, that's OK
just as long as you know
Life tends to come and go
well, that's OK
just as long as you know
I won't share you
I won't share you
with the drive and the dreams inside
this is my time, this is my time


THE QUEEN IS DEAD

Farewell to this lands cheerless marches
hemmed in like a boar between arches
her very Lowness with her head in a sling
Im truely sorry-but it sounds like a wonderful thing
dear Charles, dont you ever crave
to appear on the front of the Daily mail
dressed in your Mother's bridal veil?
So, I checked all the registered historical facts
and I was shocked into shame to discover
how Im the 18th pale descendent
of some, old queen or other
has the world changed, or have I changed?
has the world changed, or have I changed?
as some 9-year old tough peddles drugs
(I never even knew what drugs were)
And so, I broke into the Palace
with a sponge and a rusty spanner
she said: "Eh, I know you, and you cannot sing"
I said: "that's nothing -you should hear me play piano"
We can go for a walk where it's quiet and dry
and we can talk about precious things
but when you are tied to your mother's apron
not one talks about castration
We can go for a walk where it's quiet and dry
and we can talk about precious things
like love and law and poverty
these are the things that kill me
We can go for a walk where it's quiet and dry
and we can talk about precious things
but the rain that flattens my hair
theses are the things that kill me
Passed the Pub that saps your body
and the church who'll snatch your money
the Queen is dead, boys
and it's so lonely on a limb
Pass the Pub that wrecks your body
and the church-all they want is your money
the Queen is dead, boys`
you can trust me, boys
life is very long, when you're lonely
life is very long, when you're lonely...

 

PANIC

Panic on the streets of London
Panic on the streets of Birmingham
I wonder to myself
Could life ever be sane again
on the Leeds side-streets that you slip down
I wonder to myself
Hopes may rise on the Grasmeres
But Honey Pie, you're not safe here
So you run down
To the safety of the town
But there's Panic on the streets of Carlisle
Dublin, Dundee, Humberside
I wonder to myself
Burn down the Disco
Hang the blessed D.J.
Because the music that they constantly play
IT SAYS NOTHING TO ME ABOUT MY LIFE
Hang the blessed D.J.
Because the music they constantly play
On the Leeds side-streets that you slip down
On the provincial towns that you jog 'round
Hang the D.J.,. Hang the D.J.,.Hang the D.J...

 

VICAR IN A TUTU

I was minding mind business
lifting some lead off
the roof of the Holy Name church
it was worthwhile living a laughable life
just to set my eyes on a blistering sight
of a vicar in a tu-tu
he's not strange
he just wants to live his life this way
a scanty bit of a thing
with a decorative ring
that wouldn't cover the head of a child
as Rose collects the money in the cannister
who comes sliding down the bannister
the vicar in a tu-tu
he's not strange
he just wants to live his life this way
the monkish monsignor
with a head full of plaster
said "my man, get your vile soul dry-cleaned"
as Rose counts the money in the cannister
as natural as rain
he dances again
vicar in a tu-tu
The next day in the pulpit
with Freedom and Ease
combating ignoranca,dust and disease
as Rose counts the money in the cannister
as natural as rain
he dances again
the fabric of a tu-tu
any man could get us to
and I am a living sign.

 

ASK

Shyness is nice, but
Shyness can stop you
From doing all the things in life
That you'd like to
So, if there's something you'd like to try
ASK ME-I WON'T SAY "NO"-HOW COULD I?
Coyness is nice, but ,
Coyness can stop you
from saying all the things in
life that you want to
If there's something that you'd like to try
ASK ME-I WON'TSAY"NO"-HOW COULD I?
Spending warm, Summer days indoors
Writing fringhtening verse
To a buck-toothed girl in Luxembourg
ASK ME, ASK ME ,ASK ME, ASK ME, ASK ME ,ASK ME
Because if it's not Love
Then it's the Bomb
That will bring us together
Nature is a language-can't you read?
Nature is a language-can't you read?
ASK ME, ASK ME ,ASK ME, ASK ME, ASK ME ,ASK ME
Because if it's not Love
Then it's the Bomb
That will bring us together

 

MARIE'S THE NAME (HIS LATEST FLAME) / RUSHOLME RUFFIANS

Very old friend 
Came by today 
As he was telling everyone in town 
Of all the love that he'd just found 
And Marie's the name (of his latest flame) 
Talked and talked 
And I heard him say 
That she had the longest blackest hair 
Prettiest green eyes anywhere 
And Marie's the name (of his latest flame) 
The last night of the fair 
By the big wheel generator 
A boy is stabbed 
His money is grabbed 
And the air hangs heavy like a dulling wine 
She is Famous 
She is Funny 
An engagement ring 
Doesn't mean a thing 
To a mind consumed by brass (money), oh 
The last night of the fair 
From a seat on a whirling waltzer 
Her skirt ascends for a watching eye 
It's a hideous trait (on her mother's side)
From a seat on a whirling waltzer 
Her skirt ascends for a watching eye 
A hideous trait (on her mother's side) 
Then someone falls in love 
Someone's beaten up 
Someone's beaten up 
And the senses being dulled are mine 
And someone falls in love 
Someone's beaten up 
And the senses being dulled are mine 
This is the last night of the fair 
And the grease in the hair 
Of a speedway operator 
Is all a tremulous heart requires 
A schoolgirl is denied 
She said : "How quickly would I die 
If I jumped from the top of the parachutes ?"
This is the last night of the fair 
And the grease in the hair 
Of a speedway operator 
Is all a tremulous heart requires 
A schoolgirl is denied 
She said : "How quickly would I die 
Oh, if I jumped from the top of the parachutes ?"
...Oh, walk home alone 
I might walk home alone 
But my faith in love is still devout

 

THE BOY WITH THE THORN IN HIS SIDE

The boy with the thorn in his side
behind the hatred there lies
a murderous desire for love
how can they look into my eyes
and still they dont believe me
how can they hear me say those words
and still they dont believe me
and if they don't believe me now
will they ever believe me?
and if they don't believe me now
will they ever believe me?
The boy with the thorn in his side
behind the hatred there lies
a plundering desire for love
how can they see the Love in our eyes
and still they don't believe us
and after all this time
they don't want to believe us
and if they dont believe us now
will they ever believe us ?
andd when you want to Live
how do you start ?
where do you go ?
who do you know?

 

RUBBER RING / WHAT SHE SAID

Yeah! What she says : 
"How come someone hasn't noticed 
That I'm dead 
And decided to bury me ? 
God knows, I'm ready !"
La-la-la ... 
What she said was sad 
But then, all the rejection she's had 
To pretend to be happy 
Could only be idiocy 
La-la-la ... 
What she said was not for the job or 
Lover that she never had 
No no no ... 
What she read 
All heady books 
She'd sit and prophesise 
(It took a tattooed boy from 
Birkenhead 
To really really open her eyes)

IS IT REALLY SO STRANGE?

I left the North 
I travelled South 
I found a tiny house 
And I can't help the way I feel 
Oh yes, you can kick me 
And you can punch me 
And you can break my face 
But you won't change the way I feel 
'Cause I love you, Oh ... 
And is it really so strange ? 
Oh, is it really so strange ? 
Oh, is it really so, really so strange ? 
I say NO, you say YES 
(and you will change your mind) 
I left the South 
I travelled North 
I got confused - I killed a horse 
I can't help the way I feel 
Oh yes, you can punch me 
And you can butt me 
And you can break my spine 
But you won't change the way I feel 
'Cause I love you, Oh ... 
And is it really so strange ? 
Oh, is it really so strange ? 
Oh, is it really so, really so strange ? 
I say NO, you say YES 
(But you will change your mind) 
I left the North again 
I travelled South again 
And I got confused - I killed a nun 
I CAN'T HELP THE WAY I FEEL 
(I lost my bag in Newport Pagnell) 
Why is the last mile the hardest mile ? 
My throat was dry, with the sun in my eyes 
And I realised, I realised 
I could never 
I could never, never, never, go back home again

 

CEMETERY GATES

A dreaded sunny day
so I meet you at the cemetry gates
Keats and Yeats are on your side
A dreaded sunny day
so I meet you at the cemetry gates
Keats and Yeats are on your side
while Wilde is on mine
So we go inside and we gravely read the stones
all those people all those lives
where are they now ?
with loves, and hates
and passions just like mine
they were born
and then they lived and then they died
which seems so unfair
and I wantr to crv
You say: "ere thrice the sun hath done salutation to the dawn"
and you claim these words as your own
but Im well-read, have heard them said
a hundred times (maybe less, maybe more)
if you must write prose/poems
the words you use should be your own
dont plagiarise or take "on loans"
there's alweays someone, somewhere
with a big nose, who knows
and who trips you up and laughs
when you fall
You say: "ere long done do does did "
words which could only be your own
you then produce the text
from whence was ripped
(some dizzy whore, 1804)
A dreaded sunny day
so let's go where we're happy
so I meet you at the cemetry gates
Keats and Yeats are on your side
A dreaded sunny day
so let's go where we're wanted
so I meet you at the cemetry gates
Keats and Yeats are on your side
but you lose
because Wilde is on mine

 

LONDON

Smoke
Lingers 'round your fingers
Train
Heave on - to Euston
Do you think you've made
The right decision this time?
You left
Your tired family grieving
And you think they're sad because you're leaving
But didn't you see the Jealousy in the eyes
Of the ones who had to stay behind?
And do you think you've made
The right decision thins time?
You left
Your girlfriend on the platform
With thei really ragged notion that you'll return
But she knows
That when he goes
He really goes
So do you think you've made
The right decision this time?

 

I KNOW IT'S OVER

I can feel the soil falling over my head 
And as I climb into an empty bed 
Oh well. Enough said. 
I know it's over - still I cling 
I don't know where else I can go 
Over ... 
Oh Mother, I can feel the soil falling over my head 
See, the sea wants to take me 
The knife wants to cut me 
Do you think you can help me ? 
Sad veiled bride, please be happy 
Handsome groom, give her room 
Loud, loutish lover, treat her kindly 
(Though she needs you 
More than she loves you) 
And I know it's over - still I cling 
I don't know where else I can go 
Over, it's over, it's over, it's over 
It's over, la ... 
I know it's over 
And it never really began 
But in my heart it was so real
And you even spoke to me, and said : 
"If you're so funny 
Then why are you on your own tonight ? 
And if you're so clever 
Then why are you on your own tonight ? 
I know ... 
'Cause tonight - it's just like any other night 
That's why you're on your own tonight 
Your triumphs and your charms 
While they're in each other's arms..."
It's so easy to laugh 
It's so easy to hate 
It takes strength to be gentle and kind 
Over, over, over, over 
It's so easy to laugh 
It's so easy to hate 
It takes guts to be gentle and kind 
Over, over 
Love is Natural and Real 
But not for you, my love 
Not tonight, my love 
Love is Natural and Real 
But not for such as you and I, my love 
Oh Mother, I can feel the soil falling over my head...
Oh Mother, I can feel the soil fall over, fall over my head 
Oh Mother, I can feel the ... fall over my ... , Oh ...

 

THE DRAIZE TRAIN

A vastly superior version of the instrumental B-side, acting as a peace 
offering to Marr (Morrissey chose the tracks for the compilation, 
and of course, receives no royalties on this track).

 

STILL ILL

I decree today that life
is simply taking and not giving
England is mine and it owes me a living
ask me why, and I'll spit in your eye
ask me why, and I'll spit in your eye
but we cannot cling to the old dreams anymore
no, we cannot cling to the old dreams anymore
Does the body rule the mind
or does the mind rule the body?
I dunno...
Under the iron bridge we kissed
and although I ended up with sore lips
it just wasn't like the old days anymore
no, it wasn't like those days
am I still ill?
Does the body rule the mind
or does the mind rule the body ?
I dunno...
Ask me why, and I'll die
ask me why, and I'll die
and if you must go to work tomorrow
well, if I were you I wouldn't bother
for there are brighter sides to life
and I should know because I've seen them
but not very often...
under the iron bridge we kissed
and although I ended up with sore lips
it just wasn't like the old days anymore
no, it wasn't like those days
am I still ill?

 

BIGMOUTH STRIKES AGAIN

Sweetness, sweetness I was only joking
when I said Id like to smash every tooth
in your head
Sweetness, sweetness I was only joking
when I said by right s you should be
bludgeoned in your bed
and now I know how Joan of Arc felt
now I know how Joan of Arc felt
as the flames roseto her roman nose
and her Walkman stared to melt
Bibmouth, bigmouth
bigmouth strikes again
and Ive got no right to take my place
with the Human race
and now I know how Joan of Arc felt
now I know of Joan of Arc felt
as the flames rose to her roman nose
and her hearing aid started to melt
Bigmouth, bigmouth
bigmouth strikes again
and Ive got no right to take my place
with the Human race

 
ALSATIAN COUSTIN

Were you and he Lovers?
and would you say so if you were?
on a forecourt
on a Friday
passing my way
Were you and he Lovers?
and if you were, then say that you were!
on a groundsheet
under canvas
with your tent-flap
open wide
A note upon his desk:
"P.S. Bring Me Home And Have Me!"
Leather elbows on a tweed coat
- Oh! -
Is THAT the best you can do?
So came his reply:
"...but on the desk is where I want you!"
So I ask (even though I know):
were you and he Lovers?

 

LITTLE MAN, WHAT NOW?

An afternoon nostalgia
television show
you spoke in silhouette
(but they couldn't name you)
although the panel were
very polite to you
but I remembered you
from Friday nights 1969
ATV - you murdered every line
too old to be a child star
too young to take leads
four seasons passed
and they AXED you
nervously juvenile
(WON'T SMILE!)
What became of you?
did that swift eclipse torture you?
a star at eighteen
and then-suddenly gone
down to a few lines
in the back page of a teenage annual
oh but I remembered you
I looked up to you

 

EVERYDAY IS LIKE SUNDAY

Trudging slowly over wet sand
back to the bench
where your clothes were stolen
this is the coastal town
that they forgot to close down
Armageddon - come Armageddon!
Come Armageddon! Come!
Everyday is like Sunday
everyday is silent and grey
Hide on the promenade
scratch out a postcard
"how I dearly with I was not here"
in the seaside town
...that they forgot to bomb
Come! Come! Come - nuclear bomb!
Everyday is like Sunday
everyday is silent and grey
Trudging back over pebbles and sand
and a strange dust lands on your hands
(and on your face)
Everyday is like Sunday
"Win Yourself A Cheap Tray"
share some greased tea with me
everyday is silent and grey

 

BENGALI IN PLATFORMS

No no no
he does not want to depress you
oh no no no no no
he only wants to impress you
Bengali in platform
she only wants to embrace your culture
and to be your friend forever
Bengali, Bengali
oh shelve your Western plans
and understand that life is hard enough when you belong here
A silver-studded rim that glistens
and an ankle-star that...blinds me
a lemon sole so very high
which only reminds me, to tell you
so I break the news gently
I break the news to you gently
"Shelve your plans"
Bengali, Bengali
its the touchy march of time
that blinds you
don't blame me
don't hate me
just because I'm the one to tell you
that life is hard enough when you belong here
life is hard enough when you belong here
shelve your western plans
life is hard enough when you belong here

 

ANGEL, ANGEL, DOWN WE GO TOGETHER

Angel, Angel
don't take your life tonight
I know they take
and that they take in turn
and they give you nothing real
for yourself in return
and when they've used you
and they've broken you
and wasted all your money
and cast your shell aside
and when they've bought you
and they've sold you
and they've billed you for the pleasure
and they've made your parents cry
I will be here
BELIEVE ME
I will be here
...believe me
Angel, don't take your life
some people have got no pride
they do not understand
the Urgency of life
but I love you more than life
I love you more than life
I love you more than life
I love you more than life

 

LALE NIGHT, MAUDLIN STREET

The last night on Maudlin Street
goodbye house
goodbye stairs
I was born here
I was raised here, and
...I took some stick here
love at first sight
may sound trite
but it's true, you know
I could list the details
of everything you ever wore
or said, or how you stood that day
and as we spend the last night
on Maudlin Street, I say
"goodbye house-forever!"
I never stole a happy hour
around here
Where the world's ugliest boy
became what you see
here I am - the ugliest man
Its the last night on Maudlin Street
and truly I do love you
oh, truly I do love you
When I sleep with that picture of
you framed beside my bed
oh, it's childish and it's silly
but I think it's you in my room
by the bed (...yes, I told you it was silly...)
and I know
I took strange pills
but I never meant to hurt you
oh truly I love you
I came home late one night
everyone had gone to bed
nobody stays up for you
when you have sixteen stitches
all around your head
the last buss I missed to Maudlin Street
so, he drove me home in the Van
complaining: "Women only like me for my mind..."
don't leave your torch behind
power-cuts ahead
as we crept through the park
but no I cannot steal a pair of jeans
off a clothesline for you
but you...without clothes
oh I could not keep a straight face
me - without clothes?
well a nation turns its back and gags...
I'm packed
I am moving house
a half-life disappears today
every slag waves me on
(secretly wishing me gone
well, I will be soon
oh - I will be soon)
There were bad times on Maudlin Street
when they took you away in a police car
dear Inspector - don't you know?
don't you care?
don't you know - about Love?
Your gran died
and your mother died
on Maudlin Street
in pain and ashamed
with never time to say
those special things
I took the keys from Maudlin Street
well, it's only bricks and mortar!
and...truly I do love you
wherever you are
wherever you are

 

SUEDHEAD

Why do you come here
why do you hang around
I'm so sorry
I'm so sorry
Why do you come here
when you know it makes
things hard for me
when you know, oh
why do you come?
Why do you telephone?
and why send me silly notes?
I'm so sorry
I'm so sorry
why do you come here
when you know it makes
thing hard for me
when you know, oh
why do you come?
You had to sneak into my room
'just' to read my diary
was it just to see all the things
you knew I'd written about you?
and...so many illustrations
I'm so very sickened
oh, I am so sickened NOW

 

BREAK UP THE FAMILY

The strange logic of your clumsiest line
stayed emblazoned on my mind
break up the family
and lets begin to live our lives
I went to see all my friends tonight
it wasn't Youth, it wasn't even Life
born Old, sadly wise
resigned (well, we were)
to ending our lives
I'm so glad to grow older
to move away from those awful times
I want to see all my friends tonight
Yes you found love but you weren't
at peace with your life
home late, full of Hate
despise the ties that bind
oh I'm so glad to grow older
to move away from those younger years
now I'm in love for the first time
and I don't feel bad
Let me see all my old friends
let me put my arm around them
because I really do love them
now, does that sound mad?
Captain of games, solid framed
I stood on the touchline
hailstones, driven home
in his car - no breaks? I don't mind
I'm just so glad to grow older
to move away from those darker years
I'm in love for the first time
and I don't feel bad
so wish me luck my friends
goodbye

 

HAIRDRESSER ON FIRE

Here is London
here is London
is it home of the free,
or what?
can you squeeze me
into an empty page of your diary
and psychologically save me
I've got faith in you
I sense the power
in the fingers
within an hour the power
can totally destroy me
or it could same my life
here is London
'home of the brash, outrageous
and free'
you are repressed
but you're remarkably dressed
is it Real?
but you're far to busy
busy scissors
busy clippers
hair dresser on fire
all around Sloane Square
and you're far too busy
to see me
"busy,busy"
hairdresser on fire
was a client over-cautious
he made you nervous
and when he said
"I'm gonna sue you"
I really felt for you
so can you squeeze me
into an empty page of your diary
and supernaturally change me
CHANGE ME, CHANGE ME

 

THE ORDINARY BOYS

Ordinary boys, happy knowing nothing
happy being no one, but themselves
Ordinary girls, supermarket clothes
who think it's very clever to be cruel to you
for you were so different
you stood all alone
and you knew
that it had to be so
avoiding ordinary boys
happy going nowhere, just around here
in their rattling cars
and ordinary girls
never seeing further
than the cold, small streets
that trap them
but you were so different
you had to say no
when those empty fools
tried to change you, and claim you
for the lair of their ordinary world
where they feel so lucky
so lucky, so lucky
with their lives laid out before them
they're so lucky, so lucky
so lucky, so lucky

 

I DON'T MIND IF YOU FORGET ME

I don't mind
I don't mind if you forget me
having learned my lesson
I never left an impression on anyone
so now you send me your hardened 'regards'
when once you'd send me 'love'
sincerely I must tell you
your mild 'best wishes'
they make me suspicious
but I don't mind
I don't mind if you forget me
having learned my lesson
I never left
an impression on anyone
the pressure to change, to move on
was strange
and very strong
so this is why I tell you
I really do understand
BYE BYE
I don't mind if you forget me
no no no no no no no
REJECTION IS ONE THING
BUT REJECTION FROM A FOOL
IS CRUEL
REJECTION IS ONE THING
BUT REJECTION FROM A FOOL
IS CRUEL
and I don't mind if you forget me
I don't mind if your forget me

 

DIAL-A-CLICHE

Further into the fog I fall
well, I was just
following you!
when you said:
"Do as I do and scrap your fey ways"
(dial-a-cliche)
"grow up, be a man, and close your mealy-mouth!"
(dial-a-cliche)
But the person underneath
where does he go?
does he slide by the wayside?
or...does he just die?
when you find that you've organized
your feelings, for people
who didn't like you then
and certainly don't like you now
yet still you say:
"Do as I do and scrap your fey ways"
(dial-a-cliche)
"grow up, be a man, and close your mealy-mouth!"
(dial-a-cliche)
"the Safe way is the only way!
there's always time to change, son!"
yes well I've changed
but I'm in pain!
dial-a-chiche

 

MARGARET ON THE GUILLOTINE

The kind people
have a wonderful dream
Margaret on the guillotine
because people like you
make me feel so tired
when will you die?
when will you die?
when will you die?
when will you die?
when will you die?
because people like you
make me feel so old inside
please die
and kind people
do not shelter this dream
make it real
make the dream real
make the dream real
make it real

 

OUR FRANK

Our frank and open
deep conversations
they get me nowhere
they bring me down, so
give it a rest, won't you?
give me a cigarette
God give me patience
just no more conversation
Give us a drink
and make it quick
or else I'm gonna be sick
sick all over
your frankly vulgar
red pullover
now see how the colours blend
Our frank and open
deep conversations
they get me nowhere
they bring me down, so
give it a rest, won't you?
now will you just give over
the world may be ending
but look, I'm only human
Give us a drink
and make it quick
or else I'm gonna be sick
all over
your frankly vulgar
red pullover
now see how the two colours blend
Won't somebody stop me
from thinking all the time
about everything
so deeply
so bleakly

 

ASIAN RUT

Day oh so late
strangely the sun still shone
oh Asian boy
what are you on?
Day oh so late
strangely the sun still shone
what drugs are you on?
Tooled-up Asian boy
has come here to avenge
the cruel, cold killing
of his very best friend
Tooled-up Asian boy
has come here to take revenge
for the cruel, cold killing
of his only friend
Peace through the school
so quiet in the hall
it's a strange sign for one
of what's to come
Tough and hard and pale
oh they may just impale you on railings
oh English boys
it must be wrong
three against one?
Brakes slammed, and
a gun jammed, and
as far as I could tell
brave Asian boy
dealt a blow and fell
I'm just passing through here
on my way to somewhere civilised
and maybe I'll even arrive
maybe I'll even arrive?

 

SING YOUR LIFE

Sing your life
any fool can think of words that rhyme
many others do
why don't you?
do you want to?
Sing your life
just walk right up to the microphone
and name
all the things that you love
all the things that you loathe
sing your life
all the things that you love
all the things that you loathe
oh sing your life
oh sing your life
Others sang your life
but now's your chance to shine
and have the pleasure of
saying what you mean
the rare pleasure of
meaning what you sing
oh, make no mistake, my friend
all of this will end
so sing it now
all the things you love
all the things you loathe
oh sing your life
all the things that you love
all the things that you loathe
oh sing your, oh sing your
Don't leave it all unsaid
somewhere in the wasteland of your head
and make no mistake, my friend
your pointless life will end
but before you go
can you look at the truth?
You have a lovely singing voice
a lovely singing voice
and all of those
who sing on key
they stole the notion
from you and me

 

MUTE WITNESS

Your poor witness
crying so loudly on the floor
oh but she's only trying to tell you
what it was that she saw
she is only trying to tell you
what it was that she saw
Now see her standing on the table
with her small arms flailing
and you feel such compassion
in your soul for
Your poor mute witness
still testing the strength
of our patience
oh but she's only trying to tell you
what it was that she saw
Now see her pointing to the frisbee
with a memory too fuzzy
as her silent words
describe the fright of last night
4 a.m. Norhtside, Clapham Common
who knows what she was doing there?
will she sketch the answer later?
Well, I'll ask her
"now dry your tears, my dear"
Now see her mime in time so nicely
it would all have been so clear
is only she had never volunteered
"your taxi is here, my dear"

 

KING LEER

Your boyfriend, he
went down on one knee
well, could it be
he's only got one knee?
I tried to surprise you
with Vodka
or, Tizer
I can't quite remember
but you didn't thank me
you didn't even thank me
because you never do
Your boyfriend, he
has the gift of the gab
or, could it be
the gift of the grab?
I tried to surprise you
I lay down beside you
and...nothing much happened
and you didn't phone me
you didn't even phone me
because it's not your style
to dial
Your boyfriend, he
displays to me
more than just
a hint of cruelty
I tried to surprise you
I crept up behind you
with a homeless chihuahua
you gushed for an hour
you handed him back and said
"You'll never guess
I'm bored now"

 

FOUND FOUND FOUND

found found found found found found
someone who's worth it
in this murkiness
someone who's never
seeming scheming
found found found found found found
someone who's worth it
in this murkiness
someone who's never
seeming scheming
Oh, but if I'd never found
oh, but if I'd never found
oh, but if I'd never found
I do believe that
the more you give your love
and I do believe that
the more you offer trust
the more you chase
the more you cry
the more you're bound to lose
the more you're bound to lose
Oh, but if I'd never found
oh, but if I'd never found
somebody
who wants to be
who wants to be
with me
all the time

 

DRIVING YOUR GIRLFRIEND HOME

I'm driving
your girlfriend home
and she's saying
how she never chose you
"turn left", she says
so I turn left
and she says
"So how did I end up
so deeply involved in
the very existence
I planned on avoiding?"
and I can't answer
I'm driving
your girlfriend home
and she's laughing
to stop herself crying
"drive on", she says
so I drive on
and she says
"So how did I end up
attached to this person
when his sense of humour
gets gradually worser?"
and I can't tell her
I'm parking
outside her home
and we're shaking hands
goodnight, so politely

 

THE HARSH TRUTH OF THE CAMERA EYE

Churchillian legs
hair barely there
the harsh truth of the camera eye
Your eyes signal pain
because of the strain
of smiling
the harsh truth of the camera eye
telling you all
that you never wnated to know
showing what
you didn't want shown
My so friendly lens
zooms into
"the inner you"
and it tells the harsh truth
and nothing but
Laugh with us all here
that's if you can
then take the pictures home
and screamtelling you all
that you never wanted to know
showing you what
you didn't want shown
This photographer
he must have really had it in for you
"Oh, I don't want
to be judged anymore
I don't wnat to be judged
I would sooner be Loved
I would sooner be
just blindly Loved..."

 

(I'M) THE END OF THE FAMILY LINE

With no complications
fifteen generations
(of mine)
all honouring Nature
until I arrive
(with incredible style)
I'm the end fo the line
the end of the family line
the end of the line
No baby pulled screaming
out into this seething whirl
by chance or whim
(or even love?)
our family tree hacked into decline
and I'm spared the pain
of ever saying
("goodbye")
I'm the end of the line
the end of the family line
the end of the line

 

THERE'S A PLACE IN HELL FOR ME AND MY FRIENDS

There is a place
reserved
for me and my friends
and when we go
we all will go
so you see
I'm never alone
there is a place
with a bit more time
and a few more
gentler words
and looking back
we do forgive
(we had no choice
we always did)
all that we hope
is that when we go
our skin
and our blood
and our bones
don't get in your way
making you ill
the way they did
when we lived
There is a place
a place in hell
reserved
for me and my friends
and if ever I
wanted to cry
then I will
because I can

 

TONY THE PONY

Still drinking on the corner 
Just don't say I didn't warn you 
Always nagging big brother 
He's only looking out for you 
Tony The Pony 
Tony The Pony 
You're still standing on the corner 
Just don't say I didn't warn you 
Old and jealous big brother 
You had your time and you spent it 
Crying 
Now, Tony The Pony 
Tony The Pony 
So, that's what they call you now ? 
When you're free outside 
So cold and hard and in control 
And ... 
There's a free ride on 
Tony The Pony 
Oh, why do you always wanna stop me 
From doing the things in life that make me happy ? 
And when I'm outside with friends, laughing loudly 
Why do you always wanna stop me ? 
Oh, I would never 
I would never 
But you will carry the can for anyone 
The free ride on 
Gullible Tony 
You're drunker quicker 
And you're sicker even quicker 
For something heavy is gonna fall on you 
Oh ... 
And what do they call you now ? 
When you're free outside 
So cold and hard and in control 
And, oh ... been a lark 
There's a free ride on 
Fucked-up Tony 
I will never say I told you so 
Or how I knew that something bad 
Would happen to you 
I don't wanna say I told you so 
Oh, but Tony, I told you so !!! 
I told you so

 

YOU'RE GONNA NEED SOMEONE ON YOUR SIDE

With the world's fate 
Resting on your shoulder 
You're gonna need 
Someone on your side 
You can't do it by yourself 
Any longer 
You're gonna need 
Someone on your side 
Someone kindly told me 
That you'd wasted 
Eight of nine lives
Oh, give yourself a break 
Before you break down 
You're gonna need someone on your side 
And here I am, And here I am 
Well, you don't need 
To look so pleased ! 
Day or night, 
There is no difference 
You're gonna need someone on your side 
Day or night, 
There is no difference 
You're gonna need someone soon 
And here I am, And here I am 
Well, you don't need 
To look so pleased

 

GLAMOROUS GLUE

First day with the jar 
You find 
Everyone lies 
First day with the jar 
You find 
Everyone lies, nobody minds 
Everyone lies 
Where is the man you respect ? 
And where is the woman you love ? 
Where's the woman you love ? 
Third week with the jar
You find 
Everything dies 
We won't vote Conservative 
Because we never have 
Everyone lies, everyone lies 
Where is the man you respect ? 
And where is the woman you love ? 
Where's the woman you love ? 
Everything of worth 
On Earth Is there To share 
I used to dream, and I used to vow 
I wouldn't dream of it now 
We look to Los Angeles 
For the language we use 
London is dead, London is dead, London is dead...
Now I'm too much in love 
I'm too much in love 
I know 
I'll go 
Empty hand 
From the land

 

WE'LL LET YOU KNOW

How sad are we ? 
And how sad have we been ? 
We'll let you know 
We'll let you know 
Oh, but only if - you're really interested 
You wonder how 
We've stayed alive 'till now 
We'll let you know 
We'll let you know 
But only if - you're really interested 
We're all smiles 
Then, honest, I swear, it's the turnstiles 
That make us hostile 
Oh ... 
We will descend 
On anyone unable to defend 
Themselves 
Oh ... 
And the songs we sing 
They're not supposed to mean a thing 
La, la, la, la ... 
Oh ...You're lonely, Oh ... you're lonely, Oh ... 
GET OFF THE ROOF ! Oh ... 
Your Arsenal !
We may seem cold, or 
We may even be 
The most depressing people you've ever known 
At heart, what's left, we sadly know 
That we are the last truly British people you'll ever know 
We are the last truly British people you will ever know 
You'll never never want to know

 

THE NATIONAL FRONT DISCO

David, the wind blows 
The wind blows ... 
Bits of your life away 
Your friends all say ... 
"Where is our boy ? Oh, we've lost our boy" 
But they should know 
Where you've gone 
Because again and again you've explained that 
You're going to ... 
Oh, you're going to ... 
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah 
England for the English ! 
England for the English ! 
David, the winds blow 
The winds blow ...
All of my dreams away 
And I still say : 
"Where is our boy ? Ah, we've lost our boy" 
But I should know 
Why you've gone 
Because again and again you've explained
You've gone to the ... 
National, ah ... 
To the National .. 
There's a country; you don't live there 
But one day you would like to 
And if you show them what you're made of 
Oh, then you might do ... 
But David, we wonder 
We wonder if the thunder 
Is ever really gonna begin 
Begin, begin 
Your mom says : 
"I've lost my boy" 
But she should know 
Why you've gone 
Because again and again you've explained 
You've gone to the : 
National 
To the National 
To the National Front Disco 
Because you want the day to come sooner 
You want the day to come sooner 
You want the day to come sooner 
When you've settled the score 
Oh, the National 
Oh, the National

 

CERTAIN PEOPLE I KNOW

I take the cue from 
Certain people I know 
I use the cue 
And then I 
Hand it on to you 
And when I swing it 
So, it catches his eye ... 
(Weren't you there ? 
- You'd have died !) 
I trust the views of 
Certain people I know 
They look at Danger 
And they 
LAUGH THEIR HEADS OFF 
Their clothes are Imitation 
George the 23rd 
(Don't you find this absurd ?) 
I'd hate to be like 
Certain people I know 
They break their necks 
And can't afford to
Get them fixed 
Ah, they'd sacrifice all 
Of their principles for 
anything cashable 
I do believe it's terrible 
Oh, wo, wo, Ah, ah, ah, ah, Oh, wo, wo...

 

WE HATE IT WHEN OUR FRIENDS BECOME SUCCESSFUL

We hate it when our friends become successful 
We hate it when our friends become successful 
Oh, look at those clothes 
Now look at that face, it's so old 
And such a video ! 
Well, it's really laughable 
Ha, ha, ha ...
We hate it when our friends become successful 
And if they're Northern, that makes it even worse
And if we can destroy them 
You bet your life we will 
Destroy them 
If we can hurt them 
Well, we may as well ... 
It's really laughable 
Ha, ha, ha ... 
You see, it should've been me 
It could've been me 
Everybody knows 
Everybody says so 
They say : 
"Ah, you have loads of songs 
So many songs 
More songs than they'd stand 
Verse 
Chorus 
Middle eight 
Break, fade 
Just listen ..."
La, la-la, la-la

SEASICK, YET STILL DOCKED

I am a poor freezingly cold soul 
So far from where 
I intended to go 
Scavenging through life's very constant lulls 
So far from where I'm determined to go 
Wish I knew the way to reach the one I love
There is no way ... 
Wish I had the charm to attract the one I love 
But you see, I've got no charm 
Mmm...
Tonight I've consumed much more than I can hold 
Oh, this is very clear to you 
And you can tell I have never really loved 
You can tell, by the way, I sleep all day
And all of my life no-one gave me anything 
No-one has ever given me anything 
My love is as sharp as a needle in your eye 
You must be such a fool 
To pass me by

 

I KNOW IT'S GONNA HAPPEN SOMEDAY

My love, wherever you are 
Whatever you are 
Don't lose faith 
I know it's gonna happen someday 
To you 
Please wait ... Please wait ... Oh ... Wait ... 
Don't lose faith 
You say that the day just never arrives 
And it's never seemed so far away 
Still, I know it's gonna happen someday 
To you 
Please wait ... 
Don't lose faith

 

TOMORROW

Tomorrow 
Will it really come ? 
And if it does come 
Will I still be Human ? 
All I ask of you is one thing that you never do 
Would you put your arms around me ? 
(I won't tell anyone) 
Tomorrow 
Does it have to come ?
All I ask of you is one thing that you'll never do 
Would you put your arms around me ? 
(I won't tell anybody) 
Tomorrow 
And what must come before ...
Oh, the pain in my arms 
Oh, the pain in my legs 
Ooh, my shiftless body 
Tomorrow 
It's surely nearer now ? 
You don't think I'll make it 
I never said I wanted to ! 
Well did I ? 
Oh, the pain in my arms 
Oh, the pain in my legs 
Oh, yeah; oh, yeah, No, yeah; no, yeah 
Through my shiftless body 
Tomorrow, Tomorrow 
All I ask of you ... oh ... 
Is : would you tell me that you love me 
Tell me, tell me that you love me, Tell me, tell me that you love me ... 
Ah, I know you don't mean it 
Ah, I know you don't mean it 
Tell me, tell me that you love me, Tell me, tell me that you love me ...

(Don't you find this absurd ?) 
I'd hate to be like 
Certain people I know 
They break their necks 
And can't afford to
Get them fixed 
Ah, they'd sacrifice all 
Of their principles for 
anything cashable 
I do believe it's terrible 
Oh, wo, wo Ah, ah, ah, ah Oh, wo, wo...

 

THE NATIONAL FRONT DISCO

David, the wind blows 
The wind blows ... 
Bits of your life away 
Your friends all say ... 
"Where is our boy ? Oh, we've lost our boy" 
But they should know 
Where you've gone 
Because again and again you've explained that 
You're going to ... 
Oh, you're going to ... 
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah 
England for the English ! 
England for the English ! 
David, the winds blow 
The winds blow ...
All of my dreams away 
And I still say : 
"Where is our boy ? Ah, we've lost our boy" 
But I should know 
Why you've gone 
Because again and again you've explained
You've gone to the ... 
National, ah ... To the National .. 
There's a country; you don't live there 
But one day you would like to 
And if you show them what you're made of 
Oh, then you might do ... 
But David, we wonder 
We wonder if the thunder 
Is ever really gonna begin 
Begin, begin 
Your mom says : 
"I've lost my boy" 
But she should know 
Why you've gone 
Because again and again you've explained 
You've gone to the : 
National, To the National 
To the National Front Disco 
Because you want the day to come sooner 
You want the day to come sooner 
You want the day to come sooner 
When you've settled the score 
Oh, the National, Oh, the National…

 

NOVEMBER SPAWNED A MONSTER

Sleep on and dream of Love
because it's the closest you will get to love
poor twisted child, so ugly, so ugly
poor twisted child, oh hug me, oh hug me
one November spawned a monster 
in the shape of this child who later cried
"But Jesus made me, so Jesus save me from
pity, sympathy and people discussing me"
a frame of useless limbs what can make GOOD
all the BAD that's been done?
And if the lights were out
could you even bear
to kiss her full on the mouth (or anywhere?)
poor twisted child, so ugly, so ugly
poor twisted child, oh hug me, oh hug me
one November spawned a monster 
in the shape of this child who must remain
a hostage to kindess and the wheels underneath her
a hostage to kindess and the wheels underneath her
a symbol of where mad, mad lovers
must PAUSE and draw the line
So sleep and dream of love
because it's the closest
you will get to love
that November is a time which I must put OUT of my mind
oh one fine day 
LET IT BE SOON
she won't be rich or beautiful
but she'll be walking your streets
in the clothes that she went out
and chose for herself

 

SEASICK, YET STILL DOCKED

I am a poor freezingly cold soul 
So far from where 
I intended to go 
Scavenging through life's very constant lulls 
So far from where I'm determined to go 
Wish I knew the way to reach the one I love
There is no way ... 
Wish I had the charm to attract the one I love 
But you see, I've got no charm 
Mmm...
Tonight I've consumed much more than I can hold 
Oh, this is very clear to you 
And you can tell I have never really loved 
You can tell, by the way, I sleep all day
And all of my life no-one gave me anything 
No-one has ever given me anything 
My love is as sharp as a needle in your eye 
You must be such a fool 
To pass me by

 

THE LOOP

I just wanna say 
I haven't been away 
I'm still right here 
Where I always was 
So one day, if you're bored 
By all means call 
Because you can do 
(But only if you want to) 
I just wanna say 
I haven't been away 
I am still right here 
Where I always was 
So one day, when you're bored 
By all means call 
Because you can do 
But you might not get through

 

SISTER I'M A POET

All over this town 
Yes, a low wind may blow 
And I can see through everybo... 
With no reason 
To hide these words I feel 
And no reason 
To talk about the books I read 
But still I do 
That's 'cause I'm a ... Sister I'm a ... 
All over this town 
Along this way 
Outside the prison gates 
I love the romance of crime 
And I wonder 
Does anybody feel the way I do ? 
And is evil just something you are 
Or something you do ? 
Sister I'm a ... Sister I'm a ... 
All over this town, All over this town 
They pull over 
In their Citroen vans 
Not to shake your hand 
With meths on their breaths 
And you with youth on your side 
A plastic bag stranded at the lights 
This once was me ...
But now I'm a ... Sister I'm a ...
All over this town ... Oh, oh, oh 
All over this town, All over this town, Oh ... 
I still cannot speak French ... I am very lazy

 

JACK THE RIPPER

Oh, you look so tired 
Mouth slack and wide 
Ill-housed and ill-advised 
Your face is as mean 
As your life has been 
Crash into my arms 
I WANT YOU 
You don't agree -
But you don't refuse 
I know you 
And I know a place 
Where no one is likely to pass 
Oh, you don't care if it's late 
And you don't care if you're lost 
And oh, you look so tired 
(But tonight you presumed too much) 
Too much, too much 
And if it's the last 
Thing I ever do 
I'M GONNA GET YOU 
Crash into my arms 
I WANT YOU 
You don't agree -
But you don't refuse 
I know you 
And no one knows a thing about my life 
I can come and go as I please 
And if I want to, I can stay 
Oh, or if I want to, I can leave 
Nobody knows me, Nobody knows me, Nobody knows me Oh, oh...

 

SUCH A LITTLE THING MAKES SUCH A BIG DIFFERENCE

Such a little thing, such a little thing
but the difference it made was grave
there you go
wielding a bicycle chain
oh why won't you change
cange and be nicer?
such a little thing
a gentle tone of kindness
or written words on paper
- can you write?
How I love all of
the very simple things of life
(God's good air)
how I love all of
the very simple things of life
such a little thing
a fumbling politeness
the difference it saved me
wielding a bicycle chain
"I WILL NOT CHANGE AND I WILL NOT BE NICE"
Most people keep their brains between your legs (don't you find?)
Leave me alone - I was only singing, leave me alone because
I was only singing
leave me alone - I was only singing, leave me alone
you have just proved (again)
MOST PEOPLE KEEP THEIR BRAINS BETWEEN THEIR LEGS

 

I KNOW IT'S GONNA HAPPEN SOMEDAY

My love, wherever you are 
Whatever you are 
Don't lose faith 
I know it's gonna happen someday 
To you 
Please wait ... 
Please wait ... 
Oh ... Wait ... 
Don't lose faith 
You say that the day just never arrives 
And it's never seemed so far away 
Still, I know it's gonna happen someday 
To you 
Please wait ... 
Don't lose faith

 

WE'LL LET YOU KNOW

How sad are we ? 
And how sad have we been ? 
We'll let you know, We'll let you know 
Oh, but only if - you're really interested 
You wonder how 
We've stayed alive 'till now 
We'll let you know, We'll let you know 
But only if - you're really interested 
We're all smiles 
Then, honest, I swear, it's the turnstiles 
That make us hostile 
Oh ... We will descend 
On anyone unable to defend 
Themselves 
Oh ... And the songs we sing 
They're not supposed to mean a thing 
La, la, la, la ... Oh ...
You're lonely, Oh ... you're lonely 
Oh ... 
GET OFF THE ROOF !
Oh ... Your Arsenal !
We may seem cold, or 
We may even be 
The most depressing people you've ever known 
At heart, what's left, we sadly know 
That we are the last truly British people you'll ever know 
We are the last truly British people you will ever know 
You'll never never want to know

 

SUEDHEAD

Why do you come here
why do you hang around
I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry
Why do you come here
when you know it makes
things hard for me
when you know, oh
why do you come?
Why do you telephone?
and why send me silly notes?
I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry
why do you come here
when you know it makes
thing hard for me
when you know, oh
why do you come?
You had to sneak into my room
'just' to read my diary
was it just to see all the things
you knew I'd written about you?
and...so many illustrations
I'm so very sickened
oh, I am so sickened NOW

 

HE KNOWS I'D LOVE TO SEE HIM

He Knows (he knows)
Or, I think he does
because when I lived
in the Arse of the world...
he knows, he knows, he knows I'd love
to see him happy (or as close as is allowed)
because when I lived
in the Arse of the world
he knows, he knows, he knows I'd love
to see him happy (or as close as possible
as close as possible, as close as is allowed)
My name still conjours up deadly deeds
and a bad taste in the mouth
the police - they actually knew me
they said:
"You're just another person in the world
you're just another fool with radical views
you're just another who has maddening views
you want to turn it on its head
by staying in bed!"
I said: "I know I do"

 

YOU'RE GONNA NEED SOMEONE ON YOUR SIDE

With the world's fate 
Resting on your shoulder 
You're gonna need 
Someone on your side 
You can't do it by yourself 
Any longer 
You're gonna need 
Someone on your side 
Someone kindly told me 
That you'd wasted 
Eight of nine lives
Oh, give yourself a break 
Before you break down 
You're gonna need someone on your side 
And here I am, And here I am 
Well, you don't need 
To look so pleased ! 
Day or night, 
There is no difference 
You're gonna need someone on your side 
Day or night, 
There is no difference 
You're gonna need someone soon 
And here I am, And here I am 
Well, you don't need 
To look so pleased

 

GLAMOROUS GLUE

First day with the jar 
You find 
Everyone lies 
First day with the jar 
You find 
Everyone lies, nobody minds, Everyone lies 
Where is the man you respect ? 
And where is the woman you love ? 
Where's the woman you love ? 
Third week with the jar
You find 
Everything dies 
We won't vote Conservative 
Because we never have 
Everyone lies, everyone lies 
Where is the man you respect ? 
And where is the woman you love ? 
Where's the woman you love ? 
Everything of worth 
On Earth, Is there, To share 
I used to dream, and I used to vow 
I wouldn't dream of it now 
We look to Los Angeles 
For the language we use 
London is dead, London is dead, London is dead, ...
Now I'm too much in love 
I'm too much in love, 
I know I'll go 
Empty hand 
From the land

 

WE HATE IT WHEN OUR FRIENDS BECOME SUCCESSFUL

We hate it when our friends become successful 
We hate it when our friends become successful 
Oh, look at those clothes 
Now look at that face, it's so old 
And such a video ! 
Well, it's really laughable 
Ha, ha, ha ...
We hate it when our friends become successful 
And if they're Northern, that makes it even worse
And if we can destroy them 
You bet your life we will 
Destroy them 
If we can hurt them 
Well, we may as well ... 
It's really laughable 
Ha, ha, ha ... 
You see, it should've been me 
It could've been me 
Everybody knows 
Everybody says so 
They say : 
"Ah, you have loads of songs 
So many songs 
More songs than they'd stand 
Verse 
Chorus 
Middle eight 
Break, fade 
Just listen ..."
La, la-la, la-la

 

NOW MY HEART IS FULL

There's gonna be some trouble 
A whole house will need re-building 
And everyone I love in the house 
Will recline on an analyst's couch quite 
Soon 
Your Father cracks a joke 
And in the usual way 
Empties the room 
Tell all of my friends 
(I don't have too many 
Just some rain-coated lovers' puny brothers)
Dallow, Spicer, Pinkie, Cubitt 
Rush to danger 
Wind up nowhere 
Patric Doonan - raised to wait 
I'm tired again, I've tried again, and 
Now my heart is full 
Now my heart is full 
And I just can't explain 
So I won't even try to
Dallow, Spicer, Pinkie, Cubitt 
Every jammy Stressford poet 
Loafing oafs in all-night chemists 
Loafing oafs in all-night chemists 
Underact - express depression 
Ah, but Bunnie I loved you 
I was tired again 
I've tried again, and 
Now my heart is full 
Now my heart is full 
And I just can't explain 
So I won't even try to 
Could you pass by ? 
Could you pass by ? 
Oh ... 
Now my heart is full 
Now my heart is full 
And I just can't explain 
So ... slow ... 
Slow ... slow ... slow ... slow ... slow ...

 

SPRING-HEELED JIM

Spring-heeled Jim winks an eye 
He'll "do", he'll never be "done to" 
He takes on whoever flew through 
"Well, it's the normal thing to do" ... ah ... 
Spring-heeled Jim lives to love 
Now kissing with his mouth full 
And his eyes on some other fool 
So many women 
His head should be spinning 
Ah, but no ! 
Ah, but no ! 
But no !
Ah, no !
Spring-heeled Jim slurs the words : 
"There's no need to be so knowing
Take life at five times the 
Average speed, like I do" 
Until Jim feels the chill 
"Oh, where did all the time go ?" 
Once always in for the kill 
Now it's too cold 
And he feels too 
old 
Too old
Mmm, old... 
La, la, la, la-la, la ...

 

BILLY BUDD

Say, Billy Budd 
So you think you should ? 
Oh, everyone's laughing 
Say, Billy Budd 
So you think that you should ? 
Everyone's laughing ! 
Since I took up with you 
Things have been bad 
Yeah, but now it's 12 years on 
Now it's 12 years on 
Yes, and I took up with you 
I took my job application 
Into town 
Did you hear ? They turned me down 
Yes, and it's all because of us 
Oh, and what was in our eyes 
Oh, what was in our eyes, yeah 
I said, Billy Budd 
I would happily lose 
Both of my legs 
I would lose both of my legs 
Oh, if it meant you could be free 
Oh, if it meant you could be free 
(Don't leave us in the dark!)

 

HOLD ON TO YOUR FRIENDS

A bond of trust 
Has been abused 
Something of value 
May be lost 
Give up your job 
Squander your cash - be rash 
Just hold on to your friends 
There are more than enough 
To fight and oppose 
Why waste good time 
Fighting the people you like 
Who will fall defending your name 
Oh, don't feel so ashamed 
To have friends 
But now you only call me 
When you're feeling depressed 
When you feel happy I'm 
So far from your mind 
My patience is stretched 
My loyalty vexed 
Oh, you're losing all of your friends 
Hold on to your friends 
Hold on to your friends 
Resist - or move on 
Be mad, be rash 
Smoke and explode 
Sell all of your clothes 
Just bear in mind : 
Oh, there just might come a time 
When you need some friends

 

THE MORE YOU IGNORE ME, THE CLOSER I GET

The more you ignore me 
The closer I get 
You're wasting your time 
The more you ignore me 
The closer I get 
You're wasting your time 
I will be 
In the bar 
With my head 
On the bar 
I am now 
A central part 
Of your mind's landscape 
Whether you care 
Or do not 
Yeah, I've made up your mind 
The more you ignore me 
The closer I get 
You're wasting your time 
The more you ignore me 
The closer I get 
You're wasting your time 
Beware !
I bear more grudges 
Than lonely high court judges 
When you sleep 
I will creep 
Into your thoughts 
Like a bad debt 
That you can't pay 
Take the easy way 
And give in 
Yeah, and let me in 
Oh, let me in 
Oh let me ... 
Oh, let me in 
IT'S WAR 
IT'S WAR 
WAR 
WAR 
Oh, let me in 
Ah, the closer I get 
Ah, you're asking for it 
Ah, the closer I get 
Ooh, the closer I ...

 

WHY DON'T YOU FIND OUT FOR YOURSELF

The sanest days are mad 
Why don't you find out for yourself ? 
Then you'll see the price 
Very closely 
Some men here 
They have a special interest 
In your career 
They wanna help you to grow 
And then syphon all your dough 
Why don't you find out for yourself ? 
Then you'll see the glass 
Hidden in the grass 
You'll never believe me, so 
Why don't you find out for yourself ? 
Sick down to my heart 
That's just the way it goes 
Some men here 
They know the full extent of 
Your distress 
They kneel and pray 
And they say : 
"Long may it last" 
Why don't you find out for yourself ?
Then you'll see the glass 
Hidden in the grass 
Bad scenes come and go 
For which you must allow 
Sick down to my heart 
That's just the way it goes 
Don't rake up my mistakes 
I know exactly what they are 
And ... what do YOU do ? 
Well ... you just SIT THERE 
I've been stabbed in the back 
So many many times 
I don't have any skin 
But that's just the way it goes

 

I AM HATED FOR LOVING

I am hated for loving 
I am hated for loving 
Anonymous call, a poison pen 
A brick in the small of the back again 
I still don't belong 
To anyone - I am mine 
And I am hated for loving 
I am haunted for wanting 
Anonymous call, a poison pen 
A brick in the ... ah ... 
A brick in the small of the back again 
I still don't belong 
To anyone - I am mine 
I am falling 
With no-one to catch me 
I am falling 
And there's still 
No-one to catch me 
Ah .. 
Anonymous call, a poison pen 
A brick in the ... ah ... 
A brick in the small of the back again 
I just don't belong 
To anywhere 
I just don't belong 
Mmm ... 
Ah ...

 

LIFEGUARD SLEEPING, GIRL DROWNING

Always looking for attention 
Always needs to be mentioned 
Who does she 
Think she should be ? 
The shrill cry through darkening air 
Doesn't she know he's 
Had such a busy day ? 
Tell her ... sshhh
Somebody tell her ... sshhh 
Slowest ... 
It was only a test 
But she swam too far 
Against the tide 
She deserves all she gets 
The sky became marked with stars 
As an out-stretched arm slowly 
Disappears 
Hooray 
Oh hooray 
No, oh, oh, woh, there's no movement 
No, oh, hooray 
Oh, hooray 
Please don't worry 
There'll be no fuss 
She was ... nobody's nothing 
(What's your name ?) 
When he awoke 
The sea was calm 
And another day passes like a dream 
There's no ... no way 
(What's your name ?)

 

USED TO BE A SWEET BOY

Used to be a sweet boy 
Holding so tightly 
To Daddy's hand 
But that was all 
In some distant land 
Blazer and tie 
And a big bright healthy smile 
Used to make all 
Of our trials worthwhile 
Used to be a sweet boy 
And I'm not to blame 
Something went wrong 
And I know 
I'm not to blame 
Something went wrong 
Can't be to blame 
Ah ...

 

THE LAZY SUNBATHERS

A world war 
Was announced 
Days ago 
But they didn't know 
The lazy sunbathers 
The lazy sunbathers 
The sun burns through 
To the planet's core 
And it isn't enough 
They want more 
Nothing 
Appears 
To be 
Between the ears of 
The lazy sunbathers 
Too jaded 
To question stagnation 
The sun burns through 
To the planet's core 
And it isn't enough 
They want more 
Religions fall 
Children shelled 
"...Children shelled ? That's all 
Very well, but would you 
Please keep the noise 
Down low ? 
Because you're waking 
The lazy sunbathers ..."
Oh, the lazy sunbathers 
The lazy sunbathers

 

SPEEDWAY

And when you slam 
Down the hammer 
Can you see it in your heart ? 
All of the rumours 
Keeping me grounded 
I never said, I never said that they were 
Completely unfounded 
So when you slam 
Down the hammer 
Can you see it in your heart ? 
Can you delve so low ? 
And when you're standing 
On my fingers 
Can you see it in your heart ? ... ah ... 
And when you try 
To break my spirit 
It won't work 
Because there's nothing left to break 
Anymore 
All of the rumours 
Keeping me grounded 
I never said, I never said that they were 
Completely unfounded 
You won't sleep 
Until the earth that wants me 
Finally has me 
Oh you've done it now 
You won't rest 
Until the hearse that becomes me 
Finally takes me 
Oh you've done it now 
And you won't smile 
Until my loving mouth 
Is shut good and proper 
FOREVER 
All of the rumours 
Keeping me grounded 
I never said, I never said that they were 
Completely unfounded 
And all those lies 
Written lies, twisted lies 
Well, they weren't lies 
They weren't lies 
They weren't lies 
I never said 
I never said 
I could have mentioned your name 
I could have dragged you in 
Guilt by implication 
By association 
I've always been true to you 
In my own strange way 
I've always been true to you 
In my own sick way 
I'll always stay true to you

 

THE TEACHERS ARE AFRAID OF THE PUPILS

There's too many people 
Planning your downfall 
When your spirit's on trial 
These nights can be frightening 
Sleep transports sadness 
To some other mid-brain 
And somebody here 
Will not be here next year 
So you stand by the board 
Full of fear and intention 
And, if you think that they're listening 
Well, you've got to be joking 
Oh, you understand change 
And you think it's essential 
But when your profession 
Is humiliation 
Say the wrong word to our children ...
We'll have you, oh yes, we'll have you 
Lay a hand on our children 
And it's never too late to have you 
Mucus on your collar 
A nail up through the staff chair 
A blade in your soap 
And you cry into your pillow 
To be finished would be a relief 
To be finished would be a relief... 
Say the wrong word to our children ...
We'll have you, oh yes, we'll have you 
Lay a hand on our children 
And it's never too late to have you 
To be finished would be a relief 
To be finished would be a relief...
I'm very glad this thing has come 
Sometimes I'm so glad 
Never bother to play the tunes 
I've seen it coming for dear life

 

READER MEET AUTHOR

You don't know a thing about their lives 
They live where you wouldn't dare to drive
You shake as you think of how they sleep 
But you write as if you are my side-by-side 
Reader, meet Author 
With the hope of hearing sense 
But you may be feeling let down 
By the words of defence 
He says : "No-one ever sees me when I cry"
You don't know a thing about their lives 
Books don't save them, books aren't Stanley knives 
And if a fight broke out here tonight 
You'd be the first away, because you're that type 
And the Year 2000 won't change anyone here 
As each fabled promise flies so fast 
You'll swear it was never there 
Oh, have you ever escaped from a shipwrecked life ? 
So safely with your software; all miles from the front line 
You hear the way their sad voices, and you start to imagine things 
Oh, any excuse to write more lies

 

THE BOY RACER

He's just too good-natured and 
He's got too much money and 
He's got too many girlfriends 
I'm jealous, that's all

And I'm gonna ... kill him !
Oh, no ! Oh, no ! Oh, no ! Oh, no ! Oh, no !Oh .... 
Boy racer Boy racer, oh 
We're gonna kill this pretty thing...
He's just too good-looking, and, And, and ... 
Boy racer Boy racer, oh

THE OPERATION

You fight with your right hand 
And caress with your left hand 
Everyone I know is sick to death of you 
With a tear that's a mile wide 
In the kite that you're flying 
Everyone I know is sick to death of you 
Ever since 
You don't look the same 
You're just not the same, no way 
You say clever things and 
You never used to 
You don't catch what I'm saying 
When you're deafened to advice 
Everyone here is sick to the 
Back teeth of you 
With a tear that's a mile wide 
In the kite that you're flying 
Everyone here is sick to the 
Tattoo of you 
Ever since 
You don't look the same 
You're just not the same, no way 
You say pleasant things and 
There is no need to
Still, you fight with your right hand 
And caress with your left hand 
Ooh, ooh ... Sad to say ... 
How once I was in love with you 
Sad to say ... 
You don't catch what I'm saying 
When you're deafened to advice 
Ooh, ooh ... Ever since 
You don't look the same 
You're just not the same, no way 
What the hell have 
They stuck into you ?

 

DAGENHAM DAVE

Head in the clouds, and a mouthful of pie 
Head in a blouse, everybody loves him 
I see why 
Dagenham Dave, Dagenham Dave, Oh, Dagenham Dave 
Dagenham Dave, Dagenham Dave, Oh, Dagenham Dave 
"I love Karen, I love Sharon" on the windowscreen 
With never the need to fight or to question a single thing 
Dagenham Dave, Dagenham Dave Oh, Dagenham Dave 
Dagenham Dave, Dagenham Dave Oh, Dagenham Dave ...
He'd love to touch, he's afraid that he might self-combust 
I could say more, but you get the general idea 
Dagenham Dave, Dagenham Dave Dagenham Dave, Dagenham Dave 
Dagenham, Dagenham Dagenham Dave, Dagenham Dave ...
Oh, Dave, oh, Dagenham, dagenham, Oh, Dave, oh, Dave, ...

 

DO YOUR BEST AND DON'T WORRY

Compare the best of their days 
With the worst of your days 
You won't win 
With your standards so high 
And your spirits so low 
At least remember ... 
This is you on a bad day, you on a pale day 
Just do your best and don't ... Don't worry, oh 
The way you hang yourself is oh, so unfair 
See the best of how they look 
Against the worst of how you are
And again, you won't win 
With your standards so high 
And your spirits so low 
At least remember ... 
This is you on a drab day, you in a drab dress 
Just do your best and don't ... Don't worry, oh 
The way you hang yourself is oh, so unfair 
Just do your best and don't ... Don't worry, oh 
The way you watch yourself is oh, so unfair 
Just do your best and don't ... Don't worry, oh 
Do your best and don't ...

 

BEST FRIEND ON THE PAYROLL

I turn the music down; and I don't know why, this is my house 
I turn the music down; and I don't know why, this is my house 
The best friend on the payroll 
No, no, no, it's not gonna work out 
It's not gonna work out, No, no, no, no

SOUTHPAW

You were a boy before you became a man 
I don't see the joy 
And you ran with your pals in the sun 
You turned around and they were gone 
Again ... 
A sick boy should be treated 
So easily defeated 
Oh, I just don't understand 
So you ran with your pals in the sun 
You turned around 
You were alone 
Again ... 
And you ran back to Ma 
Which set the pace for the rest of your days 
Oh, you ran back to Ma 
Which set the pace for the rest of your days 
Oh, you ran back to Ma 
Which set the pace for the rest of your days 
And now, there is something that you should know 
There is something that you should know 
The girl of your dreams is 
Here all alone 
Girl of your dreams is 
Here all alone 
The girl of your dreams is 
Sad and all alone 
The girl of your dreams is 
Here all alone 
There is something that you should know 
There is something that you should know 
Girl of your dreams is 
Here all alone 
The girl of your dreams is 
Sad and is all alone 
The girl of your dreams is 
Sad and is feeling all alone 
Oh, there is something that you should know 
Help me, help me, help me ...

 

MALADJUSTED

I wanna start from 
Before the beginning 
Loot wine, "Be mine, and 
Then let's stay out for the night"
Ride via Parkside 
Semi-perilous lives 
Jeer the lights in the windows 
Of all safe and stable homes 
(But wondering then, well what 
Could peace of mind be like ?)
Anyway do you want to hear 
Our story, or not ? 
As the Fulham Road lights 
Stretch and invite into the night 
From a Stevenage overspill 
We'd kill to live around 
SW6 - with someone like you 
Keep thieves' hours 
With someone like you 
...As long as it slides 
You stalk the house 
In a low-cut blouse : 
"Oh Christ, another stifled 
Friday night !"
And the Fulham Road lights 
Stretch and invite into the night 
Well, I was fifteen 
What could I know ?
When the gulf between 
All the things I need 
And the things I receive 
Is an ancient ocean 
Wide, wild, lost, uncrossed 
Still I maintain there's nothing 
Wrong with you 
You do all that you do 
Because it's all you can do 
Well, I was fifteen 
Where could I go ?
With a soul full of loathing 
For stinging bureaucracy 
Making it anything 
Other than easy 
For working girls like me 
With my hands on my head 
I flop on your bed 
With a head full of dread 
For all I've ever said 
Maladjusted, maladjusted 
Maladjusted maladjusted 
Never to be trusted 
Oh, never to be trusted 
There's nothing wrong with you, oh 
...There's nothing wrong with you

 

ALMA MATTERS

So : the choice I have made 
May seem strange to you 
But who asked you, anyway ? 
It's my life to wreck 
My own way 
You see : to someone, somewhere, oh yeah ... 
Alma matters 
In mind, body and soul 
In part, and in whole 
Because to someone, somewhere, oh yeah ... 
Alma matters 
In mind, body and soul 
In part, and in whole 
So the life I have made 
May seem wrong to you 
But, I've never been surer 
It's my life to ruin 
My own way 
You see : to someone, somewhere, oh yeah ... 
Alma matters 
In mind, body and soul 
In part, and in whole 
Because to someone, somewhere, oh yeah ... 
Alma matters 
In mind, body and soul 
In part, and in whole 
To someone, somewhere, oh yeah ... 
Alma matters 
In mind, body and soul 
Part, and in whole 
So to someone, somewhere, oh yeah ... 
Alma matters 
In mind, body and soul 
Part, and in whole 
To someone, somewhere, oh yeah ... 
Oh yeah ... Oh yeah, oh yeah Oh yeah ...

 

AMBITIOUS OUTSIDERS

Bolt-lock your doors 
Alarm your cars 
And still we move in closer 
Every day 
Top of the list 
Is your smiling kids 
But we'll be smiling too 
So that's OK 
Oh, and by the way 
Thank you, because you're 
Giving, giving, giving 
And we're receiving - 
No, no, we're taking 
Keeping the population down 
Your taxes paid, but 
Police waylaid 
And we knows 
When the school bus 
Comes and goes 
We're on your street, but 
You don't see us 
Or, if you do 
You smile and say Hello 
BUT DON'T UNDERESTIMATE US 
When you are 
Giving, giving, giving 
And we're receiving - 
No, no, we're taking 
Just keeping 
The population down 
You're giving, giving, giving 
Well, it's your own fault 
For reproducing 
We're just keeping 
The population down

 

TROUBLE LOVES ME

Trouble loves me 
Trouble needs me 
Two things 
More than you do 
Or would attempt to 
So, console me 
Otherwise, hold me 
Just when it seems like 
Everything's evened out 
And the balance 
Seems serene 
Trouble loves me 
Walks beside me 
To chide me 
Not to guide me 
It's still much more 
Than you'll do 
So, console me 
Otherwise, hold me 
Just when it seems like 
Everything's evened out 
And the balance seems serene 
See the fool I'll be 
Still running 'round 
On the flesh rampage 
Still running 'round 
Ready with ready-wit 
Still running 'round 
On the flesh rampage 
- At your age ! 
Go to Soho, oh 
Go to waste in 
The wrong arms 
Still running 'round 
Trouble loves me 
Seeks and finds me 
To charlatanize me 
Which is only 
As it should be 
Oh, please fulfill me 
Otherwise, kill me 
Show me a barrel and watch me scrape it 
Faced with the music, as always I'll face it 
In the half-light 
So English, frowning 
Then at midnight I 
Can't get you out of my head 
A disenchanted taste 
Still running 'round 
A disenchanted taste 
Still running 'round

 

PAPA JACK

Papa Jack 
Wants to turn 
Back the clock 
And reach out 
To the kids 
He once had 
Who have flown 
Papa Jack 
In decline 
Feels inclined 
To reach out 
To the kids 
He once had 
Who have flown 
But there was a time 
When the kids reached up 
And Papa Jack just 
Pushed them away 
Looking deep 
In his heart 
Papa Jack 
Doesn't like 
What he sees 
Or the time 
On his hands 
The dying day 
The chilly sun 
Papa Jack 
All alone 
Sings slow 
Grieving and low 
But there was a time 
When the kids reached up 
Now you can't always 
Have it your way 
Papa Jack 
Ah ...

 

AMMUNITION

I know these roads 
Each ridge 
And narrow bridge 
Each cheveron 
Enticing me on 
Each warning sign 
I take in my stride 
I don't need more ammunition 
I've got more than I can spend 
I don't dwell on things I'm missing 
I'm just pleased 
With the things I've found 
I know these roads 
An old hand understands 
Above all, I know what's 
Expected of me now 
Veering cliffwards 
I don't need more ammunition 
I've got more than I can spend 
I don't dwell on things I'm missing 
I'm just pleased 
With the things I've found 
With the things I've found 
With the things I've found 
I've found 
I've been crying 
It comes back on these salient days 
And it stays 
And it says : 
"We've never really been away" 
I don't need more ammunition 
I've got more than I can spend 
I don't think of who I'm missing 
I've got no space and no time 
In my life, anymore 
No space or time 
In my life, anymore 
For Revenge

 

WIDE TO RECEIVE

Download something 
Useful, or useless 
Because I'm lying here 
Wide to receive 
Almost anything 
You'd care to give 
And I don't 
Get along with myself 
And I'm not too keen 
On anyone else 
Turn on, plug in 
Then just walk away 
Unlock, process 
And then just go 
And I've never felt quite so alone 
As I do right now 
I'm lying here 
Wide to receive 
Almost anything 
You'd care to leave 
Wide, wide, wide Wide, wide, wide...

 

ROY'S KEEN

(GO ON !)
He's romancing you 
And chancing his arm 
He'll be here 
Smiling on time 
He's romancing you 
And chancing his arm 
He'll be here 
Smiling on time 
Roy's keen oh Roy's keen 
Roy's keen oh Roy's keen 
We've never seen a 
Keener window-cleaner 
Back up the ladder 
Into each corner 
Dunking the chamois 
Just think of the goodwill 
The ladder's a planet 
Roy is a star, and 
I am a satellite 
(But that's alright) 
He can hold a smile for as long 
As you require (even longer) 
He can hold a smile for as long 
As you require (even longer) 
Roy's keen oh Roy's keen 
Roy's keen oh Roy's keen 
We've never seen a 
Keener window-cleaner 
Back up the ladder 
Into each corner 
Dunking the chamois 
Just think of the goodwill 
The ladder's a planet 
Roy is a star, and 
I am a satellite 
I will be set alight 
Don't say you'll hold it steady 
Then you let it go 
Don't say you'll hold it steady 
Then you let it go Oh ...
You're up the ladder 
Into each corner 
Foot in a bucket 
We trust you to wreck it 
Even when it's under your nose 
Well, you just can't 
See it, can you ? 
Well, it's here 
Right under your nose 
And you just can't 
See it, can you? La la la la ...
Roy's keen, Roy's keen La la la la ...
We've never seen a 
Keener window-cleaner 
Oh ... La la la la ...

 

HE CRIED

I need you 
Simple words 
But words which had never been heard 
By the soul 
Stoned to death 
But still living 
And so he froze where he stood 
And he looked to the ground 
And he cried 
He cried 
Ride our minds 
If you must 
But there's always a line you don't cross 
Time is short 
Don't be cruel 
Oh you don't know the power 
In what you're saying 
Oh ... 
And so he froze where he stood 
And he looked to the ground 
And he cried 
He cried 
People where 
I come from 
They survive without feelings or blood 
I never could 
Was stoned to death 
But I'm still living 
So he froze where he stood 
And he looked to the ground 
And he cried 
He cried 
So he froze 
And he looked, and he looked 
To the ground 
And he cried 
He cried

 

SORROW WILL COME IN THE END

Legalized theft 
Leaves me bereft 
I get it straight in the neck 
(Somehow expecting no less) 
A court of justice 
With no use for Truth 
Lawyer ...liar 
Lawyer ...liar 
You pleaded and squealed 
And you think you've won 
But Sorrow will come 
To you in the end 
And as sure as my words are pure 
I praise the day that brings you pain 
Q.C.'s obsessed with sleaze 
Frantic for Fame 
They're all on the game 
They just use a different name 
You lied 
And you were believed 
By a J.P. senile and vile 
You pleaded and squealed 
And you think you've won 
But Sorrow will come 
To you in the end 
And as sure as my words are pure 
I praise the day that brings you pain 
So don't close your eyes 
Don't close your eyes 
A man who slits throats 
Has time on his hands 
And I'm gonna get you 
So don't close your eyes 
Don't ever close your eyes 
You think you've won 
OH NO

 

SATAN REJECTED MY SOUL

Satan rejected my soul 
He knows my kind 
He won't be dragged down 
He's seen my face around 
He knows Heaven doesn't seem 
To be my home 
So I must find 
Somewhere else to go 
So I must find 
Somewhere else to go 
So, take it - please 
It's free 
You'll never see 
You'll never see 
All the fun in life it's cost me 
Satan rejected my soul 
As low as he goes 
He never quite goes this low 
He's seen my face around 
He knows Heaven doesn't seem 
To be my home 
So I must find 
Somewhere else to go 
So I must find 
Somewhere else to go 
So, take it please 
It's really sly 
Come on, come on, ah Come on, come on, come on 
Take it please, It's really sly 
Come on, come on, ah Come on, come on, come on 
Call me in, Pull me in, call me in 
Come on, come on, oh Come on, come on, come on 
Pull me in, pull me in, Call me in, haul me in, pull me in 
Come on, come on, ah, Come on, come on 
La la la la la, Oh ...

 
 REEL AROUND THE FOUNTAIN

It's time the tale was told
of how you took a child
and you made him old
Reel around the fountain
slap me on the patio
I'll take it now
Fifteen minutes with you
well, I wouldn't say no
people said that you were virtually dead
and they were so wrong
fifteen minutes with you
well, i wouldn't say no
people said that you were easily led
and they were half-right
I dreamt about you last night
and i fell out of bed twice
you can pin and mount me like a butterfly
but take me to the haven of your bed
was something that you never said
two lumps, please
you're the bee's knees
but so am I
Meet me at the fountain
shove me on the patio
I'll take it slowly
Fifteen minutes with you
oh I wouldn't say no
people see no worth in you
oh but I do

 

YOU'VE GOT EVERYTHING NOW

As merry as the days were long
I was right and you were wrong
back at the old grey school
I would win and you would lose
But you've got everything now
and what a terrible mess I've made of my life
No, I've never had a job
because I've never wanted one
I've seen you smile
but I've never really heard you laugh
So who is rich and who is poor?
I cannot say...
You are your mother's only son
and you're a desperate one
But I don't want a lover
I just want to be seen in the back of your car
A friendship sadly lost?
Well, this is true ...and yet, it's false
Did I ever tell you , by the way
I never did like your face
But you've got everything now
and what a terrible mess I've made of my life
No, I've never had a job
because I'm too shy
But I don't want a lover
I just want to be tied to the back of your car.

 

MISERABLE LIE

So, goodbye
please stay with your own kind
and I'll stay with mine
There's something against us
it's not time
So, goodbye
I know I hardly say
how much I love your casual way
but please put your tongue away
a little higher and we're well away
the dark nights are drawing in
and your humour is as black as them
I look at yours, you laugh at mine
and"love" is just a miserable lie
you have destroyed my flower like-life
not once-but twice
you have corrupt my innocent mind
not once-but twice
I know that wind-swept mystical air
it means: I'd like to see your underwear
I recognise that mystical air
it means: I'd like to see your underwear
what do we get for the trouble and pain?
just a rented room in Whalley Range
into the depths of the criminal world
I followed her...
I need advice, I need advice
because nobody ever looks at me twice
I'm just a country-mile behind
the world
I'm just a country mile behind
the whole world
so take me when you go

 

PRETTY GIRLS MAKE GRAVES

Upon the sand,upon the bay
"there is a quick and easy way" you say
before you illustrate
I'd rather state:
"I'm not the man you think I am
I'm not the man you think I am "
And Sorrow's native son
he will not smile for anyone
And pretty girls makes the graves
End of the pier, end of the bay
you tug my arm and say:"Give into lust,
give up to lust, oh heaven knows we'll
soon be dust..."
But I'm not the man you think I am
I'm not the man you think I am
And Sorrow's native son
he will not rise for anyone
And pretty girls make graves
I could have been wild and I could have been free
but Nature played this trick on me
She wants it Now
and she will not wait
but she's too rough
and I'm too delicate
Then on the sand
another man, he takes her hand
and a smile lights up her stupid face
(and well, it would)
I lost my faith in Womanhood
I lost my faith in Womanhood, I lost my faith

 

THE HAND THAT ROCKS THE CRADLE

Please don't cry
the ghost and the storm outside
will not invade this sacred shire
nor infiltrate your mind
my life down I shall lie
if the bogey-man should try
to play tricks on your sacred mind
to tease, torment and tantalise
wavering shadows loom
a piano plays in an empty room
there'll be blood on the cleaver tonight
when darkness lifts and the room is bright
I'll still be by your side
for you are all that matters
and I'll love you till the day I die
there never need to be longing in your eyes
as long as the hand that rocks the cradle is mine
ceiling shadows shimmy by
and when the wardrobe towers like a beast of prey
there's a sadness in your beautiful eyes
you're untouched, unsoiled, wonderous eyes
my life down I shall lie
should restless spirts try
to play tricks on you sacred mind
but whom I never gave a name
I just looked into his wonderous eyes
and said" never never never again"
all too soon I did return
just like a moth to a flame
so rattle my bones all over the stones
because I'm only a beggar-man whom nobody owns
see how words as old as sin
fit me like a glove I'm here and here I'll stay
together we lie, together we pray
there never need be longing in your eyes
as long as the hand that rocks the cradle is mine

 

STILL ILL

I decree today that life
is simply taking and not giving
England is mine and it owes me a living
ask me why, and I'll spit in your eye
ask me why, and I'll spit in your eye
but we cannot cling to the old dreams anymore
no, we cannot cling to the old dreams anymore
Does the body rule the mind
or does the mind rule the body?
I dunno...
Under the iron bridge we kissed
and although I ended up with sore lips
it just wasn't like the old days anymore
no, it wasn't like those days
am I still ill?
Does the body rule the mind
or does the mind rule the body ?
I dunno...
Ask me why, and I'll die
ask me why, and I'll die
and if you must go to work tomorrow
well, if I were you I wouldn't bother
for there are brighter sides to life
and I should know because I've seen them
but not very often...
under the iron bridge we kissed
and although I ended up with sore lips
it just wasn't like the old days anymore
no, it wasn't like those days
am I still ill?

 

HAND IN GLOVE

Hand in glove
the sun shines out of our behinds
no, it's not like any other love
this one is different-because it's us
Hand in glove
we can go wherever we please
and everything depends upon
how near you stand to me
And if the people stare
then the people stare
I really don't know and I really don't care
Hand in glove
the Good People laugh
yes, we may be hidden by rags
but we have something they'll never have
So, hand in glove I stake my claim
I'll fight to the last breath
If they dare touch a hair on your head
I'll fight to the last breath
The Good Life is out there, somewhere
so stay on my arm, you little charmer
But I know my luck too well
and I'll probably never see you again.

 

WHAT DIFFERENCE DOES IT MAKE?

All men have secrets and here is mine
so let it be known
we have been through hell and high tide,
I can surely rely on you?
and yet you start to recoil,
heavy words are so lightly thrown
but still I'd leap in front of a flying bullet for you
So, what difference does it make?
so, what difference does it make?
it makes none
but you have gone
and you must be looking very old tonight
The devil will find work for idle hands to do
I stole and I lied, and why?
because you asked me to!
but now you make feel so ashamed
because I've only got two hands
well, I'm still fond of you
So, what difference does it make?
so, what difference does it make?
it makes none
but you have gone
and your prejudice won't keep you warm tonight
So, no more apologies
no more apologies
I'm too tired
I'm too sick and tired
and I'm feeling very sick and ill today
But I'm still fond of you

 

I DON'T OWE YOU ANYTHING

Bought on stolen wine
a nod was the first step
you know very well
what was coming next
did I really walk all this way
just to hear you say
"oh I don't want to go out tonight"
but you will
for you must
I don't owe you anything
but you owe me something
repay me now
you should never go to them
let them come to you
just like I do
you should not go to them
let them come to you
just like I do
Too freely on your lips
words prematurely said
oh but I know what will make you smile tonight
Life is never kind
life is never kind
oh but I know what will make you smile tonight

 

SUFFER LITTLE CHILDREN

Over the moors,take me to the moors
dig a shallow grave
and I'll lay me down
Lesley-Anne, with your pretty white beads
oh John, you'll never be a man
and you'll never see your home again
oh Manchester, so much to answer for
Edward, see those alluring lights?
tonight will be your very last night
a woman said "I know my son is dead
I'll never rest my hands on his scared head"
Hindley wakes and Hindley says:
"Wherever he has gone, I have gone "
But fresh lilaced moorland fields
cannot hide the stoild stench of death
Hindley wakes and Hindley says:
"Whatever he has done, I have done"
But this is no easy ride
for a child cries
"find me...find me, nothing more
we're on a sullen misty moor
we may be dead and we may be gone
but we will be right by your side
until the day you die
this is no easy ride
we will haunt you when you laugh
yes, you could say we're a team
you might sleep
BUT YOU WILL NEVER DREAM!"
Oh Manchester, so much to answer for
Oh Manchester, so much to answer for
Over the moor, I'm on the moor
the child is on the moor

 

THE HEADMASTER RITUAL

Belligerent ghouls
run Manchester schools
spineless swines
cemented mines
Sir leads the troops
jealous of youth
same old suit since 1962
he does the military two-step
down the nape of my neck
I wanna go home
I don't want to stay
give up education
is a bad mistake
mid-week on the playing fields
Sir thwacks you on the knees
knees you in the groin
elbow in the face
I wanna go home
I don't want to stay
Belligerent ghouls
run Manchester schools
spineless bastards all
Sir leads the troops
jealous of youth
same old jokes since 1902
he does the military two-step
down the nape of my neck
I wanna go home
I don't want to stay
give up life
as a bad mistake
please excuse me from gym
I've got this terrible cold coming on
he grabs and devours
he kicks me in the showers
kicks me in the showers
and he grabs and devours
I wanna go home
I don't want to stay

 

RUSHOLME RUFFIANS

The last night at the fair
by the big wheel generator
a boy is stabbed
and his money is grabbed
and the air hangs heavy like a dulling wine
she is famous
she is funny
an engagement ring
doesn't mean a thing
to a mind consumed by brass(money)
and though I walk home alone
my faith in love is still devout
the last night at the fair
from a seat on a whirling waltzer
her skirt ascends for a watching eye
it's a hideous trait( on her mother's side)
and though I walk home alone
my faith in love is still devout
then someone falls in love
and someone's beaten up
and the senses being dulled are mine

this is the last night of the fair

of a speedway operator
is all a tremulous heart requires
a schoolgirl is denied
she said "How quickly would I die
if I jumped from the top of the parachutes?"

I WANT THE ONE I CAN'T HAVE

On the day that your mentality
catches up with your biology
I want the one I can't have
and it's driving me mad
it's written all over my face
A double-bed
and a stalwart lover, for sure
these are the riches of the poor
A double-bed
and a stalwart lover, for sure
these are the riches of the poor
a tough kid who sometimes swallows nails
raised on Prisoner's Aid
he killed a policeman when he was thirteen
and somehow that really impressed me
it's written all over my face
On the day that your mentality
catches up with your biology
And if you ever need self-validation
just meet me in the alley by the
railway-station
it's written all over my face

 

WHAT SHE SAID

What she said:
"How come someone hasn't noticed
that I'm dead
and decided to bury me
God knows, I'm ready"
What she said was
but then, all the rejection she's had
to pretend to be happy
could only be idiocy
What she said was not for the job or
lover that she never had
What she read
all heady books
she'd sit and prophesise
(it took a tattoed boy from Birkenhead
to really really open her eyes)

THAT JOKE ISN'T FUNNY ANYMORE

Park the car at the side of the road
you should know
time's tide will smother you
and I will too
when you laugh about other people who feel so
very lonely
their only desire is to die
well I'm afraid
it doesn't make me smile
I wish I could laugh
but that joke isn't funny anymore
it's too close to home and it's too near the bone
it's too close to home and it's too near the bone
more than you'll ever know
It was dark as I drove the point home
and on cold leather seats
well, it suddenly struck me
I just might die with a smile on my
face after all
I've seen this happen in other people's lives
and now it's happening in mine

 

NOWHERE FAST

I'd like to drop my trousers to the world
I am a man of means(of slender means)
each household appliance
is like a new science in my town
and if a day came when I felt a natural emotion
I'd get such a shock I'd probably jump in the ocean
and when a train goes by
it's such a sad sound
I'd like to drop my trousers to the Queen
every sensible child will know what this means
the poor and the needy
are selfish and greedy on her terms
and if the day came when I felt a natural emotion
I'd get such a shock I'd probably jump in the ocean
and when a train goes by
it's such a sad song
And when I'm lying in my bed
I think about life
and I think about death
and neither one particularly appeals to me
and if the day came when I felt a natural emotion
I'd get such a shock I'd probably lie
in the middle of the street and die
I'd lie down and die

 

WELL I WONDER

Well I wonder
do you hear me when you sleep?
I hoarsely cry
Well I wonder
do you see me when we pass?
I half-die
Please keep me in mind
please keep me in mind
Gasping-but somehow still alive
this is the fierce last stand of all I am
Gasping-dying-but somehow still alive
this is the final stand of all I am
Please keep me in mind

 

BARBARISM BEGINS AT HOME

Unruly boys
who will not grow up
must be taken in hand
Unruly girls
who will not settle down
they must be taken in hand
A crack on the head
is what you get for not asking
and a crack on the head
is what you get for asking

 

MEAT IS MURDER

Heifer whines could be human cries
closer comes the screaming knife
this beautiful creature must die
this beautiful creature must die
a death for no reason
and death for reason is MURDER
and the flesh you so fancifully fry
is not succulent, tasty or nice
it's death for no reason
and death for no reason is MURDER
and the calf that you carve with a smile
is MURDER
and the turkey you festively slice
is MURDER
do you know how animals die?
kitchen aroma aren't very homely
it's not "comforting," "cheery" or kind
it's sizzling blood and the unholy stench
of MURDER
it's not "natural," "normal" or kind
the fleas you so fancifully fry
as you savour the flavour
of MURDER
NO, NO, NO, IT'S MURDER
NO, NO, NO, IT'S MURDER
who hears when animals cry?

 

THE QUEEN IS DEAD

Farewell to this lands cheerless marches
hemmed in like a boar between arches
her very Lowness with her head in a sling
Im truely sorry-but it sounds like a wonderful thing
dear Charles, dont you ever crave
to appear on the front of the Daily mail
dressed in your Mother's bridal veil?
So, I checked all the registered historical facts
and I was shocked into shame to discover
how Im the 18th pale descendent
of some, old queen or other
has the world changed, or have I changed?
has the world changed, or have I changed?
as some 9-year old tough peddles drugs
(I never even knew what drugs were)
And so, I broke into the Palace
with a sponge and a rusty spanner
she said: "Eh, I know you, and you cannot sing"
I said: "that's nothing -you should hear me play piano"
We can go for a walk where it's quiet and dry
and we can talk about precious things
but when you are tied to your mother's apron
not one talks about castration
We can go for a walk where it's quiet and dry
and we can talk about precious things
like love and law and poverty
these are the things that kill me
We can go for a walk where it's quiet and dry
and we can talk about precious things
but the rain that flattens my hair
theses are the things that kill me
Passed the Pub that saps your body
and the church who'll snatch your money
the Queen is dead, boys
and it's so lonely on a limb
Pass the Pub that wrecks your body
and the church-all they want is your money
the Queen is dead, boys`
you can trust me, boys
life is very long, when you're lonely
life is very long, when you're lonely...

 

FRANKLY MR.SHANKLY

Frankly, Mr Shankly, this position Ive held
it pays my way, but it corrodes my soul
I want to leave you will not miss me
I want to go down in musical history
Frankly, Mr Shankly, Im a sickening wreck
Ive got the 21st Century breathing down my neck
I must move fast, you understand me
I want to go down in celluloid history
Fame, Fame, fatal Fame
it can play hideous tricks on the brain
but still I rather be Famous
than righteous or holy, any day
but sometimes Id feel more fulfilled
making Christmas cards with the mentally ill
I want to Live and I want to Love
I want to catch something that I might be ashamed of
Frankly, Mr Shankly, this position I've held
it pays my way and it corrodes my soul
oh, I didnt realise that you wrote poetry
(I didnt realise you wrote such bloody awful poetry)
Frankly, Mr Shankly, since you ask
you are a flatulent pain the arse
I do not mean to be so rude
but still, I must speck frankly, Mr Shankly

 

I KNOW IT'S ALL OVER

Oh Mother, I can fell the soil falling over my head
and as i climb into an empty bed
Oh well, Enough said
I know it's over-still I cling
I don't know where else I can go
Oh Mother, I can feel the soil falling over my head
see, the sea want s to take me
the knife wants to cut me
do you think you can help me?
Sad veiled bride, please be happy
handsome groom, give her room
loud, loutish lover, treat her kindly
(although she needs you
more than she loves you)
and I know it's over
and it never really began
but in my heart it was so real
and you even spoke to me and said:
"If you're so funny
then why are you on your own tonight?
and if you are so clever
then why are you on your own tonight?
if you're so terribly good looking
then why do you sleep alone tonight?
because tonight is just like any other night
that's why you're on your own tonight
with your triumphs and your charms
while they are in each other's arms.."
It's so easy to laugh
it's so easy to hate
it takes strength to be gentle and kind
It's so easy to laugh
it's so easy to hate
it takes guts to be gentle and kind
love is Natural and Real
but not for you, my love
not tonight my love
love is Natural and Real
but not for such as you and I, my love
Oh Mother, I can fell the soil falling over my head
Oh Mother, I can fell the soil falling over my head...

 

NEVER HAD NO ONE EVER

When you walk without ease
on these
the very streets where you were raised
I had a really bad dream
it lasted 20 years, 7 months, and 27 days
Never had no one ever.

 

CEMETERY GATES

A dreaded sunny day
so I meet you at the cemetry gates
Keats and Yeats are on your side
A dreaded sunny day
so I meet you at the cemetry gates
Keats and Yeats are on your side
while Wilde is on mine
So we go inside and we gravely read the stones
all those people all those lives
where are they now ?
with loves, and hates
and passions just like mine
they were born
and then they lived and then they died
which seems so unfair
and I wantr to crv
You say: "ere thrice the sun hath done salutation to the dawn"
and you claim these words as your own
but Im well-read, have heard them said
a hundred times (maybe less, maybe more)
if you must write prose/poems
the words you use should be your own
dont plagiarise or take "on loans"
there's alweays someone, somewhere
with a big nose, who knows
and who trips you up and laughs
when you fall
You say: "ere long done do does did "
words which could only be your own
you then produce the text
from whence was ripped
(some dizzy whore, 1804)
A dreaded sunny day
so let's go where we're happy
so I meet you at the cemetry gates
Keats and Yeats are on your side
A dreaded sunny day
so let's go where we're wanted
so I meet you at the cemetry gates
Keats and Yeats are on your side
but you lose
because Wilde is on mine

 

BIGMOUTH STRIKES AGAIN

Sweetness, sweetness I was only joking
when I said Id like to smash every tooth
in your head
Sweetness, sweetness I was only joking
when I said by right s you should be
bludgeoned in your bed
and now I know how Joan of Arc felt
now I know how Joan of Arc felt
as the flames roseto her roman nose
and her Walkman stared to melt
Bibmouth, bigmouth
bigmouth strikes again
and Ive got no right to take my place
with the Human race
and now I know how Joan of Arc felt
now I know of Joan of Arc felt
as the flames rose to her roman nose
and her hearing aid started to melt
Bigmouth, bigmouth
bigmouth strikes again
and Ive got no right to take my place

THE BOY WITH A THORN IN HIS SIDE

The boy with the thorn in his side
behind the hatred there lies
a murderous desire for love
how can they look into my eyes
and still they dont believe me
how can they hear me say those words
and still they dont believe me
and if they don't believe me now
will they ever believe me?
and if they don't believe me now
will they ever believe me?
The boy with the thorn in his side
behind the hatred there lies
a plundering desire for love
how can they see the Love in our eyes
and still they don't believe us
and after all this time
they don't want to believe us
and if they dont believe us now
will they ever believe us ?
andd when you want to Live
how do you start ?
where do you go ?
who do you know?

 

VICAR IN A TUTU

I was minding mind business
lifting some lead off
the roof of the Holy Name church
it was worthwhile living a laughable life
just to set my eyes on a blistering sight
of a vicar in a tu-tu
he's not strange
he just wants to live his life this way
a scanty bit of a thing
with a decorative ring
that wouldn't cover the head of a child
as Rose collects the money in the cannister
who comes sliding down the bannister
the vicar in a tu-tu
he's not strange
he just wants to live his life this way
the monkish monsignor
with a head full of plaster
said "my man, get your vile soul dry-cleaned"
as Rose counts the money in the cannister
as natural as rain
he dances again
vicar in a tu-tu
The next day in the pulpit
with Freedom and Ease
combating ignoranca,dust and disease
as Rose counts the money in the cannister
as natural as rain
he dances again
the fabric of a tu-tu
any man could get us to
and I am a living sign.

 

THERE IS A LIGHT THAT NEVER GOES OUT

Take me out tonight
where there's music and there's people
who are young and alive
driving in your car
I never never want to go home
because I havent got one
anymore
take me out tonight
because I want to see people and I
want to see lights
driving in your car
oh please dont drop me home
because it's not my home, it's their
home, and Im welcome no morw
and if a double-decker bus
crashes in to us
to die by your side
such a heavenly way to die
and if a ten ton truck
kills the both of us
to die by your side
the pleasure and the privilege is mine
take me out tonight
oh take me anywhere, I dont care
and in the darken underpass
I thought Oh God, my chance has come at last
(but then a strange fear gripped me and I just couldn't ask)
take me out tonight
take me anywhere, I dont care
just driving in your car
I never never want to go home
because I havent got one
I havent got one.

 

SOME GIRLS ARE BIGGER THAN OTHERS

From the ice-age to the dole-age
there is but one concern
and I have just discover
some girls are bigger than others
some girls are bigger than others
some girls mothers are bigger than
other girls mothers
As Anthony said to Cleopatra
as he opened a crate of ale:
some girls are bigger than others
some girls are bigger than others
some girls mothers are bigger than
other girls mothers.

 

A RUSH AND A PUSH AND AND THE LAND IS OURS

HELLO
I am the ghost of Troubled Joe
hung by his pretty white neck
some eighteen months ago
I travelled to a mystical time zone
but I missed my bed
so I soon came home
they said:
"there's too much caffeine
in your bloodstream
and a lack of real spice
in your life"
I said:
"leave me alone
because I'm alright, dad
just surprised to still
be on my own...."
Ooh, but don't mention love
I'd hate the real strain of the pain again
a rush and a push and the land that
we stand on is ours
it has been before
so it shall be again
and people who are uglier than you and I
they take what they need, and leave
Ooh, but don't mention love
I'd hate the pain and the strain all over again
a rush and a push and the land that
we stand on is ours
it has been before
so why can't it be now?
and people who are weaker than you and I
they take what they want from life
Ooh, but don't mention love
no - just don't mention love!
a rush and a push and the land that
we stand on is ours
your youth may be gone
but you're still a young man
so phone me, phone me, phone me
so phone me, phone me, phone me
Ooh, I think I'm in love...
Urrgh, I think I'm in lerv

 

I STARTED SOMETHING I COULDN'T FINISH

The lanes were silent
with nothing or no one around for miles
I doused our friendly venture
with a hard-faced
three-word gesture
I started something
I forced you into a zone
and you were clearly
never meant to go
hair brushed and parted
typical me, typical me, typical me
I started something
...and now I'm not too sure
I grabbed you by the guilded beams
that's what Tradition means
and I doused another venture
with a gesture
that was...absolutely vile
I started something
forced you to a zone
and you were clearly
never meant to go
hair brushed and parted
typical me, typical me, typical me
I started something
...and now I'm not too sure
I grabbed you by the guilded beams
that's what Tradition means
and now eighteen months' hard-labour
seems...fair enough

DEATH OF A DISCO DANCER

The death of a disco dancer
well, it happens a lot 'round here
and if you think Peace
is a common goal
well, that goes to show
just how little you know
The death of a disco dancer
well, I'd rather not get involved
I never talk to my neighbour
I'd just rather not get involved
Love, peace and harmony?
Love, peace and harmony?
Oh, very nice, very nice, very nice, very nice
...but maybe in the next world.

Girlfriend in a coma, I know
I know - it's really serious
there wree times when I could
have 'murdered' her

anything to happen to her)
NO, I DON'T WANT TO SEE HER
Do you really think
she'll pull through?

STOP ME IF YOU'VE HEARD THIS ONE BEFORE

Stop me, stop me,
stop me if you think that you've heard this one before
stop me, stop me
stop me if you think that you've heard this one before
nothing's changed
I still love you, oh I still love you
...only slightly less than I used to
I was delayed, I was way-laid
an emergency stop
I smelt the last ten seconds of life
I crashed down on the crossbar
and the pain was enough to make
a shy, bald buddhist reflect
and plan a mass-murder
who said I'd lied to her?
who said I'd lied because I never
who said I'd lied because I never
I was detained, I was restrained
he broke my spleen
he broke my knees
(and then he really laid into me)
Friday night in Out-patients
who said I'd lied to her?
who said I'd lied - because I never
who said I'd lied - because I never
Oh, so I drank one
or was it four
and when I fell on the floor
...I drank more
stop me, stop me
stop me if you think that you've heard this one before
nothing's changed
I still love you, I still love you
but only slightly
less than I used to

 

LAST NIGHT I DREAMT THAT SOMEBODY LOVED ME

Last night I dreamt
that somebody loved me
no hope - but no harm
just another false alarm
Las night I felt
real arms around me
no hope - no harm
just another false alarm
so, tell me how long
before the last one?
and tell me how long
before the right one?
this story is old - I KNOW
but it goes on
this story is old - I KNOW
but it goes on

 

UNHAPPY BIRTHDAY

I've come to wish you an unhappy birthday
I've come to wish you an unhappy birthday
because you're evil
and you lie
and if you should die
I may feel slightly sad
(but I won't cry)
Loved and lost
and some may say
when usually its Nothing
surely you're happy
it should be this way?
I say "No, I'm gonna kill my dog"
and: "May the lines sag heavy
and deep tonight XXX"

PAINT A VULGAR PICTURE

At the record company meeting
On their hands - a dead star
and ooh, the plans that they weave
and ooh, the sikening greed
At the record company meeting
on their hands - a dead star
the sycophantic slags all say:
"I knew him first, and I knew him well"
Re-issue! Re-package! Re-package!
Re-evaluate the songs
double-pack with a photograph
Extra Track (and a tacky badge)
A-list, playlist
"Please them, please them!"
"Please them! Please them!"
(sadly, THIS was your life)
but you could have said no
if you'd wanted to
you could have said no
if you'd wanted to
BPI, MTV, BBC
"Please them! Please them!"
(sadly this was your life)
but you could have said no
if you'd wanted to
you could have walked away
...couldn't you?
I touched you at the soundcheck
you had no real way of knowing
in my heart I bgged "please, take
me with you...
I don't care where you're going"
But to you I was faceless
I was fawning, I was boring
just a child from those ugly new houses
who could never begin to know
who could never really know
Best of? Most of?
Satiate the need
slip them into different sleeves!
Buy both, and be decieved
climber - new entry, re-entry
World tour! ("media whore")
"Please the Press in Belgium!"
(THIS was your life...)
and when it fails to recoup?
Well, maybe:
You just haven't earned it yet, baby
I walked a pace behind you at the soundcheck
you're just the same as I am
what makes most people feel happy
leads us headlong into harm
so, in my bedroom in those 'ugly new houses'
I dance my legs down to the knees
but me and my 'true love'
we will never meet again...
At the record company meeting
on their hands - at last! - a dead star!
but they cannot taint you in my eyes
no, they cannout touch you now
No, they cannot hurt you my darling
they cannot touch you now
but me and my 'true love'
will never meet again

 

DEATH AT ONE'S ELBOW

Ooh Glenn, don't come to the house tonight
Ooh, Glenn, don't come to the house tonight
because there's somebody here
who really really loves you
stay home
be bored
(it's crap, I KNOW)
Ooh, Glenn, don't come to the house tonight
Ooh, Glen, don't come to the house tonight
because there's somebody here
who'll take a hatchet to your ear
how the frustration renders me
hateful, Glenn!
don't come to the house tonight
don't come to the house tonight
because you'll slip on the
trail of my bespattered remains
and so, that's why
GOODBYE MY LOVE, GOODBYE MY LOVE, GOODBYE MY LOVE...
Belch

 

I WON'T SHARE YOU

I won't share you
I won't share you
with the drive and ambition
and the zeal I feel
this is my time
as the note I wrote
was read, she said
has the Perrier gone
straight to my head
or is life plainly sick and cruel, instead?
"YES!"
No-no-no-no-no-no
I won't share you
I won't share you
with the drive and the dreams inside
this is my time
Life tends to come and go
well, that's OK
just as long as you know
Life tends to come and go
well, that's OK
just as long as you know
I won't share you
I won't share you
with the drive and the dreams inside
this is my time, this is my time


THE QUEEN IS DEAD

Farewell to this lands cheerless marches
hemmed in like a boar between arches
her very Lowness with her head in a sling
Im truely sorry-but it sounds like a wonderful thing
dear Charles, dont you ever crave
to appear on the front of the Daily mail
dressed in your Mother's bridal veil?
So, I checked all the registered historical facts
and I was shocked into shame to discover
how Im the 18th pale descendent
of some, old queen or other
has the world changed, or have I changed?
has the world changed, or have I changed?
as some 9-year old tough peddles drugs
(I never even knew what drugs were)
And so, I broke into the Palace
with a sponge and a rusty spanner
she said: "Eh, I know you, and you cannot sing"
I said: "that's nothing -you should hear me play piano"
We can go for a walk where it's quiet and dry
and we can talk about precious things
but when you are tied to your mother's apron
not one talks about castration
We can go for a walk where it's quiet and dry
and we can talk about precious things
like love and law and poverty
these are the things that kill me
We can go for a walk where it's quiet and dry
and we can talk about precious things
but the rain that flattens my hair
theses are the things that kill me
Passed the Pub that saps your body
and the church who'll snatch your money
the Queen is dead, boys
and it's so lonely on a limb
Pass the Pub that wrecks your body
and the church-all they want is your money
the Queen is dead, boys`
you can trust me, boys
life is very long, when you're lonely
life is very long, when you're lonely...

 

PANIC

Panic on the streets of London
Panic on the streets of Birmingham
I wonder to myself
Could life ever be sane again
on the Leeds side-streets that you slip down
I wonder to myself
Hopes may rise on the Grasmeres
But Honey Pie, you're not safe here
So you run down
To the safety of the town
But there's Panic on the streets of Carlisle
Dublin, Dundee, Humberside
I wonder to myself
Burn down the Disco
Hang the blessed D.J.
Because the music that they constantly play
IT SAYS NOTHING TO ME ABOUT MY LIFE
Hang the blessed D.J.
Because the music they constantly play
On the Leeds side-streets that you slip down
On the provincial towns that you jog 'round
Hang the D.J.,. Hang the D.J.,.Hang the D.J...

 

VICAR IN A TUTU

I was minding mind business
lifting some lead off
the roof of the Holy Name church
it was worthwhile living a laughable life
just to set my eyes on a blistering sight
of a vicar in a tu-tu
he's not strange
he just wants to live his life this way
a scanty bit of a thing
with a decorative ring
that wouldn't cover the head of a child
as Rose collects the money in the cannister
who comes sliding down the bannister
the vicar in a tu-tu
he's not strange
he just wants to live his life this way
the monkish monsignor
with a head full of plaster
said "my man, get your vile soul dry-cleaned"
as Rose counts the money in the cannister
as natural as rain
he dances again
vicar in a tu-tu
The next day in the pulpit
with Freedom and Ease
combating ignoranca,dust and disease
as Rose counts the money in the cannister
as natural as rain
he dances again
the fabric of a tu-tu
any man could get us to
and I am a living sign.

 

ASK

Shyness is nice, but
Shyness can stop you
From doing all the things in life
That you'd like to
So, if there's something you'd like to try
ASK ME-I WON'T SAY "NO"-HOW COULD I?
Coyness is nice, but ,
Coyness can stop you
from saying all the things in
life that you want to
If there's something that you'd like to try
ASK ME-I WON'TSAY"NO"-HOW COULD I?
Spending warm, Summer days indoors
Writing fringhtening verse
To a buck-toothed girl in Luxembourg
ASK ME, ASK ME ,ASK ME, ASK ME, ASK ME ,ASK ME
Because if it's not Love
Then it's the Bomb
That will bring us together
Nature is a language-can't you read?
Nature is a language-can't you read?
ASK ME, ASK ME ,ASK ME, ASK ME, ASK ME ,ASK ME
Because if it's not Love
Then it's the Bomb
That will bring us together

 

MARIE'S THE NAME (HIS LATEST FLAME) / RUSHOLME RUFFIANS

Very old friend 
Came by today 
As he was telling everyone in town 
Of all the love that he'd just found 
And Marie's the name (of his latest flame) 
Talked and talked 
And I heard him say 
That she had the longest blackest hair 
Prettiest green eyes anywhere 
And Marie's the name (of his latest flame) 
The last night of the fair 
By the big wheel generator 
A boy is stabbed 
His money is grabbed 
And the air hangs heavy like a dulling wine 
She is Famous 
She is Funny 
An engagement ring 
Doesn't mean a thing 
To a mind consumed by brass (money), oh 
The last night of the fair 
From a seat on a whirling waltzer 
Her skirt ascends for a watching eye 
It's a hideous trait (on her mother's side)
From a seat on a whirling waltzer 
Her skirt ascends for a watching eye 
A hideous trait (on her mother's side) 
Then someone falls in love 
Someone's beaten up 
Someone's beaten up 
And the senses being dulled are mine 
And someone falls in love 
Someone's beaten up 
And the senses being dulled are mine 
This is the last night of the fair 
And the grease in the hair 
Of a speedway operator 
Is all a tremulous heart requires 
A schoolgirl is denied 
She said : "How quickly would I die 
If I jumped from the top of the parachutes ?"
This is the last night of the fair 
And the grease in the hair 
Of a speedway operator 
Is all a tremulous heart requires 
A schoolgirl is denied 
She said : "How quickly would I die 
Oh, if I jumped from the top of the parachutes ?"
...Oh, walk home alone 
I might walk home alone 
But my faith in love is still devout

 

THE BOY WITH THE THORN IN HIS SIDE

The boy with the thorn in his side
behind the hatred there lies
a murderous desire for love
how can they look into my eyes
and still they dont believe me
how can they hear me say those words
and still they dont believe me
and if they don't believe me now
will they ever believe me?
and if they don't believe me now
will they ever believe me?
The boy with the thorn in his side
behind the hatred there lies
a plundering desire for love
how can they see the Love in our eyes
and still they don't believe us
and after all this time
they don't want to believe us
and if they dont believe us now
will they ever believe us ?
andd when you want to Live
how do you start ?
where do you go ?
who do you know?

 

RUBBER RING / WHAT SHE SAID

Yeah! What she says : 
"How come someone hasn't noticed 
That I'm dead 
And decided to bury me ? 
God knows, I'm ready !"
La-la-la ... 
What she said was sad 
But then, all the rejection she's had 
To pretend to be happy 
Could only be idiocy 
La-la-la ... 
What she said was not for the job or 
Lover that she never had 
No no no ... 
What she read 
All heady books 
She'd sit and prophesise 
(It took a tattooed boy from 
Birkenhead 
To really really open her eyes)

IS IT REALLY SO STRANGE?

I left the North 
I travelled South 
I found a tiny house 
And I can't help the way I feel 
Oh yes, you can kick me 
And you can punch me 
And you can break my face 
But you won't change the way I feel 
'Cause I love you, Oh ... 
And is it really so strange ? 
Oh, is it really so strange ? 
Oh, is it really so, really so strange ? 
I say NO, you say YES 
(and you will change your mind) 
I left the South 
I travelled North 
I got confused - I killed a horse 
I can't help the way I feel 
Oh yes, you can punch me 
And you can butt me 
And you can break my spine 
But you won't change the way I feel 
'Cause I love you, Oh ... 
And is it really so strange ? 
Oh, is it really so strange ? 
Oh, is it really so, really so strange ? 
I say NO, you say YES 
(But you will change your mind) 
I left the North again 
I travelled South again 
And I got confused - I killed a nun 
I CAN'T HELP THE WAY I FEEL 
(I lost my bag in Newport Pagnell) 
Why is the last mile the hardest mile ? 
My throat was dry, with the sun in my eyes 
And I realised, I realised 
I could never 
I could never, never, never, go back home again

 

CEMETERY GATES

A dreaded sunny day
so I meet you at the cemetry gates
Keats and Yeats are on your side
A dreaded sunny day
so I meet you at the cemetry gates
Keats and Yeats are on your side
while Wilde is on mine
So we go inside and we gravely read the stones
all those people all those lives
where are they now ?
with loves, and hates
and passions just like mine
they were born
and then they lived and then they died
which seems so unfair
and I wantr to crv
You say: "ere thrice the sun hath done salutation to the dawn"
and you claim these words as your own
but Im well-read, have heard them said
a hundred times (maybe less, maybe more)
if you must write prose/poems
the words you use should be your own
dont plagiarise or take "on loans"
there's alweays someone, somewhere
with a big nose, who knows
and who trips you up and laughs
when you fall
You say: "ere long done do does did "
words which could only be your own
you then produce the text
from whence was ripped
(some dizzy whore, 1804)
A dreaded sunny day
so let's go where we're happy
so I meet you at the cemetry gates
Keats and Yeats are on your side
A dreaded sunny day
so let's go where we're wanted
so I meet you at the cemetry gates
Keats and Yeats are on your side
but you lose
because Wilde is on mine

 

LONDON

Smoke
Lingers 'round your fingers
Train
Heave on - to Euston
Do you think you've made
The right decision this time?
You left
Your tired family grieving
And you think they're sad because you're leaving
But didn't you see the Jealousy in the eyes
Of the ones who had to stay behind?
And do you think you've made
The right decision thins time?
You left
Your girlfriend on the platform
With thei really ragged notion that you'll return
But she knows
That when he goes
He really goes
So do you think you've made
The right decision this time?

 

I KNOW IT'S OVER

I can feel the soil falling over my head 
And as I climb into an empty bed 
Oh well. Enough said. 
I know it's over - still I cling 
I don't know where else I can go 
Over ... 
Oh Mother, I can feel the soil falling over my head 
See, the sea wants to take me 
The knife wants to cut me 
Do you think you can help me ? 
Sad veiled bride, please be happy 
Handsome groom, give her room 
Loud, loutish lover, treat her kindly 
(Though she needs you 
More than she loves you) 
And I know it's over - still I cling 
I don't know where else I can go 
Over, it's over, it's over, it's over 
It's over, la ... 
I know it's over 
And it never really began 
But in my heart it was so real
And you even spoke to me, and said : 
"If you're so funny 
Then why are you on your own tonight ? 
And if you're so clever 
Then why are you on your own tonight ? 
I know ... 
'Cause tonight - it's just like any other night 
That's why you're on your own tonight 
Your triumphs and your charms 
While they're in each other's arms..."
It's so easy to laugh 
It's so easy to hate 
It takes strength to be gentle and kind 
Over, over, over, over 
It's so easy to laugh 
It's so easy to hate 
It takes guts to be gentle and kind 
Over, over 
Love is Natural and Real 
But not for you, my love 
Not tonight, my love 
Love is Natural and Real 
But not for such as you and I, my love 
Oh Mother, I can feel the soil falling over my head...
Oh Mother, I can feel the soil fall over, fall over my head 
Oh Mother, I can feel the ... fall over my ... , Oh ...

 

THE DRAIZE TRAIN

A vastly superior version of the instrumental B-side, acting as a peace 
offering to Marr (Morrissey chose the tracks for the compilation, 
and of course, receives no royalties on this track).

 

STILL ILL

I decree today that life
is simply taking and not giving
England is mine and it owes me a living
ask me why, and I'll spit in your eye
ask me why, and I'll spit in your eye
but we cannot cling to the old dreams anymore
no, we cannot cling to the old dreams anymore
Does the body rule the mind
or does the mind rule the body?
I dunno...
Under the iron bridge we kissed
and although I ended up with sore lips
it just wasn't like the old days anymore
no, it wasn't like those days
am I still ill?
Does the body rule the mind
or does the mind rule the body ?
I dunno...
Ask me why, and I'll die
ask me why, and I'll die
and if you must go to work tomorrow
well, if I were you I wouldn't bother
for there are brighter sides to life
and I should know because I've seen them
but not very often...
under the iron bridge we kissed
and although I ended up with sore lips
it just wasn't like the old days anymore
no, it wasn't like those days
am I still ill?

 

BIGMOUTH STRIKES AGAIN

Sweetness, sweetness I was only joking
when I said Id like to smash every tooth
in your head
Sweetness, sweetness I was only joking
when I said by right s you should be
bludgeoned in your bed
and now I know how Joan of Arc felt
now I know how Joan of Arc felt
as the flames roseto her roman nose
and her Walkman stared to melt
Bibmouth, bigmouth
bigmouth strikes again
and Ive got no right to take my place
with the Human race
and now I know how Joan of Arc felt
now I know of Joan of Arc felt
as the flames rose to her roman nose
and her hearing aid started to melt
Bigmouth, bigmouth
bigmouth strikes again
and Ive got no right to take my place
with the Human race

 
ALSATIAN COUSTIN

Were you and he Lovers?
and would you say so if you were?
on a forecourt
on a Friday
passing my way
Were you and he Lovers?
and if you were, then say that you were!
on a groundsheet
under canvas
with your tent-flap
open wide
A note upon his desk:
"P.S. Bring Me Home And Have Me!"
Leather elbows on a tweed coat
- Oh! -
Is THAT the best you can do?
So came his reply:
"...but on the desk is where I want you!"
So I ask (even though I know):
were you and he Lovers?

 

LITTLE MAN, WHAT NOW?

An afternoon nostalgia
television show
you spoke in silhouette
(but they couldn't name you)
although the panel were
very polite to you
but I remembered you
from Friday nights 1969
ATV - you murdered every line
too old to be a child star
too young to take leads
four seasons passed
and they AXED you
nervously juvenile
(WON'T SMILE!)
What became of you?
did that swift eclipse torture you?
a star at eighteen
and then-suddenly gone
down to a few lines
in the back page of a teenage annual
oh but I remembered you
I looked up to you

 

EVERYDAY IS LIKE SUNDAY

Trudging slowly over wet sand
back to the bench
where your clothes were stolen
this is the coastal town
that they forgot to close down
Armageddon - come Armageddon!
Come Armageddon! Come!
Everyday is like Sunday
everyday is silent and grey
Hide on the promenade
scratch out a postcard
"how I dearly with I was not here"
in the seaside town
...that they forgot to bomb
Come! Come! Come - nuclear bomb!
Everyday is like Sunday
everyday is silent and grey
Trudging back over pebbles and sand
and a strange dust lands on your hands
(and on your face)
Everyday is like Sunday
"Win Yourself A Cheap Tray"
share some greased tea with me
everyday is silent and grey

 

BENGALI IN PLATFORMS

No no no
he does not want to depress you
oh no no no no no
he only wants to impress you
Bengali in platform
she only wants to embrace your culture
and to be your friend forever
Bengali, Bengali
oh shelve your Western plans
and understand that life is hard enough when you belong here
A silver-studded rim that glistens
and an ankle-star that...blinds me
a lemon sole so very high
which only reminds me, to tell you
so I break the news gently
I break the news to you gently
"Shelve your plans"
Bengali, Bengali
its the touchy march of time
that blinds you
don't blame me
don't hate me
just because I'm the one to tell you
that life is hard enough when you belong here
life is hard enough when you belong here
shelve your western plans
life is hard enough when you belong here

 

ANGEL, ANGEL, DOWN WE GO TOGETHER

Angel, Angel
don't take your life tonight
I know they take
and that they take in turn
and they give you nothing real
for yourself in return
and when they've used you
and they've broken you
and wasted all your money
and cast your shell aside
and when they've bought you
and they've sold you
and they've billed you for the pleasure
and they've made your parents cry
I will be here
BELIEVE ME
I will be here
...believe me
Angel, don't take your life
some people have got no pride
they do not understand
the Urgency of life
but I love you more than life
I love you more than life
I love you more than life
I love you more than life

 

LALE NIGHT, MAUDLIN STREET

The last night on Maudlin Street
goodbye house
goodbye stairs
I was born here
I was raised here, and
...I took some stick here
love at first sight
may sound trite
but it's true, you know
I could list the details
of everything you ever wore
or said, or how you stood that day
and as we spend the last night
on Maudlin Street, I say
"goodbye house-forever!"
I never stole a happy hour
around here
Where the world's ugliest boy
became what you see
here I am - the ugliest man
Its the last night on Maudlin Street
and truly I do love you
oh, truly I do love you
When I sleep with that picture of
you framed beside my bed
oh, it's childish and it's silly
but I think it's you in my room
by the bed (...yes, I told you it was silly...)
and I know
I took strange pills
but I never meant to hurt you
oh truly I love you
I came home late one night
everyone had gone to bed
nobody stays up for you
when you have sixteen stitches
all around your head
the last buss I missed to Maudlin Street
so, he drove me home in the Van
complaining: "Women only like me for my mind..."
don't leave your torch behind
power-cuts ahead
as we crept through the park
but no I cannot steal a pair of jeans
off a clothesline for you
but you...without clothes
oh I could not keep a straight face
me - without clothes?
well a nation turns its back and gags...
I'm packed
I am moving house
a half-life disappears today
every slag waves me on
(secretly wishing me gone
well, I will be soon
oh - I will be soon)
There were bad times on Maudlin Street
when they took you away in a police car
dear Inspector - don't you know?
don't you care?
don't you know - about Love?
Your gran died
and your mother died
on Maudlin Street
in pain and ashamed
with never time to say
those special things
I took the keys from Maudlin Street
well, it's only bricks and mortar!
and...truly I do love you
wherever you are
wherever you are

 

SUEDHEAD

Why do you come here
why do you hang around
I'm so sorry
I'm so sorry
Why do you come here
when you know it makes
things hard for me
when you know, oh
why do you come?
Why do you telephone?
and why send me silly notes?
I'm so sorry
I'm so sorry
why do you come here
when you know it makes
thing hard for me
when you know, oh
why do you come?
You had to sneak into my room
'just' to read my diary
was it just to see all the things
you knew I'd written about you?
and...so many illustrations
I'm so very sickened
oh, I am so sickened NOW

 

BREAK UP THE FAMILY

The strange logic of your clumsiest line
stayed emblazoned on my mind
break up the family
and lets begin to live our lives
I went to see all my friends tonight
it wasn't Youth, it wasn't even Life
born Old, sadly wise
resigned (well, we were)
to ending our lives
I'm so glad to grow older
to move away from those awful times
I want to see all my friends tonight
Yes you found love but you weren't
at peace with your life
home late, full of Hate
despise the ties that bind
oh I'm so glad to grow older
to move away from those younger years
now I'm in love for the first time
and I don't feel bad
Let me see all my old friends
let me put my arm around them
because I really do love them
now, does that sound mad?
Captain of games, solid framed
I stood on the touchline
hailstones, driven home
in his car - no breaks? I don't mind
I'm just so glad to grow older
to move away from those darker years
I'm in love for the first time
and I don't feel bad
so wish me luck my friends
goodbye

 

HAIRDRESSER ON FIRE

Here is London
here is London
is it home of the free,
or what?
can you squeeze me
into an empty page of your diary
and psychologically save me
I've got faith in you
I sense the power
in the fingers
within an hour the power
can totally destroy me
or it could same my life
here is London
'home of the brash, outrageous
and free'
you are repressed
but you're remarkably dressed
is it Real?
but you're far to busy
busy scissors
busy clippers
hair dresser on fire
all around Sloane Square
and you're far too busy
to see me
"busy,busy"
hairdresser on fire
was a client over-cautious
he made you nervous
and when he said
"I'm gonna sue you"
I really felt for you
so can you squeeze me
into an empty page of your diary
and supernaturally change me
CHANGE ME, CHANGE ME

 

THE ORDINARY BOYS

Ordinary boys, happy knowing nothing
happy being no one, but themselves
Ordinary girls, supermarket clothes
who think it's very clever to be cruel to you
for you were so different
you stood all alone
and you knew
that it had to be so
avoiding ordinary boys
happy going nowhere, just around here
in their rattling cars
and ordinary girls
never seeing further
than the cold, small streets
that trap them
but you were so different
you had to say no
when those empty fools
tried to change you, and claim you
for the lair of their ordinary world
where they feel so lucky
so lucky, so lucky
with their lives laid out before them
they're so lucky, so lucky
so lucky, so lucky

 

I DON'T MIND IF YOU FORGET ME

I don't mind
I don't mind if you forget me
having learned my lesson
I never left an impression on anyone
so now you send me your hardened 'regards'
when once you'd send me 'love'
sincerely I must tell you
your mild 'best wishes'
they make me suspicious
but I don't mind
I don't mind if you forget me
having learned my lesson
I never left
an impression on anyone
the pressure to change, to move on
was strange
and very strong
so this is why I tell you
I really do understand
BYE BYE
I don't mind if you forget me
no no no no no no no
REJECTION IS ONE THING
BUT REJECTION FROM A FOOL
IS CRUEL
REJECTION IS ONE THING
BUT REJECTION FROM A FOOL
IS CRUEL
and I don't mind if you forget me
I don't mind if your forget me

 

DIAL-A-CLICHE

Further into the fog I fall
well, I was just
following you!
when you said:
"Do as I do and scrap your fey ways"
(dial-a-cliche)
"grow up, be a man, and close your mealy-mouth!"
(dial-a-cliche)
But the person underneath
where does he go?
does he slide by the wayside?
or...does he just die?
when you find that you've organized
your feelings, for people
who didn't like you then
and certainly don't like you now
yet still you say:
"Do as I do and scrap your fey ways"
(dial-a-cliche)
"grow up, be a man, and close your mealy-mouth!"
(dial-a-cliche)
"the Safe way is the only way!
there's always time to change, son!"
yes well I've changed
but I'm in pain!
dial-a-chiche

 

MARGARET ON THE GUILLOTINE

The kind people
have a wonderful dream
Margaret on the guillotine
because people like you
make me feel so tired
when will you die?
when will you die?
when will you die?
when will you die?
when will you die?
because people like you
make me feel so old inside
please die
and kind people
do not shelter this dream
make it real
make the dream real
make the dream real
make it real

 

OUR FRANK

Our frank and open
deep conversations
they get me nowhere
they bring me down, so
give it a rest, won't you?
give me a cigarette
God give me patience
just no more conversation
Give us a drink
and make it quick
or else I'm gonna be sick
sick all over
your frankly vulgar
red pullover
now see how the colours blend
Our frank and open
deep conversations
they get me nowhere
they bring me down, so
give it a rest, won't you?
now will you just give over
the world may be ending
but look, I'm only human
Give us a drink
and make it quick
or else I'm gonna be sick
all over
your frankly vulgar
red pullover
now see how the two colours blend
Won't somebody stop me
from thinking all the time
about everything
so deeply
so bleakly

 

ASIAN RUT

Day oh so late
strangely the sun still shone
oh Asian boy
what are you on?
Day oh so late
strangely the sun still shone
what drugs are you on?
Tooled-up Asian boy
has come here to avenge
the cruel, cold killing
of his very best friend
Tooled-up Asian boy
has come here to take revenge
for the cruel, cold killing
of his only friend
Peace through the school
so quiet in the hall
it's a strange sign for one
of what's to come
Tough and hard and pale
oh they may just impale you on railings
oh English boys
it must be wrong
three against one?
Brakes slammed, and
a gun jammed, and
as far as I could tell
brave Asian boy
dealt a blow and fell
I'm just passing through here
on my way to somewhere civilised
and maybe I'll even arrive
maybe I'll even arrive?

 

SING YOUR LIFE

Sing your life
any fool can think of words that rhyme
many others do
why don't you?
do you want to?
Sing your life
just walk right up to the microphone
and name
all the things that you love
all the things that you loathe
sing your life
all the things that you love
all the things that you loathe
oh sing your life
oh sing your life
Others sang your life
but now's your chance to shine
and have the pleasure of
saying what you mean
the rare pleasure of
meaning what you sing
oh, make no mistake, my friend
all of this will end
so sing it now
all the things you love
all the things you loathe
oh sing your life
all the things that you love
all the things that you loathe
oh sing your, oh sing your
Don't leave it all unsaid
somewhere in the wasteland of your head
and make no mistake, my friend
your pointless life will end
but before you go
can you look at the truth?
You have a lovely singing voice
a lovely singing voice
and all of those
who sing on key
they stole the notion
from you and me

 

MUTE WITNESS

Your poor witness
crying so loudly on the floor
oh but she's only trying to tell you
what it was that she saw
she is only trying to tell you
what it was that she saw
Now see her standing on the table
with her small arms flailing
and you feel such compassion
in your soul for
Your poor mute witness
still testing the strength
of our patience
oh but she's only trying to tell you
what it was that she saw
Now see her pointing to the frisbee
with a memory too fuzzy
as her silent words
describe the fright of last night
4 a.m. Norhtside, Clapham Common
who knows what she was doing there?
will she sketch the answer later?
Well, I'll ask her
"now dry your tears, my dear"
Now see her mime in time so nicely
it would all have been so clear
is only she had never volunteered
"your taxi is here, my dear"

 

KING LEER

Your boyfriend, he
went down on one knee
well, could it be
he's only got one knee?
I tried to surprise you
with Vodka
or, Tizer
I can't quite remember
but you didn't thank me
you didn't even thank me
because you never do
Your boyfriend, he
has the gift of the gab
or, could it be
the gift of the grab?
I tried to surprise you
I lay down beside you
and...nothing much happened
and you didn't phone me
you didn't even phone me
because it's not your style
to dial
Your boyfriend, he
displays to me
more than just
a hint of cruelty
I tried to surprise you
I crept up behind you
with a homeless chihuahua
you gushed for an hour
you handed him back and said
"You'll never guess
I'm bored now"

 

FOUND FOUND FOUND

found found found found found found
someone who's worth it
in this murkiness
someone who's never
seeming scheming
found found found found found found
someone who's worth it
in this murkiness
someone who's never
seeming scheming
Oh, but if I'd never found
oh, but if I'd never found
oh, but if I'd never found
I do believe that
the more you give your love
and I do believe that
the more you offer trust
the more you chase
the more you cry
the more you're bound to lose
the more you're bound to lose
Oh, but if I'd never found
oh, but if I'd never found
somebody
who wants to be
who wants to be
with me
all the time

 

DRIVING YOUR GIRLFRIEND HOME

I'm driving
your girlfriend home
and she's saying
how she never chose you
"turn left", she says
so I turn left
and she says
"So how did I end up
so deeply involved in
the very existence
I planned on avoiding?"
and I can't answer
I'm driving
your girlfriend home
and she's laughing
to stop herself crying
"drive on", she says
so I drive on
and she says
"So how did I end up
attached to this person
when his sense of humour
gets gradually worser?"
and I can't tell her
I'm parking
outside her home
and we're shaking hands
goodnight, so politely

 

THE HARSH TRUTH OF THE CAMERA EYE

Churchillian legs
hair barely there
the harsh truth of the camera eye
Your eyes signal pain
because of the strain
of smiling
the harsh truth of the camera eye
telling you all
that you never wnated to know
showing what
you didn't want shown
My so friendly lens
zooms into
"the inner you"
and it tells the harsh truth
and nothing but
Laugh with us all here
that's if you can
then take the pictures home
and screamtelling you all
that you never wanted to know
showing you what
you didn't want shown
This photographer
he must have really had it in for you
"Oh, I don't want
to be judged anymore
I don't wnat to be judged
I would sooner be Loved
I would sooner be
just blindly Loved..."

 

(I'M) THE END OF THE FAMILY LINE

With no complications
fifteen generations
(of mine)
all honouring Nature
until I arrive
(with incredible style)
I'm the end fo the line
the end of the family line
the end of the line
No baby pulled screaming
out into this seething whirl
by chance or whim
(or even love?)
our family tree hacked into decline
and I'm spared the pain
of ever saying
("goodbye")
I'm the end of the line
the end of the family line
the end of the line

 

THERE'S A PLACE IN HELL FOR ME AND MY FRIENDS

There is a place
reserved
for me and my friends
and when we go
we all will go
so you see
I'm never alone
there is a place
with a bit more time
and a few more
gentler words
and looking back
we do forgive
(we had no choice
we always did)
all that we hope
is that when we go
our skin
and our blood
and our bones
don't get in your way
making you ill
the way they did
when we lived
There is a place
a place in hell
reserved
for me and my friends
and if ever I
wanted to cry
then I will
because I can

 

TONY THE PONY

Still drinking on the corner 
Just don't say I didn't warn you 
Always nagging big brother 
He's only looking out for you 
Tony The Pony 
Tony The Pony 
You're still standing on the corner 
Just don't say I didn't warn you 
Old and jealous big brother 
You had your time and you spent it 
Crying 
Now, Tony The Pony 
Tony The Pony 
So, that's what they call you now ? 
When you're free outside 
So cold and hard and in control 
And ... 
There's a free ride on 
Tony The Pony 
Oh, why do you always wanna stop me 
From doing the things in life that make me happy ? 
And when I'm outside with friends, laughing loudly 
Why do you always wanna stop me ? 
Oh, I would never 
I would never 
But you will carry the can for anyone 
The free ride on 
Gullible Tony 
You're drunker quicker 
And you're sicker even quicker 
For something heavy is gonna fall on you 
Oh ... 
And what do they call you now ? 
When you're free outside 
So cold and hard and in control 
And, oh ... been a lark 
There's a free ride on 
Fucked-up Tony 
I will never say I told you so 
Or how I knew that something bad 
Would happen to you 
I don't wanna say I told you so 
Oh, but Tony, I told you so !!! 
I told you so

 

YOU'RE GONNA NEED SOMEONE ON YOUR SIDE

With the world's fate 
Resting on your shoulder 
You're gonna need 
Someone on your side 
You can't do it by yourself 
Any longer 
You're gonna need 
Someone on your side 
Someone kindly told me 
That you'd wasted 
Eight of nine lives
Oh, give yourself a break 
Before you break down 
You're gonna need someone on your side 
And here I am, And here I am 
Well, you don't need 
To look so pleased ! 
Day or night, 
There is no difference 
You're gonna need someone on your side 
Day or night, 
There is no difference 
You're gonna need someone soon 
And here I am, And here I am 
Well, you don't need 
To look so pleased

 

GLAMOROUS GLUE

First day with the jar 
You find 
Everyone lies 
First day with the jar 
You find 
Everyone lies, nobody minds 
Everyone lies 
Where is the man you respect ? 
And where is the woman you love ? 
Where's the woman you love ? 
Third week with the jar
You find 
Everything dies 
We won't vote Conservative 
Because we never have 
Everyone lies, everyone lies 
Where is the man you respect ? 
And where is the woman you love ? 
Where's the woman you love ? 
Everything of worth 
On Earth Is there To share 
I used to dream, and I used to vow 
I wouldn't dream of it now 
We look to Los Angeles 
For the language we use 
London is dead, London is dead, London is dead...
Now I'm too much in love 
I'm too much in love 
I know 
I'll go 
Empty hand 
From the land

 

WE'LL LET YOU KNOW

How sad are we ? 
And how sad have we been ? 
We'll let you know 
We'll let you know 
Oh, but only if - you're really interested 
You wonder how 
We've stayed alive 'till now 
We'll let you know 
We'll let you know 
But only if - you're really interested 
We're all smiles 
Then, honest, I swear, it's the turnstiles 
That make us hostile 
Oh ... 
We will descend 
On anyone unable to defend 
Themselves 
Oh ... 
And the songs we sing 
They're not supposed to mean a thing 
La, la, la, la ... 
Oh ...You're lonely, Oh ... you're lonely, Oh ... 
GET OFF THE ROOF ! Oh ... 
Your Arsenal !
We may seem cold, or 
We may even be 
The most depressing people you've ever known 
At heart, what's left, we sadly know 
That we are the last truly British people you'll ever know 
We are the last truly British people you will ever know 
You'll never never want to know

 

THE NATIONAL FRONT DISCO

David, the wind blows 
The wind blows ... 
Bits of your life away 
Your friends all say ... 
"Where is our boy ? Oh, we've lost our boy" 
But they should know 
Where you've gone 
Because again and again you've explained that 
You're going to ... 
Oh, you're going to ... 
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah 
England for the English ! 
England for the English ! 
David, the winds blow 
The winds blow ...
All of my dreams away 
And I still say : 
"Where is our boy ? Ah, we've lost our boy" 
But I should know 
Why you've gone 
Because again and again you've explained
You've gone to the ... 
National, ah ... 
To the National .. 
There's a country; you don't live there 
But one day you would like to 
And if you show them what you're made of 
Oh, then you might do ... 
But David, we wonder 
We wonder if the thunder 
Is ever really gonna begin 
Begin, begin 
Your mom says : 
"I've lost my boy" 
But she should know 
Why you've gone 
Because again and again you've explained 
You've gone to the : 
National 
To the National 
To the National Front Disco 
Because you want the day to come sooner 
You want the day to come sooner 
You want the day to come sooner 
When you've settled the score 
Oh, the National 
Oh, the National

 

CERTAIN PEOPLE I KNOW

I take the cue from 
Certain people I know 
I use the cue 
And then I 
Hand it on to you 
And when I swing it 
So, it catches his eye ... 
(Weren't you there ? 
- You'd have died !) 
I trust the views of 
Certain people I know 
They look at Danger 
And they 
LAUGH THEIR HEADS OFF 
Their clothes are Imitation 
George the 23rd 
(Don't you find this absurd ?) 
I'd hate to be like 
Certain people I know 
They break their necks 
And can't afford to
Get them fixed 
Ah, they'd sacrifice all 
Of their principles for 
anything cashable 
I do believe it's terrible 
Oh, wo, wo, Ah, ah, ah, ah, Oh, wo, wo...

 

WE HATE IT WHEN OUR FRIENDS BECOME SUCCESSFUL

We hate it when our friends become successful 
We hate it when our friends become successful 
Oh, look at those clothes 
Now look at that face, it's so old 
And such a video ! 
Well, it's really laughable 
Ha, ha, ha ...
We hate it when our friends become successful 
And if they're Northern, that makes it even worse
And if we can destroy them 
You bet your life we will 
Destroy them 
If we can hurt them 
Well, we may as well ... 
It's really laughable 
Ha, ha, ha ... 
You see, it should've been me 
It could've been me 
Everybody knows 
Everybody says so 
They say : 
"Ah, you have loads of songs 
So many songs 
More songs than they'd stand 
Verse 
Chorus 
Middle eight 
Break, fade 
Just listen ..."
La, la-la, la-la

SEASICK, YET STILL DOCKED

I am a poor freezingly cold soul 
So far from where 
I intended to go 
Scavenging through life's very constant lulls 
So far from where I'm determined to go 
Wish I knew the way to reach the one I love
There is no way ... 
Wish I had the charm to attract the one I love 
But you see, I've got no charm 
Mmm...
Tonight I've consumed much more than I can hold 
Oh, this is very clear to you 
And you can tell I have never really loved 
You can tell, by the way, I sleep all day
And all of my life no-one gave me anything 
No-one has ever given me anything 
My love is as sharp as a needle in your eye 
You must be such a fool 
To pass me by

 

I KNOW IT'S GONNA HAPPEN SOMEDAY

My love, wherever you are 
Whatever you are 
Don't lose faith 
I know it's gonna happen someday 
To you 
Please wait ... Please wait ... Oh ... Wait ... 
Don't lose faith 
You say that the day just never arrives 
And it's never seemed so far away 
Still, I know it's gonna happen someday 
To you 
Please wait ... 
Don't lose faith

 

TOMORROW

Tomorrow 
Will it really come ? 
And if it does come 
Will I still be Human ? 
All I ask of you is one thing that you never do 
Would you put your arms around me ? 
(I won't tell anyone) 
Tomorrow 
Does it have to come ?
All I ask of you is one thing that you'll never do 
Would you put your arms around me ? 
(I won't tell anybody) 
Tomorrow 
And what must come before ...
Oh, the pain in my arms 
Oh, the pain in my legs 
Ooh, my shiftless body 
Tomorrow 
It's surely nearer now ? 
You don't think I'll make it 
I never said I wanted to ! 
Well did I ? 
Oh, the pain in my arms 
Oh, the pain in my legs 
Oh, yeah; oh, yeah, No, yeah; no, yeah 
Through my shiftless body 
Tomorrow, Tomorrow 
All I ask of you ... oh ... 
Is : would you tell me that you love me 
Tell me, tell me that you love me, Tell me, tell me that you love me ... 
Ah, I know you don't mean it 
Ah, I know you don't mean it 
Tell me, tell me that you love me, Tell me, tell me that you love me ...

NOVEMBER SPAWNED A MONSTER

Sleep on and dream of Love
because it's the closest you will get to love
poor twisted child, so ugly, so ugly
poor twisted child, oh hug me, oh hug me
one November spawned a monster 
in the shape of this child who later cried
"But Jesus made me, so Jesus save me from
pity, sympathy and people discussing me"
a frame of useless limbs what can make GOOD
all the BAD that's been done?
And if the lights were out
could you even bear
to kiss her full on the mouth (or anywhere?)
poor twisted child, so ugly, so ugly
poor twisted child, oh hug me, oh hug me
one November spawned a monster 
in the shape of this child who must remain
a hostage to kindess and the wheels underneath her
a hostage to kindess and the wheels underneath her
a symbol of where mad, mad lovers
must PAUSE and draw the line
So sleep and dream of love
because it's the closest
you will get to love
that November is a time which I must put OUT of my mind
oh one fine day 
LET IT BE SOON
she won't be rich or beautiful
but she'll be walking your streets
in the clothes that she went out
and chose for herself

 

SEASICK, YET STILL DOCKED

I am a poor freezingly cold soul 
So far from where 
I intended to go 
Scavenging through life's very constant lulls 
So far from where I'm determined to go 
Wish I knew the way to reach the one I love
There is no way ... 
Wish I had the charm to attract the one I love 
But you see, I've got no charm 
Mmm...
Tonight I've consumed much more than I can hold 
Oh, this is very clear to you 
And you can tell I have never really loved 
You can tell, by the way, I sleep all day
And all of my life no-one gave me anything 
No-one has ever given me anything 
My love is as sharp as a needle in your eye 
You must be such a fool 
To pass me by

 

THE LOOP

I just wanna say 
I haven't been away 
I'm still right here 
Where I always was 
So one day, if you're bored 
By all means call 
Because you can do 
(But only if you want to) 
I just wanna say 
I haven't been away 
I am still right here 
Where I always was 
So one day, when you're bored 
By all means call 
Because you can do 
But you might not get through

 

SISTER I'M A POET

All over this town 
Yes, a low wind may blow 
And I can see through everybo... 
With no reason 
To hide these words I feel 
And no reason 
To talk about the books I read 
But still I do 
That's 'cause I'm a ... Sister I'm a ... 
All over this town 
Along this way 
Outside the prison gates 
I love the romance of crime 
And I wonder 
Does anybody feel the way I do ? 
And is evil just something you are 
Or something you do ? 
Sister I'm a ... Sister I'm a ... 
All over this town, All over this town 
They pull over 
In their Citroen vans 
Not to shake your hand 
With meths on their breaths 
And you with youth on your side 
A plastic bag stranded at the lights 
This once was me ...
But now I'm a ... Sister I'm a ...
All over this town ... Oh, oh, oh 
All over this town, All over this town, Oh ... 
I still cannot speak French ... I am very lazy

 

JACK THE RIPPER

Oh, you look so tired 
Mouth slack and wide 
Ill-housed and ill-advised 
Your face is as mean 
As your life has been 
Crash into my arms 
I WANT YOU 
You don't agree -
But you don't refuse 
I know you 
And I know a place 
Where no one is likely to pass 
Oh, you don't care if it's late 
And you don't care if you're lost 
And oh, you look so tired 
(But tonight you presumed too much) 
Too much, too much 
And if it's the last 
Thing I ever do 
I'M GONNA GET YOU 
Crash into my arms 
I WANT YOU 
You don't agree -
But you don't refuse 
I know you 
And no one knows a thing about my life 
I can come and go as I please 
And if I want to, I can stay 
Oh, or if I want to, I can leave 
Nobody knows me, Nobody knows me, Nobody knows me Oh, oh...

 

SUCH A LITTLE THING MAKES SUCH A BIG DIFFERENCE

Such a little thing, such a little thing
but the difference it made was grave
there you go
wielding a bicycle chain
oh why won't you change
cange and be nicer?
such a little thing
a gentle tone of kindness
or written words on paper
- can you write?
How I love all of
the very simple things of life
(God's good air)
how I love all of
the very simple things of life
such a little thing
a fumbling politeness
the difference it saved me
wielding a bicycle chain
"I WILL NOT CHANGE AND I WILL NOT BE NICE"
Most people keep their brains between your legs (don't you find?)
Leave me alone - I was only singing, leave me alone because
I was only singing
leave me alone - I was only singing, leave me alone
you have just proved (again)
MOST PEOPLE KEEP THEIR BRAINS BETWEEN THEIR LEGS

 

I KNOW IT'S GONNA HAPPEN SOMEDAY

My love, wherever you are 
Whatever you are 
Don't lose faith 
I know it's gonna happen someday 
To you 
Please wait ... 
Please wait ... 
Oh ... Wait ... 
Don't lose faith 
You say that the day just never arrives 
And it's never seemed so far away 
Still, I know it's gonna happen someday 
To you 
Please wait ... 
Don't lose faith

 

WE'LL LET YOU KNOW

How sad are we ? 
And how sad have we been ? 
We'll let you know, We'll let you know 
Oh, but only if - you're really interested 
You wonder how 
We've stayed alive 'till now 
We'll let you know, We'll let you know 
But only if - you're really interested 
We're all smiles 
Then, honest, I swear, it's the turnstiles 
That make us hostile 
Oh ... We will descend 
On anyone unable to defend 
Themselves 
Oh ... And the songs we sing 
They're not supposed to mean a thing 
La, la, la, la ... Oh ...
You're lonely, Oh ... you're lonely 
Oh ... 
GET OFF THE ROOF !
Oh ... Your Arsenal !
We may seem cold, or 
We may even be 
The most depressing people you've ever known 
At heart, what's left, we sadly know 
That we are the last truly British people you'll ever know 
We are the last truly British people you will ever know 
You'll never never want to know

 

SUEDHEAD

Why do you come here
why do you hang around
I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry
Why do you come here
when you know it makes
things hard for me
when you know, oh
why do you come?
Why do you telephone?
and why send me silly notes?
I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry
why do you come here
when you know it makes
thing hard for me
when you know, oh
why do you come?
You had to sneak into my room
'just' to read my diary
was it just to see all the things
you knew I'd written about you?
and...so many illustrations
I'm so very sickened
oh, I am so sickened NOW

 

HE KNOWS I'D LOVE TO SEE HIM

He Knows (he knows)
Or, I think he does
because when I lived
in the Arse of the world...
he knows, he knows, he knows I'd love
to see him happy (or as close as is allowed)
because when I lived
in the Arse of the world
he knows, he knows, he knows I'd love
to see him happy (or as close as possible
as close as possible, as close as is allowed)
My name still conjours up deadly deeds
and a bad taste in the mouth
the police - they actually knew me
they said:
"You're just another person in the world
you're just another fool with radical views
you're just another who has maddening views
you want to turn it on its head
by staying in bed!"
I said: "I know I do"

 

YOU'RE GONNA NEED SOMEONE ON YOUR SIDE

With the world's fate 
Resting on your shoulder 
You're gonna need 
Someone on your side 
You can't do it by yourself 
Any longer 
You're gonna need 
Someone on your side 
Someone kindly told me 
That you'd wasted 
Eight of nine lives
Oh, give yourself a break 
Before you break down 
You're gonna need someone on your side 
And here I am, And here I am 
Well, you don't need 
To look so pleased ! 
Day or night, 
There is no difference 
You're gonna need someone on your side 
Day or night, 
There is no difference 
You're gonna need someone soon 
And here I am, And here I am 
Well, you don't need 
To look so pleased

 

GLAMOROUS GLUE

First day with the jar 
You find 
Everyone lies 
First day with the jar 
You find 
Everyone lies, nobody minds, Everyone lies 
Where is the man you respect ? 
And where is the woman you love ? 
Where's the woman you love ? 
Third week with the jar
You find 
Everything dies 
We won't vote Conservative 
Because we never have 
Everyone lies, everyone lies 
Where is the man you respect ? 
And where is the woman you love ? 
Where's the woman you love ? 
Everything of worth 
On Earth, Is there, To share 
I used to dream, and I used to vow 
I wouldn't dream of it now 
We look to Los Angeles 
For the language we use 
London is dead, London is dead, London is dead, ...
Now I'm too much in love 
I'm too much in love, 
I know I'll go 
Empty hand 
From the land

 

WE HATE IT WHEN OUR FRIENDS BECOME SUCCESSFUL

We hate it when our friends become successful 
We hate it when our friends become successful 
Oh, look at those clothes 
Now look at that face, it's so old 
And such a video ! 
Well, it's really laughable 
Ha, ha, ha ...
We hate it when our friends become successful 
And if they're Northern, that makes it even worse
And if we can destroy them 
You bet your life we will 
Destroy them 
If we can hurt them 
Well, we may as well ... 
It's really laughable 
Ha, ha, ha ... 
You see, it should've been me 
It could've been me 
Everybody knows 
Everybody says so 
They say : 
"Ah, you have loads of songs 
So many songs 
More songs than they'd stand 
Verse 
Chorus 
Middle eight 
Break, fade 
Just listen ..."
La, la-la, la-la

 

NOW MY HEART IS FULL

There's gonna be some trouble 
A whole house will need re-building 
And everyone I love in the house 
Will recline on an analyst's couch quite 
Soon 
Your Father cracks a joke 
And in the usual way 
Empties the room 
Tell all of my friends 
(I don't have too many 
Just some rain-coated lovers' puny brothers)
Dallow, Spicer, Pinkie, Cubitt 
Rush to danger 
Wind up nowhere 
Patric Doonan - raised to wait 
I'm tired again, I've tried again, and 
Now my heart is full 
Now my heart is full 
And I just can't explain 
So I won't even try to
Dallow, Spicer, Pinkie, Cubitt 
Every jammy Stressford poet 
Loafing oafs in all-night chemists 
Loafing oafs in all-night chemists 
Underact - express depression 
Ah, but Bunnie I loved you 
I was tired again 
I've tried again, and 
Now my heart is full 
Now my heart is full 
And I just can't explain 
So I won't even try to 
Could you pass by ? 
Could you pass by ? 
Oh ... 
Now my heart is full 
Now my heart is full 
And I just can't explain 
So ... slow ... 
Slow ... slow ... slow ... slow ... slow ...

 

SPRING-HEELED JIM

Spring-heeled Jim winks an eye 
He'll "do", he'll never be "done to" 
He takes on whoever flew through 
"Well, it's the normal thing to do" ... ah ... 
Spring-heeled Jim lives to love 
Now kissing with his mouth full 
And his eyes on some other fool 
So many women 
His head should be spinning 
Ah, but no ! 
Ah, but no ! 
But no !
Ah, no !
Spring-heeled Jim slurs the words : 
"There's no need to be so knowing
Take life at five times the 
Average speed, like I do" 
Until Jim feels the chill 
"Oh, where did all the time go ?" 
Once always in for the kill 
Now it's too cold 
And he feels too 
old 
Too old
Mmm, old... 
La, la, la, la-la, la ...

 

BILLY BUDD

Say, Billy Budd 
So you think you should ? 
Oh, everyone's laughing 
Say, Billy Budd 
So you think that you should ? 
Everyone's laughing ! 
Since I took up with you 
Things have been bad 
Yeah, but now it's 12 years on 
Now it's 12 years on 
Yes, and I took up with you 
I took my job application 
Into town 
Did you hear ? They turned me down 
Yes, and it's all because of us 
Oh, and what was in our eyes 
Oh, what was in our eyes, yeah 
I said, Billy Budd 
I would happily lose 
Both of my legs 
I would lose both of my legs 
Oh, if it meant you could be free 
Oh, if it meant you could be free 
(Don't leave us in the dark!)

 

HOLD ON TO YOUR FRIENDS

A bond of trust 
Has been abused 
Something of value 
May be lost 
Give up your job 
Squander your cash - be rash 
Just hold on to your friends 
There are more than enough 
To fight and oppose 
Why waste good time 
Fighting the people you like 
Who will fall defending your name 
Oh, don't feel so ashamed 
To have friends 
But now you only call me 
When you're feeling depressed 
When you feel happy I'm 
So far from your mind 
My patience is stretched 
My loyalty vexed 
Oh, you're losing all of your friends 
Hold on to your friends 
Hold on to your friends 
Resist - or move on 
Be mad, be rash 
Smoke and explode 
Sell all of your clothes 
Just bear in mind : 
Oh, there just might come a time 
When you need some friends

 

THE MORE YOU IGNORE ME, THE CLOSER I GET

The more you ignore me 
The closer I get 
You're wasting your time 
The more you ignore me 
The closer I get 
You're wasting your time 
I will be 
In the bar 
With my head 
On the bar 
I am now 
A central part 
Of your mind's landscape 
Whether you care 
Or do not 
Yeah, I've made up your mind 
The more you ignore me 
The closer I get 
You're wasting your time 
The more you ignore me 
The closer I get 
You're wasting your time 
Beware !
I bear more grudges 
Than lonely high court judges 
When you sleep 
I will creep 
Into your thoughts 
Like a bad debt 
That you can't pay 
Take the easy way 
And give in 
Yeah, and let me in 
Oh, let me in 
Oh let me ... 
Oh, let me in 
IT'S WAR 
IT'S WAR 
WAR 
WAR 
Oh, let me in 
Ah, the closer I get 
Ah, you're asking for it 
Ah, the closer I get 
Ooh, the closer I ...

 

WHY DON'T YOU FIND OUT FOR YOURSELF

The sanest days are mad 
Why don't you find out for yourself ? 
Then you'll see the price 
Very closely 
Some men here 
They have a special interest 
In your career 
They wanna help you to grow 
And then syphon all your dough 
Why don't you find out for yourself ? 
Then you'll see the glass 
Hidden in the grass 
You'll never believe me, so 
Why don't you find out for yourself ? 
Sick down to my heart 
That's just the way it goes 
Some men here 
They know the full extent of 
Your distress 
They kneel and pray 
And they say : 
"Long may it last" 
Why don't you find out for yourself ?
Then you'll see the glass 
Hidden in the grass 
Bad scenes come and go 
For which you must allow 
Sick down to my heart 
That's just the way it goes 
Don't rake up my mistakes 
I know exactly what they are 
And ... what do YOU do ? 
Well ... you just SIT THERE 
I've been stabbed in the back 
So many many times 
I don't have any skin 
But that's just the way it goes

 

I AM HATED FOR LOVING

I am hated for loving 
I am hated for loving 
Anonymous call, a poison pen 
A brick in the small of the back again 
I still don't belong 
To anyone - I am mine 
And I am hated for loving 
I am haunted for wanting 
Anonymous call, a poison pen 
A brick in the ... ah ... 
A brick in the small of the back again 
I still don't belong 
To anyone - I am mine 
I am falling 
With no-one to catch me 
I am falling 
And there's still 
No-one to catch me 
Ah .. 
Anonymous call, a poison pen 
A brick in the ... ah ... 
A brick in the small of the back again 
I just don't belong 
To anywhere 
I just don't belong 
Mmm ... 
Ah ...

 

LIFEGUARD SLEEPING, GIRL DROWNING

Always looking for attention 
Always needs to be mentioned 
Who does she 
Think she should be ? 
The shrill cry through darkening air 
Doesn't she know he's 
Had such a busy day ? 
Tell her ... sshhh
Somebody tell her ... sshhh 
Slowest ... 
It was only a test 
But she swam too far 
Against the tide 
She deserves all she gets 
The sky became marked with stars 
As an out-stretched arm slowly 
Disappears 
Hooray 
Oh hooray 
No, oh, oh, woh, there's no movement 
No, oh, hooray 
Oh, hooray 
Please don't worry 
There'll be no fuss 
She was ... nobody's nothing 
(What's your name ?) 
When he awoke 
The sea was calm 
And another day passes like a dream 
There's no ... no way 
(What's your name ?)

 

USED TO BE A SWEET BOY

Used to be a sweet boy 
Holding so tightly 
To Daddy's hand 
But that was all 
In some distant land 
Blazer and tie 
And a big bright healthy smile 
Used to make all 
Of our trials worthwhile 
Used to be a sweet boy 
And I'm not to blame 
Something went wrong 
And I know 
I'm not to blame 
Something went wrong 
Can't be to blame 
Ah ...

 

THE LAZY SUNBATHERS

A world war 
Was announced 
Days ago 
But they didn't know 
The lazy sunbathers 
The lazy sunbathers 
The sun burns through 
To the planet's core 
And it isn't enough 
They want more 
Nothing 
Appears 
To be 
Between the ears of 
The lazy sunbathers 
Too jaded 
To question stagnation 
The sun burns through 
To the planet's core 
And it isn't enough 
They want more 
Religions fall 
Children shelled 
"...Children shelled ? That's all 
Very well, but would you 
Please keep the noise 
Down low ? 
Because you're waking 
The lazy sunbathers ..."
Oh, the lazy sunbathers 
The lazy sunbathers

 

SPEEDWAY

And when you slam 
Down the hammer 
Can you see it in your heart ? 
All of the rumours 
Keeping me grounded 
I never said, I never said that they were 
Completely unfounded 
So when you slam 
Down the hammer 
Can you see it in your heart ? 
Can you delve so low ? 
And when you're standing 
On my fingers 
Can you see it in your heart ? ... ah ... 
And when you try 
To break my spirit 
It won't work 
Because there's nothing left to break 
Anymore 
All of the rumours 
Keeping me grounded 
I never said, I never said that they were 
Completely unfounded 
You won't sleep 
Until the earth that wants me 
Finally has me 
Oh you've done it now 
You won't rest 
Until the hearse that becomes me 
Finally takes me 
Oh you've done it now 
And you won't smile 
Until my loving mouth 
Is shut good and proper 
FOREVER 
All of the rumours 
Keeping me grounded 
I never said, I never said that they were 
Completely unfounded 
And all those lies 
Written lies, twisted lies 
Well, they weren't lies 
They weren't lies 
They weren't lies 
I never said 
I never said 
I could have mentioned your name 
I could have dragged you in 
Guilt by implication 
By association 
I've always been true to you 
In my own strange way 
I've always been true to you 
In my own sick way 
I'll always stay true to you

 

THE TEACHERS ARE AFRAID OF THE PUPILS

There's too many people 
Planning your downfall 
When your spirit's on trial 
These nights can be frightening 
Sleep transports sadness 
To some other mid-brain 
And somebody here 
Will not be here next year 
So you stand by the board 
Full of fear and intention 
And, if you think that they're listening 
Well, you've got to be joking 
Oh, you understand change 
And you think it's essential 
But when your profession 
Is humiliation 
Say the wrong word to our children ...
We'll have you, oh yes, we'll have you 
Lay a hand on our children 
And it's never too late to have you 
Mucus on your collar 
A nail up through the staff chair 
A blade in your soap 
And you cry into your pillow 
To be finished would be a relief 
To be finished would be a relief... 
Say the wrong word to our children ...
We'll have you, oh yes, we'll have you 
Lay a hand on our children 
And it's never too late to have you 
To be finished would be a relief 
To be finished would be a relief...
I'm very glad this thing has come 
Sometimes I'm so glad 
Never bother to play the tunes 
I've seen it coming for dear life

 

READER MEET AUTHOR

You don't know a thing about their lives 
They live where you wouldn't dare to drive
You shake as you think of how they sleep 
But you write as if you are my side-by-side 
Reader, meet Author 
With the hope of hearing sense 
But you may be feeling let down 
By the words of defence 
He says : "No-one ever sees me when I cry"
You don't know a thing about their lives 
Books don't save them, books aren't Stanley knives 
And if a fight broke out here tonight 
You'd be the first away, because you're that type 
And the Year 2000 won't change anyone here 
As each fabled promise flies so fast 
You'll swear it was never there 
Oh, have you ever escaped from a shipwrecked life ? 
So safely with your software; all miles from the front line 
You hear the way their sad voices, and you start to imagine things 
Oh, any excuse to write more lies

 

THE BOY RACER

He's just too good-natured and 
He's got too much money and 
He's got too many girlfriends 
I'm jealous, that's all 
Have you seen him go, though, oh ? 
Have you seen him go, though, oh ? 
Boy racer, Boy racer, oh

Boy racer, Boy racer, oh 
We're gonna kill this pretty thing 
Boy racer, Boy racer, oh 
We're gonna kill this pretty thing 
He thinks he got the whole world in his hands 
Stood at the urinal 
He thinks he got the whole world in his hands 
And I'm gonna ... kill him !
Oh, no ! Oh, no ! Oh, no ! Oh, no ! Oh, no !Oh .... 
Boy racer Boy racer, oh 
We're gonna kill this pretty thing...
He's just too good-looking, and, And, and ... 
Boy racer Boy racer, oh

THE OPERATION

You fight with your right hand 
And caress with your left hand 
Everyone I know is sick to death of you 
With a tear that's a mile wide 
In the kite that you're flying 
Everyone I know is sick to death of you 
Ever since 
You don't look the same 
You're just not the same, no way 
You say clever things and 
You never used to 
You don't catch what I'm saying 
When you're deafened to advice 
Everyone here is sick to the 
Back teeth of you 
With a tear that's a mile wide 
In the kite that you're flying 
Everyone here is sick to the 
Tattoo of you 
Ever since 
You don't look the same 
You're just not the same, no way 
You say pleasant things and 
There is no need to
Still, you fight with your right hand 
And caress with your left hand 
Ooh, ooh ... Sad to say ... 
How once I was in love with you 
Sad to say ... 
You don't catch what I'm saying 
When you're deafened to advice 
Ooh, ooh ... Ever since 
You don't look the same 
You're just not the same, no way 
What the hell have 
They stuck into you ?

 

DAGENHAM DAVE

Head in the clouds, and a mouthful of pie 
Head in a blouse, everybody loves him 
I see why 
Dagenham Dave, Dagenham Dave, Oh, Dagenham Dave 
Dagenham Dave, Dagenham Dave, Oh, Dagenham Dave 
"I love Karen, I love Sharon" on the windowscreen 
With never the need to fight or to question a single thing 
Dagenham Dave, Dagenham Dave Oh, Dagenham Dave 
Dagenham Dave, Dagenham Dave Oh, Dagenham Dave ...
He'd love to touch, he's afraid that he might self-combust 
I could say more, but you get the general idea

DO YOUR BEST AND DON'T WORRY

Compare the best of their days 
With the worst of your days 
You won't win 
With your standards so high 
And your spirits so low 
At least remember ... 
This is you on a bad day, you on a pale day 
Just do your best and don't ... Don't worry, oh 
The way you hang yourself is oh, so unfair 
See the best of how they look 
Against the worst of how you are
And again, you won't win 
With your standards so high 
And your spirits so low 
At least remember ... 
This is you on a drab day, you in a drab dress 
Just do your best and don't ... Don't worry, oh 
The way you hang yourself is oh, so unfair 
Just do your best and don't ... Don't worry, oh 
The way you watch yourself is oh, so unfair 
Just do your best and don't ... Don't worry, oh 
Do your best and don't ...

 

BEST FRIEND ON THE PAYROLL

I turn the music down; and I don't know why, this is my house 
I turn the music down; and I don't know why, this is my house 
The best friend on the payroll 
No, no, no, it's not gonna work out 
It's not gonna work out, No, no, no, no 
The best friend on the payroll 
Oh, no, no, no, it's not gonna work out 
It's not gonna work out 
More breakfast in bed, and I'll bring the paper in later
The best friend on the payroll 
Oh, no, no, no, it's not gonna work out 
It's not gonna work out, No, no, no, no 
The best friend on the payroll 
Oh, no, no, no, it's not gonna work out 
It's not gonna work out 
More breakfast in bed, and I'll bring the paper in later
The best friend on the payroll 
No, no, no, it's not gonna work out 
It's not gonna work out, No, no, no, no 
The best friend on the payroll 
No, no, no, no, it's not gonna work out 
It's not gonna work out

 

SOUTHPAW

You were a boy before you became a man 
I don't see the joy 
And you ran with your pals in the sun 
You turned around and they were gone 
Again ... 
A sick boy should be treated 
So easily defeated 
Oh, I just don't understand 
So you ran with your pals in the sun 
You turned around 
You were alone 
Again ... 
And you ran back to Ma 
Which set the pace for the rest of your days 
Oh, you ran back to Ma 
Which set the pace for the rest of your days 
Oh, you ran back to Ma 
Which set the pace for the rest of your days 
And now, there is something that you should know 
There is something that you should know 
The girl of your dreams is 
Here all alone 
Girl of your dreams is 
Here all alone 
The girl of your dreams is 
Sad and all alone 
The girl of your dreams is 
Here all alone 
There is something that you should know 
There is something that you should know 
Girl of your dreams is 
Here all alone 
The girl of your dreams is 
Sad and is all alone 
The girl of your dreams is 
Sad and is feeling all alone 
Oh, there is something that you should know 
Help me, help me, help me ...

 

MALADJUSTED

I wanna start from 
Before the beginning 
Loot wine, "Be mine, and 
Then let's stay out for the night"
Ride via Parkside 
Semi-perilous lives 
Jeer the lights in the windows 
Of all safe and stable homes 
(But wondering then, well what 
Could peace of mind be like ?)
Anyway do you want to hear 
Our story, or not ? 
As the Fulham Road lights 
Stretch and invite into the night 
From a Stevenage overspill 
We'd kill to live around 
SW6 - with someone like you 
Keep thieves' hours 
With someone like you 
...As long as it slides 
You stalk the house 
In a low-cut blouse : 
"Oh Christ, another stifled 
Friday night !"
And the Fulham Road lights 
Stretch and invite into the night 
Well, I was fifteen 
What could I know ?
When the gulf between 
All the things I need 
And the things I receive 
Is an ancient ocean 
Wide, wild, lost, uncrossed 
Still I maintain there's nothing 
Wrong with you 
You do all that you do 
Because it's all you can do 
Well, I was fifteen 
Where could I go ?
With a soul full of loathing 
For stinging bureaucracy 
Making it anything 
Other than easy 
For working girls like me 
With my hands on my head 
I flop on your bed 
With a head full of dread 
For all I've ever said 
Maladjusted, maladjusted 
Maladjusted maladjusted 
Never to be trusted 
Oh, never to be trusted 
There's nothing wrong with you, oh 
...There's nothing wrong with you

 

ALMA MATTERS

So : the choice I have made 
May seem strange to you 
But who asked you, anyway ? 
It's my life to wreck 
My own way 
You see : to someone, somewhere, oh yeah ... 
Alma matters 
In mind, body and soul 
In part, and in whole 
Because to someone, somewhere, oh yeah ... 
Alma matters 
In mind, body and soul 
In part, and in whole 
So the life I have made 
May seem wrong to you 
But, I've never been surer 
It's my life to ruin 
My own way 
You see : to someone, somewhere, oh yeah ... 
Alma matters 
In mind, body and soul 
In part, and in whole 
Because to someone, somewhere, oh yeah ... 
Alma matters 
In mind, body and soul 
In part, and in whole 
To someone, somewhere, oh yeah ... 
Alma matters 
In mind, body and soul 
Part, and in whole 
So to someone, somewhere, oh yeah ... 
Alma matters 
In mind, body and soul 
Part, and in whole 
To someone, somewhere, oh yeah ... 
Oh yeah ... Oh yeah, oh yeah Oh yeah ...

 

AMBITIOUS OUTSIDERS

Bolt-lock your doors 
Alarm your cars 
And still we move in closer 
Every day 
Top of the list 
Is your smiling kids 
But we'll be smiling too 
So that's OK 
Oh, and by the way 
Thank you, because you're 
Giving, giving, giving 
And we're receiving - 
No, no, we're taking 
Keeping the population down 
Your taxes paid, but 
Police waylaid 
And we knows 
When the school bus 
Comes and goes 
We're on your street, but 
You don't see us 
Or, if you do 
You smile and say Hello 
BUT DON'T UNDERESTIMATE US 
When you are 
Giving, giving, giving 
And we're receiving - 
No, no, we're taking 
Just keeping 
The population down 
You're giving, giving, giving 
Well, it's your own fault 
For reproducing 
We're just keeping 
The population down

 

TROUBLE LOVES ME

Trouble loves me 
Trouble needs me 
Two things 
More than you do 
Or would attempt to 
So, console me 
Otherwise, hold me 
Just when it seems like 
Everything's evened out 
And the balance 
Seems serene 
Trouble loves me 
Walks beside me 
To chide me 
Not to guide me 
It's still much more 
Than you'll do 
So, console me 
Otherwise, hold me 
Just when it seems like 
Everything's evened out 
And the balance seems serene 
See the fool I'll be 
Still running 'round 
On the flesh rampage 
Still running 'round 
Ready with ready-wit 
Still running 'round 
On the flesh rampage 
- At your age ! 
Go to Soho, oh 
Go to waste in 
The wrong arms 
Still running 'round 
Trouble loves me 
Seeks and finds me 
To charlatanize me 
Which is only 
As it should be 
Oh, please fulfill me 
Otherwise, kill me 
Show me a barrel and watch me scrape it 
Faced with the music, as always I'll face it 
In the half-light 
So English, frowning 
Then at midnight I 
Can't get you out of my head 
A disenchanted taste 
Still running 'round 
A disenchanted taste 
Still running 'round

 

PAPA JACK

Papa Jack 
Wants to turn 
Back the clock 
And reach out 
To the kids 
He once had 
Who have flown 
Papa Jack 
In decline 
Feels inclined 
To reach out 
To the kids 
He once had 
Who have flown 
But there was a time 
When the kids reached up 
And Papa Jack just 
Pushed them away 
Looking deep 
In his heart 
Papa Jack 
Doesn't like 
What he sees 
Or the time 
On his hands 
The dying day 
The chilly sun 
Papa Jack 
All alone 
Sings slow 
Grieving and low 
But there was a time 
When the kids reached up 
Now you can't always 
Have it your way 
Papa Jack 
Ah ...

 

AMMUNITION

I know these roads 
Each ridge 
And narrow bridge 
Each cheveron 
Enticing me on 
Each warning sign 
I take in my stride 
I don't need more ammunition 
I've got more than I can spend 
I don't dwell on things I'm missing 
I'm just pleased 
With the things I've found 
I know these roads 
An old hand understands 
Above all, I know what's 
Expected of me now 
Veering cliffwards 
I don't need more ammunition 
I've got more than I can spend 
I don't dwell on things I'm missing 
I'm just pleased 
With the things I've found 
With the things I've found 
With the things I've found 
I've found 
I've been crying 
It comes back on these salient days 
And it stays 
And it says : 
"We've never really been away" 
I don't need more ammunition 
I've got more than I can spend 
I don't think of who I'm missing 
I've got no space and no time 
In my life, anymore 
No space or time 
In my life, anymore 
For Revenge

 

WIDE TO RECEIVE

Download something 
Useful, or useless 
Because I'm lying here 
Wide to receive 
Almost anything 
You'd care to give 
And I don't 
Get along with myself 
And I'm not too keen 
On anyone else 
Turn on, plug in 
Then just walk away 
Unlock, process 
And then just go 
And I've never felt quite so alone 
As I do right now 
I'm lying here 
Wide to receive 
Almost anything 
You'd care to leave 
Wide, wide, wide Wide, wide, wide...

 

ROY'S KEEN

(GO ON !)
He's romancing you 
And chancing his arm 
He'll be here 
Smiling on time 
He's romancing you 
And chancing his arm 
He'll be here 
Smiling on time 
Roy's keen oh Roy's keen 
Roy's keen oh Roy's keen 
We've never seen a 
Keener window-cleaner 
Back up the ladder 
Into each corner 
Dunking the chamois 
Just think of the goodwill 
The ladder's a planet 
Roy is a star, and 
I am a satellite 
(But that's alright) 
He can hold a smile for as long 
As you require (even longer) 
He can hold a smile for as long 
As you require (even longer) 
Roy's keen oh Roy's keen 
Roy's keen oh Roy's keen 
We've never seen a 
Keener window-cleaner 
Back up the ladder 
Into each corner 
Dunking the chamois 
Just think of the goodwill 
The ladder's a planet 
Roy is a star, and 
I am a satellite 
I will be set alight 
Don't say you'll hold it steady 
Then you let it go 
Don't say you'll hold it steady 
Then you let it go Oh ...
You're up the ladder 
Into each corner 
Foot in a bucket 
We trust you to wreck it 
Even when it's under your nose 
Well, you just can't 
See it, can you ? 
Well, it's here 
Right under your nose 
And you just can't 
See it, can you? La la la la ...
Roy's keen, Roy's keen La la la la ...
We've never seen a 
Keener window-cleaner 
Oh ... La la la la ...

 

HE CRIED

I need you 
Simple words 
But words which had never been heard 
By the soul 
Stoned to death 
But still living 
And so he froze where he stood 
And he looked to the ground 
And he cried 
He cried 
Ride our minds 
If you must 
But there's always a line you don't cross 
Time is short 
Don't be cruel 
Oh you don't know the power 
In what you're saying 
Oh ... 
And so he froze where he stood 
And he looked to the ground 
And he cried 
He cried 
People where 
I come from 
They survive without feelings or blood 
I never could 
Was stoned to death 
But I'm still living 
So he froze where he stood 
And he looked to the ground 
And he cried 
He cried 
So he froze 
And he looked, and he looked 
To the ground 
And he cried 
He cried

 

SORROW WILL COME IN THE END

Legalized theft 
Leaves me bereft 
I get it straight in the neck 
(Somehow expecting no less) 
A court of justice 
With no use for Truth 
Lawyer ...liar 
Lawyer ...liar 
You pleaded and squealed 
And you think you've won 
But Sorrow will come 
To you in the end 
And as sure as my words are pure 
I praise the day that brings you pain 
Q.C.'s obsessed with sleaze 
Frantic for Fame 
They're all on the game 
They just use a different name 
You lied 
And you were believed 
By a J.P. senile and vile 
You pleaded and squealed 
And you think you've won 
But Sorrow will come 
To you in the end 
And as sure as my words are pure 
I praise the day that brings you pain 
So don't close your eyes 
Don't close your eyes 
A man who slits throats 
Has time on his hands 
And I'm gonna get you 
So don't close your eyes 
Don't ever close your eyes 
You think you've won 
OH NO

 

SATAN REJECTED MY SOUL

Satan rejected my soul 
He knows my kind 
He won't be dragged down 
He's seen my face around 
He knows Heaven doesn't seem 
To be my home 
So I must find 
Somewhere else to go 
So I must find 
Somewhere else to go 
So, take it - please 
It's free 
You'll never see 
You'll never see 
All the fun in life it's cost me 
Satan rejected my soul 
As low as he goes 
He never quite goes this low 
He's seen my face around 
He knows Heaven doesn't seem 
To be my home 
So I must find 
Somewhere else to go 
So I must find 
Somewhere else to go 
So, take it please 
It's really sly 
Come on, come on, ah Come on, come on, come on 
Take it please, It's really sly 
Come on, come on, ah Come on, come on, come on 
Call me in, Pull me in, call me in 
Come on, come on, oh Come on, come on, come on 
Pull me in, pull me in, Call me in, haul me in, pull me in 
Come on, come on, ah, Come on, come on 
La la la la la, Oh ...

 
 REEL AROUND THE FOUNTAIN

It's time the tale was told
of how you took a child
and you made him old
Reel around the fountain
slap me on the patio
I'll take it now
Fifteen minutes with you
well, I wouldn't say no
people said that you were virtually dead
and they were so wrong
fifteen minutes with you
well, i wouldn't say no
people said that you were easily led
and they were half-right
I dreamt about you last night
and i fell out of bed twice
you can pin and mount me like a butterfly
but take me to the haven of your bed
was something that you never said
two lumps, please
you're the bee's knees
but so am I
Meet me at the fountain
shove me on the patio
I'll take it slowly
Fifteen minutes with you
oh I wouldn't say no
people see no worth in you
oh but I do

 

YOU'VE GOT EVERYTHING NOW

As merry as the days were long
I was right and you were wrong
back at the old grey school
I would win and you would lose
But you've got everything now
and what a terrible mess I've made of my life
No, I've never had a job
because I've never wanted one
I've seen you smile
but I've never really heard you laugh
So who is rich and who is poor?
I cannot say...
You are your mother's only son
and you're a desperate one
But I don't want a lover
I just want to be seen in the back of your car
A friendship sadly lost?
Well, this is true ...and yet, it's false
Did I ever tell you , by the way
I never did like your face
But you've got everything now
and what a terrible mess I've made of my life
No, I've never had a job
because I'm too shy
But I don't want a lover
I just want to be tied to the back of your car.

 

MISERABLE LIE

So, goodbye
please stay with your own kind
and I'll stay with mine
There's something against us
it's not time
So, goodbye
I know I hardly say
how much I love your casual way
but please put your tongue away
a little higher and we're well away
the dark nights are drawing in
and your humour is as black as them
I look at yours, you laugh at mine
and"love" is just a miserable lie
you have destroyed my flower like-life
not once-but twice
you have corrupt my innocent mind
not once-but twice
I know that wind-swept mystical air
it means: I'd like to see your underwear
I recognise that mystical air
it means: I'd like to see your underwear
what do we get for the trouble and pain?
just a rented room in Whalley Range
into the depths of the criminal world
I followed her...
I need advice, I need advice
because nobody ever looks at me twice
I'm just a country-mile behind
the world
I'm just a country mile behind
the whole world
so take me when you go

 

PRETTY GIRLS MAKE GRAVES

Upon the sand,upon the bay
"there is a quick and easy way" you say
before you illustrate
I'd rather state:
"I'm not the man you think I am
I'm not the man you think I am "
And Sorrow's native son
he will not smile for anyone
And pretty girls makes the graves
End of the pier, end of the bay
you tug my arm and say:"Give into lust,
give up to lust, oh heaven knows we'll
soon be dust..."
But I'm not the man you think I am
I'm not the man you think I am
And Sorrow's native son
he will not rise for anyone
And pretty girls make graves
I could have been wild and I could have been free
but Nature played this trick on me
She wants it Now
and she will not wait
but she's too rough
and I'm too delicate
Then on the sand
another man, he takes her hand
and a smile lights up her stupid face
(and well, it would)
I lost my faith in Womanhood
I lost my faith in Womanhood, I lost my faith

 

THE HAND THAT ROCKS THE CRADLE

Please don't cry
the ghost and the storm outside
will not invade this sacred shire
nor infiltrate your mind
my life down I shall lie
if the bogey-man should try
to play tricks on your sacred mind
to tease, torment and tantalise
wavering shadows loom
a piano plays in an empty room
there'll be blood on the cleaver tonight
when darkness lifts and the room is bright
I'll still be by your side
for you are all that matters
and I'll love you till the day I die
there never need to be longing in your eyes
as long as the hand that rocks the cradle is mine
ceiling shadows shimmy by
and when the wardrobe towers like a beast of prey
there's a sadness in your beautiful eyes
you're untouched, unsoiled, wonderous eyes
my life down I shall lie
should restless spirts try
to play tricks on you sacred mind
but whom I never gave a name
I just looked into his wonderous eyes
and said" never never never again"
all too soon I did return
just like a moth to a flame
so rattle my bones all over the stones
because I'm only a beggar-man whom nobody owns
see how words as old as sin
fit me like a glove I'm here and here I'll stay
together we lie, together we pray
there never need be longing in your eyes
as long as the hand that rocks the cradle is mine

 

STILL ILL

I decree today that life
is simply taking and not giving
England is mine and it owes me a living
ask me why, and I'll spit in your eye
ask me why, and I'll spit in your eye
but we cannot cling to the old dreams anymore
no, we cannot cling to the old dreams anymore
Does the body rule the mind
or does the mind rule the body?
I dunno...
Under the iron bridge we kissed
and although I ended up with sore lips
it just wasn't like the old days anymore
no, it wasn't like those days
am I still ill?
Does the body rule the mind
or does the mind rule the body ?
I dunno...
Ask me why, and I'll die
ask me why, and I'll die
and if you must go to work tomorrow
well, if I were you I wouldn't bother
for there are brighter sides to life
and I should know because I've seen them
but not very often...
under the iron bridge we kissed
and although I ended up with sore lips
it just wasn't like the old days anymore
no, it wasn't like those days
am I still ill?

 

HAND IN GLOVE

Hand in glove
the sun shines out of our behinds
no, it's not like any other love
this one is different-because it's us
Hand in glove
we can go wherever we please
and everything depends upon
how near you stand to me
And if the people stare
then the people stare
I really don't know and I really don't care
Hand in glove
the Good People laugh
yes, we may be hidden by rags
but we have something they'll never have
So, hand in glove I stake my claim
I'll fight to the last breath
If they dare touch a hair on your head
I'll fight to the last breath
The Good Life is out there, somewhere
so stay on my arm, you little charmer
But I know my luck too well
and I'll probably never see you again.

 

WHAT DIFFERENCE DOES IT MAKE?

All men have secrets and here is mine
so let it be known
we have been through hell and high tide,
I can surely rely on you?
and yet you start to recoil,
heavy words are so lightly thrown
but still I'd leap in front of a flying bullet for you
So, what difference does it make?
so, what difference does it make?
it makes none
but you have gone
and you must be looking very old tonight
The devil will find work for idle hands to do
I stole and I lied, and why?
because you asked me to!
but now you make feel so ashamed
because I've only got two hands
well, I'm still fond of you
So, what difference does it make?
so, what difference does it make?
it makes none
but you have gone
and your prejudice won't keep you warm tonight
So, no more apologies
no more apologies
I'm too tired
I'm too sick and tired
and I'm feeling very sick and ill today
But I'm still fond of you

 

I DON'T OWE YOU ANYTHING

Bought on stolen wine
a nod was the first step
you know very well
what was coming next
did I really walk all this way
just to hear you say
"oh I don't want to go out tonight"
but you will
for you must
I don't owe you anything
but you owe me something
repay me now
you should never go to them
let them come to you
just like I do
you should not go to them
let them come to you
just like I do
Too freely on your lips
words prematurely said
oh but I know what will make you smile tonight
Life is never kind
life is never kind
oh but I know what will make you smile tonight

 

SUFFER LITTLE CHILDREN

Over the moors,take me to the moors
dig a shallow grave
and I'll lay me down
Lesley-Anne, with your pretty white beads
oh John, you'll never be a man
and you'll never see your home again
oh Manchester, so much to answer for
Edward, see those alluring lights?
tonight will be your very last night
a woman said "I know my son is dead
I'll never rest my hands on his scared head"
Hindley wakes and Hindley says:
"Wherever he has gone, I have gone "
But fresh lilaced moorland fields
cannot hide the stoild stench of death
Hindley wakes and Hindley says:
"Whatever he has done, I have done"
But this is no easy ride
for a child cries
"find me...find me, nothing more
we're on a sullen misty moor
we may be dead and we may be gone
but we will be right by your side
until the day you die
this is no easy ride
we will haunt you when you laugh
yes, you could say we're a team
you might sleep
BUT YOU WILL NEVER DREAM!"
Oh Manchester, so much to answer for
Oh Manchester, so much to answer for
Over the moor, I'm on the moor
the child is on the moor

RUSHOLME RUFFIANS

The last night at the fair
by the big wheel generator
a boy is stabbed
and his money is grabbed
and the air hangs heavy like a dulling wine
she is famous
she is funny
an engagement ring
doesn't mean a thing
to a mind consumed by brass(money)
and though I walk home alone
my faith in love is still devout
the last night at the fair
from a seat on a whirling waltzer
her skirt ascends for a watching eye
it's a hideous trait( on her mother's side)
and though I walk home alone
my faith in love is still devout
then someone falls in love
and someone's beaten up
and the senses being dulled are mine
and someone falls in love
someone's beaten up
and the senses being dulled are mine
and though I walk home alone
my faith in love is still devout
this is the last night of the fair
and the grease in the hair
of a speedway operator
is all a tremulous heart requires
a schoolgirl is denied
she said "How quickly would I die
if I jumped from the top of the parachutes?"
this is the last night of the fair
and the grease in the hair
of a speedway operator
is all a tremulous heart requires
a schoolgirl is denied
she said "How quickly would I die
if I jumped from the top of the parachutes?"
scratch my name on your arm with a fountain pen
(this means you really love me)
scratch my name on your arm with a fountain pen
(this means you really love me)
and though I walk home alone
my faith in love is still devout

 

I WANT THE ONE I CAN'T HAVE

On the day that your mentality
catches up with your biology
I want the one I can't have
and it's driving me mad
it's written all over my face
A double-bed
and a stalwart lover, for sure
these are the riches of the poor
A double-bed
and a stalwart lover, for sure
these are the riches of the poor
a tough kid who sometimes swallows nails
raised on Prisoner's Aid
he killed a policeman when he was thirteen
and somehow that really impressed me
it's written all over my face
On the day that your mentality
catches up with your biology
And if you ever need self-validation
just meet me in the alley by the
railway-station
it's written all over my face

 

WHAT SHE SAID

What she said:
"How come someone hasn't noticed
that I'm dead
and decided to bury me
God knows, I'm ready"
What she said was
but then, all the rejection she's had
to pretend to be happy
could only be idiocy
What she said was not for the job or
lover that she never had
What she read
all heady books
she'd sit and prophesise
(it took a tattoed boy from Birkenhead
to really really open her eyes)

THAT JOKE ISN'T FUNNY ANYMORE

Park the car at the side of the road
you should know
time's tide will smother you
and I will too
when you laugh about other people who feel so
very lonely
their only desire is to die
well I'm afraid
it doesn't make me smile
I wish I could laugh
but that joke isn't funny anymore
it's too close to home and it's too near the bone
it's too close to home and it's too near the bone
more than you'll ever know
It was dark as I drove the point home
and on cold leather seats
well, it suddenly struck me
I just might die with a smile on my
face after all
I've seen this happen in other people's lives
and now it's happening in mine

 

NOWHERE FAST

I'd like to drop my trousers to the world
I am a man of means(of slender means)
each household appliance
is like a new science in my town
and if a day came when I felt a natural emotion
I'd get such a shock I'd probably jump in the ocean
and when a train goes by
it's such a sad sound
I'd like to drop my trousers to the Queen
every sensible child will know what this means
the poor and the needy
are selfish and greedy on her terms
and if the day came when I felt a natural emotion
I'd get such a shock I'd probably jump in the ocean
and when a train goes by
it's such a sad song
And when I'm lying in my bed
I think about life
and I think about death
and neither one particularly appeals to me
and if the day came when I felt a natural emotion
I'd get such a shock I'd probably lie
in the middle of the street and die
I'd lie down and die

 

WELL I WONDER

Well I wonder
do you hear me when you sleep?
I hoarsely cry
Well I wonder
do you see me when we pass?
I half-die
Please keep me in mind
please keep me in mind
Gasping-but somehow still alive
this is the fierce last stand of all I am
Gasping-dying-but somehow still alive
this is the final stand of all I am
Please keep me in mind

 

BARBARISM BEGINS AT HOME

Unruly boys
who will not grow up
must be taken in hand
Unruly girls
who will not settle down
they must be taken in hand
A crack on the head
is what you get for not asking
and a crack on the head
is what you get for asking

 

MEAT IS MURDER

Heifer whines could be human cries
closer comes the screaming knife
this beautiful creature must die
this beautiful creature must die
a death for no reason
and death for reason is MURDER
and the flesh you so fancifully fry
is not succulent, tasty or nice
it's death for no reason
and death for no reason is MURDER
and the calf that you carve with a smile
is MURDER
and the turkey you festively slice
is MURDER
do you know how animals die?
kitchen aroma aren't very homely
it's not "comforting," "cheery" or kind
it's sizzling blood and the unholy stench
of MURDER
it's not "natural," "normal" or kind
the fleas you so fancifully fry
as you savour the flavour
of MURDER
NO, NO, NO, IT'S MURDER
NO, NO, NO, IT'S MURDER
who hears when animals cry?

 

THE QUEEN IS DEAD

Farewell to this lands cheerless marches
hemmed in like a boar between arches
her very Lowness with her head in a sling
Im truely sorry-but it sounds like a wonderful thing
dear Charles, dont you ever crave
to appear on the front of the Daily mail
dressed in your Mother's bridal veil?
So, I checked all the registered historical facts
and I was shocked into shame to discover
how Im the 18th pale descendent
of some, old queen or other
has the world changed, or have I changed?
has the world changed, or have I changed?
as some 9-year old tough peddles drugs
(I never even knew what drugs were)
And so, I broke into the Palace
with a sponge and a rusty spanner
she said: "Eh, I know you, and you cannot sing"
I said: "that's nothing -you should hear me play piano"
We can go for a walk where it's quiet and dry
and we can talk about precious things
but when you are tied to your mother's apron
not one talks about castration
We can go for a walk where it's quiet and dry
and we can talk about precious things
like love and law and poverty
these are the things that kill me
We can go for a walk where it's quiet and dry
and we can talk about precious things
but the rain that flattens my hair
theses are the things that kill me
Passed the Pub that saps your body
and the church who'll snatch your money
the Queen is dead, boys
and it's so lonely on a limb
Pass the Pub that wrecks your body
and the church-all they want is your money
the Queen is dead, boys`
you can trust me, boys
life is very long, when you're lonely
life is very long, when you're lonely...

 

FRANKLY MR.SHANKLY

Frankly, Mr Shankly, this position Ive held
it pays my way, but it corrodes my soul
I want to leave you will not miss me
I want to go down in musical history
Frankly, Mr Shankly, Im a sickening wreck
Ive got the 21st Century breathing down my neck
I must move fast, you understand me
I want to go down in celluloid history
Fame, Fame, fatal Fame
it can play hideous tricks on the brain
but still I rather be Famous
than righteous or holy, any day
but sometimes Id feel more fulfilled
making Christmas cards with the mentally ill
I want to Live and I want to Love
I want to catch something that I might be ashamed of
Frankly, Mr Shankly, this position I've held
it pays my way and it corrodes my soul
oh, I didnt realise that you wrote poetry
(I didnt realise you wrote such bloody awful poetry)
Frankly, Mr Shankly, since you ask
you are a flatulent pain the arse
I do not mean to be so rude
but still, I must speck frankly, Mr Shankly

 

I KNOW IT'S ALL OVER

Oh Mother, I can fell the soil falling over my head
and as i climb into an empty bed
Oh well, Enough said
I know it's over-still I cling
I don't know where else I can go
Oh Mother, I can feel the soil falling over my head
see, the sea want s to take me
the knife wants to cut me
do you think you can help me?
Sad veiled bride, please be happy
handsome groom, give her room
loud, loutish lover, treat her kindly
(although she needs you
more than she loves you)
and I know it's over
and it never really began
but in my heart it was so real
and you even spoke to me and said:
"If you're so funny
then why are you on your own tonight?
and if you are so clever
then why are you on your own tonight?
if you're so terribly good looking
then why do you sleep alone tonight?
because tonight is just like any other night
that's why you're on your own tonight
with your triumphs and your charms
while they are in each other's arms.."
It's so easy to laugh
it's so easy to hate
it takes strength to be gentle and kind
It's so easy to laugh
it's so easy to hate
it takes guts to be gentle and kind
love is Natural and Real
but not for you, my love
not tonight my love
love is Natural and Real
but not for such as you and I, my love
Oh Mother, I can fell the soil falling over my head
Oh Mother, I can fell the soil falling over my head...

 

NEVER HAD NO ONE EVER

When you walk without ease
on these
the very streets where you were raised
I had a really bad dream
it lasted 20 years, 7 months, and 27 days
Never had no one ever.

 

CEMETERY GATES

A dreaded sunny day
so I meet you at the cemetry gates
Keats and Yeats are on your side
A dreaded sunny day
so I meet you at the cemetry gates
Keats and Yeats are on your side
while Wilde is on mine
So we go inside and we gravely read the stones
all those people all those lives
where are they now ?
with loves, and hates
and passions just like mine
they were born
and then they lived and then they died
which seems so unfair
and I wantr to crv
You say: "ere thrice the sun hath done salutation to the dawn"
and you claim these words as your own
but Im well-read, have heard them said
a hundred times (maybe less, maybe more)
if you must write prose/poems
the words you use should be your own
dont plagiarise or take "on loans"
there's alweays someone, somewhere
with a big nose, who knows
and who trips you up and laughs
when you fall
You say: "ere long done do does did "
words which could only be your own
you then produce the text
from whence was ripped
(some dizzy whore, 1804)
A dreaded sunny day
so let's go where we're happy
so I meet you at the cemetry gates
Keats and Yeats are on your side
A dreaded sunny day
so let's go where we're wanted
so I meet you at the cemetry gates
Keats and Yeats are on your side
but you lose
because Wilde is on mine

 

BIGMOUTH STRIKES AGAIN

Sweetness, sweetness I was only joking
when I said Id like to smash every tooth
in your head
Sweetness, sweetness I was only joking
when I said by right s you should be
bludgeoned in your bed
and now I know how Joan of Arc felt
now I know how Joan of Arc felt
as the flames roseto her roman nose
and her Walkman stared to melt
Bibmouth, bigmouth
bigmouth strikes again
and Ive got no right to take my place
with the Human race
and now I know how Joan of Arc felt
now I know of Joan of Arc felt
as the flames rose to her roman nose
and her hearing aid started to melt
Bigmouth, bigmouth
bigmouth strikes again

THE BOY WITH A THORN IN HIS SIDE

The boy with the thorn in his side
behind the hatred there lies
a murderous desire for love
how can they look into my eyes
and still they dont believe me
how can they hear me say those words
and still they dont believe me
and if they don't believe me now
will they ever believe me?
and if they don't believe me now
will they ever believe me?
The boy with the thorn in his side
behind the hatred there lies
a plundering desire for love
how can they see the Love in our eyes
and still they don't believe us
and after all this time
they don't want to believe us
and if they dont believe us now
will they ever believe us ?
andd when you want to Live
how do you start ?
where do you go ?
who do you know?

 

VICAR IN A TUTU

I was minding mind business
lifting some lead off
the roof of the Holy Name church
it was worthwhile living a laughable life
just to set my eyes on a blistering sight
of a vicar in a tu-tu
he's not strange
he just wants to live his life this way
a scanty bit of a thing
with a decorative ring
that wouldn't cover the head of a child
as Rose collects the money in the cannister
who comes sliding down the bannister
the vicar in a tu-tu
he's not strange
he just wants to live his life this way
the monkish monsignor
with a head full of plaster
said "my man, get your vile soul dry-cleaned"
as Rose counts the money in the cannister
as natural as rain
he dances again
vicar in a tu-tu
The next day in the pulpit
with Freedom and Ease
combating ignoranca,dust and disease
as Rose counts the money in the cannister
as natural as rain
he dances again
the fabric of a tu-tu
any man could get us to
and I am a living sign.

 

THERE IS A LIGHT THAT NEVER GOES OUT

Take me out tonight
where there's music and there's people
who are young and alive
driving in your car
I never never want to go home
because I havent got one
anymore
take me out tonight
because I want to see people and I
want to see lights
driving in your car
oh please dont drop me home
because it's not my home, it's their
home, and Im welcome no morw
and if a double-decker bus
crashes in to us
to die by your side
such a heavenly way to die
and if a ten ton truck
kills the both of us
to die by your side
the pleasure and the privilege is mine
take me out tonight
oh take me anywhere, I dont care
and in the darken underpass
I thought Oh God, my chance has come at last
(but then a strange fear gripped me and I just couldn't ask)
take me out tonight
take me anywhere, I dont care
just driving in your car
I never never want to go home
because I havent got one
I havent got one.

 

SOME GIRLS ARE BIGGER THAN OTHERS

From the ice-age to the dole-age
there is but one concern
and I have just discover
some girls are bigger than others
some girls are bigger than others
some girls mothers are bigger than
other girls mothers
As Anthony said to Cleopatra
as he opened a crate of ale:
some girls are bigger than others
some girls are bigger than others
some girls mothers are bigger than
other girls mothers.

 

A RUSH AND A PUSH AND AND THE LAND IS OURS

HELLO
I am the ghost of Troubled Joe
hung by his pretty white neck
some eighteen months ago
I travelled to a mystical time zone
but I missed my bed
so I soon came home
they said:
"there's too much caffeine
in your bloodstream
and a lack of real spice
in your life"
I said:
"leave me alone
because I'm alright, dad
just surprised to still
be on my own...."
Ooh, but don't mention love
I'd hate the real strain of the pain again
a rush and a push and the land that
we stand on is ours
it has been before
so it shall be again
and people who are uglier than you and I
they take what they need, and leave
Ooh, but don't mention love
I'd hate the pain and the strain all over again
a rush and a push and the land that
we stand on is ours
it has been before
so why can't it be now?
and people who are weaker than you and I
they take what they want from life
Ooh, but don't mention love
no - just don't mention love!
a rush and a push and the land that
we stand on is ours
your youth may be gone
but you're still a young man
so phone me, phone me, phone me
so phone me, phone me, phone me
Ooh, I think I'm in love...
Urrgh, I think I'm in lerv

 

I STARTED SOMETHING I COULDN'T FINISH

The lanes were silent
with nothing or no one around for miles
I doused our friendly venture
with a hard-faced
three-word gesture
I started something
I forced you into a zone
and you were clearly
never meant to go
hair brushed and parted
typical me, typical me, typical me
I started something
...and now I'm not too sure
I grabbed you by the guilded beams
that's what Tradition means
and I doused another venture
with a gesture
that was...absolutely vile
I started something
forced you to a zone
and you were clearly
never meant to go
hair brushed and parted
typical me, typical me, typical me
I started something
...and now I'm not too sure
I grabbed you by the guilded beams
that's what Tradition means
and now eighteen months' hard-labour
seems...fair enough
I started something
forced you to a zone
and you were clearly
never meant to go
hair brushed and parted
typical me, typical me, typical me
I started something

DEATH OF A DISCO DANCER

The death of a disco dancer
well, it happens a lot 'round here
and if you think Peace
is a common goal
well, that goes to show
just how little you know
The death of a disco dancer
well, I'd rather not get involved
I never talk to my neighbour
I'd just rather not get involved
Love, peace and harmony?
Love, peace and harmony?
Oh, very nice, very nice, very nice, very nice
...but maybe in the next world.

 

GIRLFRIEND IN A COMA

Girlfriend in a coma, I know
I know - it's serious
Girlfriend in a coma, I know
I know - it's really serious
there wree times when I could
have 'murdered' her
(but, you know, I would hate
anything to happen to her)
NO, I DON'T WANT TO SEE HER
Do you really think
she'll pull through?
Do you really think
she'll pull through?
Girlfriend in a coma, I know
I know, it's serious
there were time when I could
have 'strangeled' her

WOULD YOU PLEASE LET ME SEE HER!
Do you really think she'll pull through?
Do you really think she'll pull through?
Let me wisper my last goodbyes
I know - IT'S SERIOUS

 

STOP ME IF YOU'VE HEARD THIS ONE BEFORE

Stop me, stop me,
stop me if you think that you've heard this one before
stop me, stop me
stop me if you think that you've heard this one before
nothing's changed
I still love you, oh I still love you
...only slightly less than I used to
I was delayed, I was way-laid
an emergency stop
I smelt the last ten seconds of life
I crashed down on the crossbar
and the pain was enough to make
a shy, bald buddhist reflect
and plan a mass-murder
who said I'd lied to her?
who said I'd lied because I never
who said I'd lied because I never
I was detained, I was restrained
he broke my spleen
he broke my knees
(and then he really laid into me)
Friday night in Out-patients
who said I'd lied to her?
who said I'd lied - because I never
who said I'd lied - because I never
Oh, so I drank one
or was it four
and when I fell on the floor
...I drank more
stop me, stop me
stop me if you think that you've heard this one before
nothing's changed
I still love you, I still love you
but only slightly
less than I used to

 

LAST NIGHT I DREAMT THAT SOMEBODY LOVED ME

Last night I dreamt
that somebody loved me
no hope - but no harm
just another false alarm
Las night I felt
real arms around me
no hope - no harm
just another false alarm
so, tell me how long
before the last one?
and tell me how long
before the right one?
this story is old - I KNOW
but it goes on
this story is old - I KNOW
but it goes on

 

UNHAPPY BIRTHDAY

I've come to wish you an unhappy birthday
I've come to wish you an unhappy birthday
because you're evil
and you lie
and if you should die
I may feel slightly sad
(but I won't cry)
Loved and lost
and some may say
when usually its Nothing
surely you're happy
it should be this way?
I say "No, I'm gonna kill my dog"
and: "May the lines sag heavy
and deep tonight XXX"

PAINT A VULGAR PICTURE

At the record company meeting
On their hands - a dead star
and ooh, the plans that they weave
and ooh, the sikening greed
At the record company meeting
on their hands - a dead star
the sycophantic slags all say:
"I knew him first, and I knew him well"
Re-issue! Re-package! Re-package!
Re-evaluate the songs
double-pack with a photograph
Extra Track (and a tacky badge)
A-list, playlist
"Please them, please them!"
"Please them! Please them!"
(sadly, THIS was your life)
but you could have said no
if you'd wanted to
you could have said no
if you'd wanted to
BPI, MTV, BBC
"Please them! Please them!"
(sadly this was your life)
but you could have said no
if you'd wanted to
you could have walked away
...couldn't you?
I touched you at the soundcheck
you had no real way of knowing
in my heart I bgged "please, take
me with you...
I don't care where you're going"
But to you I was faceless
I was fawning, I was boring
just a child from those ugly new houses
who could never begin to know
who could never really know
Best of? Most of?
Satiate the need
slip them into different sleeves!
Buy both, and be decieved
climber - new entry, re-entry
World tour! ("media whore")
"Please the Press in Belgium!"
(THIS was your life...)
and when it fails to recoup?
Well, maybe:
You just haven't earned it yet, baby
I walked a pace behind you at the soundcheck
you're just the same as I am
what makes most people feel happy
leads us headlong into harm
so, in my bedroom in those 'ugly new houses'
I dance my legs down to the knees
but me and my 'true love'
we will never meet again...
At the record company meeting
on their hands - at last! - a dead star!
but they cannot taint you in my eyes
no, they cannout touch you now
No, they cannot hurt you my darling
they cannot touch you now
but me and my 'true love'
will never meet again

 

DEATH AT ONE'S ELBOW

Ooh Glenn, don't come to the house tonight
Ooh, Glenn, don't come to the house tonight
because there's somebody here
who really really loves you
stay home
be bored
(it's crap, I KNOW)
Ooh, Glenn, don't come to the house tonight
Ooh, Glen, don't come to the house tonight
because there's somebody here
who'll take a hatchet to your ear
how the frustration renders me
hateful, Glenn!
don't come to the house tonight
don't come to the house tonight
because you'll slip on the
trail of my bespattered remains
and so, that's why
GOODBYE MY LOVE, GOODBYE MY LOVE, GOODBYE MY LOVE...
Belch

 

I WON'T SHARE YOU

I won't share you
I won't share you
with the drive and ambition
and the zeal I feel
this is my time
as the note I wrote
was read, she said
has the Perrier gone
straight to my head
or is life plainly sick and cruel, instead?
"YES!"
No-no-no-no-no-no
I won't share you
I won't share you
with the drive and the dreams inside
this is my time
Life tends to come and go
well, that's OK
just as long as you know
Life tends to come and go
well, that's OK
just as long as you know
I won't share you
I won't share you

this is my time, this is my time

We can go for a walk where it's quiet and dry
and we can talk about precious things
but the rain that flattens my hair
theses are the things that kill me
Passed the Pub that saps your body
and the church who'll snatch your money
the Queen is dead, boys
and it's so lonely on a limb
Pass the Pub that wrecks your body
and the church-all they want is your money
the Queen is dead, boys`
you can trust me, boys
life is very long, when you're lonely
life is very long, when you're lonely...

 

PANIC

Panic on the streets of London
Panic on the streets of Birmingham
I wonder to myself
Could life ever be sane again
on the Leeds side-streets that you slip down
I wonder to myself
Hopes may rise on the Grasmeres
But Honey Pie, you're not safe here
So you run down
To the safety of the town
But there's Panic on the streets of Carlisle
Dublin, Dundee, Humberside
I wonder to myself
Burn down the Disco
Hang the blessed D.J.
Because the music that they constantly play
IT SAYS NOTHING TO ME ABOUT MY LIFE
Hang the blessed D.J.
Because the music they constantly play
On the Leeds side-streets that you slip down
On the provincial towns that you jog 'round
Hang the D.J.,. Hang the D.J.,.Hang the D.J...

 

VICAR IN A TUTU

I was minding mind business
lifting some lead off
the roof of the Holy Name church
it was worthwhile living a laughable life
just to set my eyes on a blistering sight
of a vicar in a tu-tu
he's not strange
he just wants to live his life this way
a scanty bit of a thing
with a decorative ring
that wouldn't cover the head of a child
as Rose collects the money in the cannister
who comes sliding down the bannister
the vicar in a tu-tu
he's not strange
he just wants to live his life this way
the monkish monsignor
with a head full of plaster
said "my man, get your vile soul dry-cleaned"
as Rose counts the money in the cannister
as natural as rain
he dances again
vicar in a tu-tu
The next day in the pulpit
with Freedom and Ease
combating ignoranca,dust and disease
as Rose counts the money in the cannister
as natural as rain
he dances again
the fabric of a tu-tu
any man could get us to
and I am a living sign.

 

ASK

Shyness is nice, but
Shyness can stop you
From doing all the things in life
That you'd like to
So, if there's something you'd like to try
ASK ME-I WON'T SAY "NO"-HOW COULD I?
Coyness is nice, but ,
Coyness can stop you
from saying all the things in
life that you want to
If there's something that you'd like to try
ASK ME-I WON'TSAY"NO"-HOW COULD I?
Spending warm, Summer days indoors
Writing fringhtening verse
To a buck-toothed girl in Luxembourg
ASK ME, ASK ME ,ASK ME, ASK ME, ASK ME ,ASK ME
Because if it's not Love
Then it's the Bomb
That will bring us together
Nature is a language-can't you read?
Nature is a language-can't you read?
ASK ME, ASK ME ,ASK ME, ASK ME, ASK ME ,ASK ME
Because if it's not Love
Then it's the Bomb
That will bring us together

 

MARIE'S THE NAME (HIS LATEST FLAME) / RUSHOLME RUFFIANS

Very old friend 
Came by today 
As he was telling everyone in town 
Of all the love that he'd just found 
And Marie's the name (of his latest flame) 
Talked and talked 
And I heard him say 
That she had the longest blackest hair 
Prettiest green eyes anywhere 
And Marie's the name (of his latest flame) 
The last night of the fair 
By the big wheel generator 
A boy is stabbed 
His money is grabbed 
And the air hangs heavy like a dulling wine 
She is Famous 
She is Funny 
An engagement ring 
Doesn't mean a thing 
To a mind consumed by brass (money), oh 
The last night of the fair 
From a seat on a whirling waltzer 
Her skirt ascends for a watching eye 
It's a hideous trait (on her mother's side)
From a seat on a whirling waltzer 
Her skirt ascends for a watching eye 
A hideous trait (on her mother's side) 
Then someone falls in love 
Someone's beaten up 
Someone's beaten up 
And the senses being dulled are mine 
And someone falls in love 
Someone's beaten up 
And the senses being dulled are mine 
This is the last night of the fair 
And the grease in the hair 
Of a speedway operator 
Is all a tremulous heart requires 
A schoolgirl is denied 
She said : "How quickly would I die 
If I jumped from the top of the parachutes ?"
This is the last night of the fair 
And the grease in the hair 
Of a speedway operator 
Is all a tremulous heart requires 
A schoolgirl is denied 
She said : "How quickly would I die 
Oh, if I jumped from the top of the parachutes ?"
...Oh, walk home alone 
I might walk home alone 
But my faith in love is still devout

 

THE BOY WITH THE THORN IN HIS SIDE

The boy with the thorn in his side
behind the hatred there lies
a murderous desire for love
how can they look into my eyes
and still they dont believe me
how can they hear me say those words
and still they dont believe me
and if they don't believe me now
will they ever believe me?
and if they don't believe me now
will they ever believe me?
The boy with the thorn in his side
behind the hatred there lies
a plundering desire for love
how can they see the Love in our eyes
and still they don't believe us
and after all this time
they don't want to believe us
and if they dont believe us now
will they ever believe us ?
andd when you want to Live
how do you start ?
where do you go ?
who do you know?

 

RUBBER RING / WHAT SHE SAID

Yeah! What she says : 
"How come someone hasn't noticed 
That I'm dead 
And decided to bury me ? 
God knows, I'm ready !"
La-la-la ... 
What she said was sad 
But then, all the rejection she's had 
To pretend to be happy 
Could only be idiocy 
La-la-la ... 
What she said was not for the job or 
Lover that she never had 
No no no ... 
What she read 
All heady books 
She'd sit and prophesise 
(It took a tattooed boy from 
Birkenhead 
To really really open her eyes)

IS IT REALLY SO STRANGE?

I left the North 
I travelled South 
I found a tiny house 
And I can't help the way I feel 
Oh yes, you can kick me 
And you can punch me 
And you can break my face 
But you won't change the way I feel 
'Cause I love you, Oh ... 
And is it really so strange ? 
Oh, is it really so strange ? 
Oh, is it really so, really so strange ? 
I say NO, you say YES 
(and you will change your mind) 
I left the South 
I travelled North 
I got confused - I killed a horse 
I can't help the way I feel 
Oh yes, you can punch me 
And you can butt me 
And you can break my spine 
But you won't change the way I feel 
'Cause I love you, Oh ... 
And is it really so strange ? 
Oh, is it really so strange ? 
Oh, is it really so, really so strange ? 
I say NO, you say YES 
(But you will change your mind) 
I left the North again 
I travelled South again 
And I got confused - I killed a nun 
I CAN'T HELP THE WAY I FEEL 
(I lost my bag in Newport Pagnell) 
Why is the last mile the hardest mile ? 
My throat was dry, with the sun in my eyes 
And I realised, I realised 
I could never 
I could never, never, never, go back home again

 

CEMETERY GATES

A dreaded sunny day
so I meet you at the cemetry gates
Keats and Yeats are on your side
A dreaded sunny day
so I meet you at the cemetry gates
Keats and Yeats are on your side
while Wilde is on mine
So we go inside and we gravely read the stones
all those people all those lives
where are they now ?
with loves, and hates
and passions just like mine
they were born
and then they lived and then they died
which seems so unfair
and I wantr to crv
You say: "ere thrice the sun hath done salutation to the dawn"
and you claim these words as your own
but Im well-read, have heard them said
a hundred times (maybe less, maybe more)
if you must write prose/poems
the words you use should be your own
dont plagiarise or take "on loans"
there's alweays someone, somewhere
with a big nose, who knows
and who trips you up and laughs
when you fall
You say: "ere long done do does did "
words which could only be your own
you then produce the text
from whence was ripped
(some dizzy whore, 1804)
A dreaded sunny day
so let's go where we're happy
so I meet you at the cemetry gates
Keats and Yeats are on your side
A dreaded sunny day
so let's go where we're wanted
so I meet you at the cemetry gates
Keats and Yeats are on your side
but you lose
because Wilde is on mine

 

LONDON

Smoke
Lingers 'round your fingers
Train
Heave on - to Euston
Do you think you've made
The right decision this time?
You left
Your tired family grieving
And you think they're sad because you're leaving
But didn't you see the Jealousy in the eyes
Of the ones who had to stay behind?
And do you think you've made
The right decision thins time?
You left
Your girlfriend on the platform
With thei really ragged notion that you'll return
But she knows
That when he goes
He really goes
So do you think you've made
The right decision this time?

 

I KNOW IT'S OVER

I can feel the soil falling over my head 
And as I climb into an empty bed 
Oh well. Enough said. 
I know it's over - still I cling 
I don't know where else I can go 
Over ... 
Oh Mother, I can feel the soil falling over my head 
See, the sea wants to take me 
The knife wants to cut me 
Do you think you can help me ? 
Sad veiled bride, please be happy 
Handsome groom, give her room 
Loud, loutish lover, treat her kindly 
(Though she needs you 
More than she loves you) 
And I know it's over - still I cling 
I don't know where else I can go 
Over, it's over, it's over, it's over 
It's over, la ... 
I know it's over 
And it never really began 
But in my heart it was so real
And you even spoke to me, and said : 
"If you're so funny 
Then why are you on your own tonight ? 
And if you're so clever 
Then why are you on your own tonight ? 
I know ... 
'Cause tonight - it's just like any other night 
That's why you're on your own tonight 
Your triumphs and your charms 
While they're in each other's arms..."
It's so easy to laugh 
It's so easy to hate 
It takes strength to be gentle and kind 
Over, over, over, over 
It's so easy to laugh 
It's so easy to hate 
It takes guts to be gentle and kind 
Over, over 
Love is Natural and Real 
But not for you, my love 
Not tonight, my love 
Love is Natural and Real 
But not for such as you and I, my love 
Oh Mother, I can feel the soil falling over my head...
Oh Mother, I can feel the soil fall over, fall over my head 
Oh Mother, I can feel the ... fall over my ... , Oh ...

 

THE DRAIZE TRAIN

A vastly superior version of the instrumental B-side, acting as a peace 
offering to Marr (Morrissey chose the tracks for the compilation, 
and of course, receives no royalties on this track).

 

STILL ILL

I decree today that life
is simply taking and not giving
England is mine and it owes me a living
ask me why, and I'll spit in your eye
ask me why, and I'll spit in your eye
but we cannot cling to the old dreams anymore
no, we cannot cling to the old dreams anymore
Does the body rule the mind
or does the mind rule the body?
I dunno...
Under the iron bridge we kissed
and although I ended up with sore lips
it just wasn't like the old days anymore
no, it wasn't like those days
am I still ill?
Does the body rule the mind
or does the mind rule the body ?
I dunno...
Ask me why, and I'll die
ask me why, and I'll die
and if you must go to work tomorrow
well, if I were you I wouldn't bother
for there are brighter sides to life
and I should know because I've seen them
but not very often...
under the iron bridge we kissed
and although I ended up with sore lips
it just wasn't like the old days anymore
no, it wasn't like those days
am I still ill?

 

BIGMOUTH STRIKES AGAIN

Sweetness, sweetness I was only joking
when I said Id like to smash every tooth
in your head
Sweetness, sweetness I was only joking
when I said by right s you should be
bludgeoned in your bed
and now I know how Joan of Arc felt
now I know how Joan of Arc felt
as the flames roseto her roman nose
and her Walkman stared to melt
Bibmouth, bigmouth
bigmouth strikes again
and Ive got no right to take my place
with the Human race
and now I know how Joan of Arc felt
now I know of Joan of Arc felt
as the flames rose to her roman nose
and her hearing aid started to melt
Bigmouth, bigmouth
bigmouth strikes again
and Ive got no right to take my place
with the Human race

 
ALSATIAN COUSTIN

Were you and he Lovers?
and would you say so if you were?
on a forecourt
on a Friday
passing my way
Were you and he Lovers?
and if you were, then say that you were!
on a groundsheet
under canvas
with your tent-flap
open wide
A note upon his desk:
"P.S. Bring Me Home And Have Me!"
Leather elbows on a tweed coat
- Oh! -
Is THAT the best you can do?
So came his reply:
"...but on the desk is where I want you!"
So I ask (even though I know):
were you and he Lovers?

 

LITTLE MAN, WHAT NOW?

An afternoon nostalgia
television show
you spoke in silhouette
(but they couldn't name you)
although the panel were
very polite to you
but I remembered you
from Friday nights 1969
ATV - you murdered every line
too old to be a child star
too young to take leads
four seasons passed
and they AXED you
nervously juvenile
(WON'T SMILE!)
What became of you?
did that swift eclipse torture you?
a star at eighteen
and then-suddenly gone
down to a few lines
in the back page of a teenage annual
oh but I remembered you
I looked up to you

 

EVERYDAY IS LIKE SUNDAY

Trudging slowly over wet sand
back to the bench
where your clothes were stolen
this is the coastal town
that they forgot to close down
Armageddon - come Armageddon!
Come Armageddon! Come!
Everyday is like Sunday
everyday is silent and grey
Hide on the promenade
scratch out a postcard
"how I dearly with I was not here"
in the seaside town
...that they forgot to bomb
Come! Come! Come - nuclear bomb!
Everyday is like Sunday
everyday is silent and grey
Trudging back over pebbles and sand
and a strange dust lands on your hands
(and on your face)
Everyday is like Sunday
"Win Yourself A Cheap Tray"
share some greased tea with me
everyday is silent and grey

 

BENGALI IN PLATFORMS

No no no
he does not want to depress you
oh no no no no no
he only wants to impress you
Bengali in platform
she only wants to embrace your culture
and to be your friend forever
Bengali, Bengali
oh shelve your Western plans
and understand that life is hard enough when you belong here
A silver-studded rim that glistens
and an ankle-star that...blinds me
a lemon sole so very high
which only reminds me, to tell you
so I break the news gently
I break the news to you gently
"Shelve your plans"
Bengali, Bengali
its the touchy march of time
that blinds you
don't blame me
don't hate me
just because I'm the one to tell you
that life is hard enough when you belong here
life is hard enough when you belong here
shelve your western plans
life is hard enough when you belong here

 

ANGEL, ANGEL, DOWN WE GO TOGETHER

Angel, Angel
don't take your life tonight
I know they take
and that they take in turn
and they give you nothing real
for yourself in return
and when they've used you
and they've broken you
and wasted all your money
and cast your shell aside
and when they've bought you
and they've sold you
and they've billed you for the pleasure
and they've made your parents cry
I will be here
BELIEVE ME
I will be here
...believe me
Angel, don't take your life
some people have got no pride
they do not understand
the Urgency of life
but I love you more than life
I love you more than life
I love you more than life
I love you more than life

 

LALE NIGHT, MAUDLIN STREET

The last night on Maudlin Street
goodbye house
goodbye stairs
I was born here
I was raised here, and
...I took some stick here
love at first sight
may sound trite
but it's true, you know
I could list the details
of everything you ever wore
or said, or how you stood that day
and as we spend the last night
on Maudlin Street, I say
"goodbye house-forever!"
I never stole a happy hour
around here
Where the world's ugliest boy
became what you see
here I am - the ugliest man
Its the last night on Maudlin Street
and truly I do love you
oh, truly I do love you
When I sleep with that picture of
you framed beside my bed
oh, it's childish and it's silly
but I think it's you in my room
by the bed (...yes, I told you it was silly...)
and I know
I took strange pills
but I never meant to hurt you
oh truly I love you
I came home late one night
everyone had gone to bed
nobody stays up for you
when you have sixteen stitches
all around your head
the last buss I missed to Maudlin Street
so, he drove me home in the Van
complaining: "Women only like me for my mind..."
don't leave your torch behind
power-cuts ahead
as we crept through the park
but no I cannot steal a pair of jeans
off a clothesline for you
but you...without clothes
oh I could not keep a straight face
me - without clothes?
well a nation turns its back and gags...
I'm packed
I am moving house
a half-life disappears today
every slag waves me on
(secretly wishing me gone
well, I will be soon
oh - I will be soon)
There were bad times on Maudlin Street
when they took you away in a police car
dear Inspector - don't you know?
don't you care?
don't you know - about Love?
Your gran died
and your mother died
on Maudlin Street
in pain and ashamed
with never time to say
those special things
I took the keys from Maudlin Street
well, it's only bricks and mortar!
and...truly I do love you
wherever you are
wherever you are

 

SUEDHEAD

Why do you come here
why do you hang around
I'm so sorry
I'm so sorry
Why do you come here
when you know it makes
things hard for me
when you know, oh
why do you come?
Why do you telephone?
and why send me silly notes?
I'm so sorry
I'm so sorry
why do you come here
when you know it makes
thing hard for me
when you know, oh
why do you come?
You had to sneak into my room
'just' to read my diary
was it just to see all the things
you knew I'd written about you?
and...so many illustrations
I'm so very sickened
oh, I am so sickened NOW

 

BREAK UP THE FAMILY

The strange logic of your clumsiest line
stayed emblazoned on my mind
break up the family
and lets begin to live our lives
I went to see all my friends tonight
it wasn't Youth, it wasn't even Life
born Old, sadly wise
resigned (well, we were)
to ending our lives
I'm so glad to grow older
to move away from those awful times
I want to see all my friends tonight
Yes you found love but you weren't
at peace with your life
home late, full of Hate
despise the ties that bind
oh I'm so glad to grow older
to move away from those younger years
now I'm in love for the first time
and I don't feel bad
Let me see all my old friends
let me put my arm around them
because I really do love them
now, does that sound mad?
Captain of games, solid framed
I stood on the touchline
hailstones, driven home
in his car - no breaks? I don't mind
I'm just so glad to grow older
to move away from those darker years
I'm in love for the first time
and I don't feel bad
so wish me luck my friends
goodbye

 

HAIRDRESSER ON FIRE

Here is London
here is London
is it home of the free,
or what?
can you squeeze me
into an empty page of your diary
and psychologically save me
I've got faith in you
I sense the power
in the fingers
within an hour the power
can totally destroy me
or it could same my life
here is London
'home of the brash, outrageous
and free'
you are repressed
but you're remarkably dressed
is it Real?
but you're far to busy
busy scissors
busy clippers
hair dresser on fire
all around Sloane Square
and you're far too busy
to see me
"busy,busy"
hairdresser on fire
was a client over-cautious
he made you nervous
and when he said
"I'm gonna sue you"
I really felt for you
so can you squeeze me
into an empty page of your diary
and supernaturally change me
CHANGE ME, CHANGE ME

 

THE ORDINARY BOYS

Ordinary boys, happy knowing nothing
happy being no one, but themselves
Ordinary girls, supermarket clothes
who think it's very clever to be cruel to you
for you were so different
you stood all alone
and you knew
that it had to be so
avoiding ordinary boys
happy going nowhere, just around here
in their rattling cars
and ordinary girls
never seeing further
than the cold, small streets
that trap them
but you were so different
you had to say no
when those empty fools
tried to change you, and claim you
for the lair of their ordinary world
where they feel so lucky
so lucky, so lucky
with their lives laid out before them
they're so lucky, so lucky
so lucky, so lucky

 

I DON'T MIND IF YOU FORGET ME

I don't mind
I don't mind if you forget me
having learned my lesson
I never left an impression on anyone
so now you send me your hardened 'regards'
when once you'd send me 'love'
sincerely I must tell you
your mild 'best wishes'
they make me suspicious
but I don't mind
I don't mind if you forget me
having learned my lesson
I never left
an impression on anyone
the pressure to change, to move on
was strange
and very strong
so this is why I tell you
I really do understand
BYE BYE
I don't mind if you forget me
no no no no no no no
REJECTION IS ONE THING
BUT REJECTION FROM A FOOL
IS CRUEL
REJECTION IS ONE THING
BUT REJECTION FROM A FOOL
IS CRUEL
and I don't mind if you forget me
I don't mind if your forget me

 

DIAL-A-CLICHE

Further into the fog I fall
well, I was just
following you!
when you said:
"Do as I do and scrap your fey ways"
(dial-a-cliche)
"grow up, be a man, and close your mealy-mouth!"
(dial-a-cliche)
But the person underneath
where does he go?
does he slide by the wayside?
or...does he just die?
when you find that you've organized
your feelings, for people
who didn't like you then
and certainly don't like you now
yet still you say:
"Do as I do and scrap your fey ways"
(dial-a-cliche)
"grow up, be a man, and close your mealy-mouth!"
(dial-a-cliche)
"the Safe way is the only way!
there's always time to change, son!"
yes well I've changed
but I'm in pain!
dial-a-chiche

 

MARGARET ON THE GUILLOTINE

The kind people
have a wonderful dream
Margaret on the guillotine
because people like you
make me feel so tired
when will you die?
when will you die?
when will you die?
when will you die?
when will you die?
because people like you
make me feel so old inside
please die
and kind people
do not shelter this dream
make it real
make the dream real
make the dream real
make it real

 

OUR FRANK

Our frank and open
deep conversations
they get me nowhere
they bring me down, so
give it a rest, won't you?
give me a cigarette
God give me patience
just no more conversation
Give us a drink
and make it quick
or else I'm gonna be sick
sick all over
your frankly vulgar
red pullover
now see how the colours blend
Our frank and open
deep conversations
they get me nowhere
they bring me down, so
give it a rest, won't you?
now will you just give over
the world may be ending
but look, I'm only human
Give us a drink
and make it quick
or else I'm gonna be sick
all over
your frankly vulgar
red pullover
now see how the two colours blend
Won't somebody stop me
from thinking all the time
about everything
so deeply
so bleakly

 

ASIAN RUT

Day oh so late
strangely the sun still shone
oh Asian boy
what are you on?
Day oh so late
strangely the sun still shone
what drugs are you on?
Tooled-up Asian boy
has come here to avenge
the cruel, cold killing
of his very best friend
Tooled-up Asian boy
has come here to take revenge
for the cruel, cold killing
of his only friend
Peace through the school
so quiet in the hall
it's a strange sign for one
of what's to come
Tough and hard and pale
oh they may just impale you on railings
oh English boys
it must be wrong
three against one?
Brakes slammed, and
a gun jammed, and
as far as I could tell
brave Asian boy
dealt a blow and fell
I'm just passing through here
on my way to somewhere civilised
and maybe I'll even arrive
maybe I'll even arrive?

 

SING YOUR LIFE

Sing your life
any fool can think of words that rhyme
many others do
why don't you?
do you want to?
Sing your life
just walk right up to the microphone
and name
all the things that you love
all the things that you loathe
sing your life
all the things that you love
all the things that you loathe
oh sing your life
oh sing your life
Others sang your life
but now's your chance to shine
and have the pleasure of
saying what you mean
the rare pleasure of
meaning what you sing
oh, make no mistake, my friend
all of this will end
so sing it now
all the things you love
all the things you loathe
oh sing your life
all the things that you love
all the things that you loathe
oh sing your, oh sing your
Don't leave it all unsaid
somewhere in the wasteland of your head
and make no mistake, my friend
your pointless life will end
but before you go
can you look at the truth?
You have a lovely singing voice
a lovely singing voice
and all of those
who sing on key
they stole the notion
from you and me

 

MUTE WITNESS

Your poor witness
crying so loudly on the floor
oh but she's only trying to tell you
what it was that she saw
she is only trying to tell you
what it was that she saw
Now see her standing on the table
with her small arms flailing
and you feel such compassion
in your soul for
Your poor mute witness
still testing the strength
of our patience
oh but she's only trying to tell you
what it was that she saw
Now see her pointing to the frisbee
with a memory too fuzzy
as her silent words
describe the fright of last night
4 a.m. Norhtside, Clapham Common
who knows what she was doing there?
will she sketch the answer later?
Well, I'll ask her
"now dry your tears, my dear"
Now see her mime in time so nicely
it would all have been so clear
is only she had never volunteered
"your taxi is here, my dear"

 

KING LEER

Your boyfriend, he
went down on one knee
well, could it be
he's only got one knee?
I tried to surprise you
with Vodka
or, Tizer
I can't quite remember
but you didn't thank me
you didn't even thank me
because you never do
Your boyfriend, he
has the gift of the gab
or, could it be
the gift of the grab?
I tried to surprise you
I lay down beside you
and...nothing much happened
and you didn't phone me
you didn't even phone me
because it's not your style
to dial
Your boyfriend, he
displays to me
more than just
a hint of cruelty
I tried to surprise you
I crept up behind you
with a homeless chihuahua
you gushed for an hour
you handed him back and said
"You'll never guess
I'm bored now"

 

FOUND FOUND FOUND

found found found found found found
someone who's worth it
in this murkiness
someone who's never
seeming scheming
found found found found found found
someone who's worth it
in this murkiness
someone who's never
seeming scheming
Oh, but if I'd never found
oh, but if I'd never found
oh, but if I'd never found
I do believe that
the more you give your love
and I do believe that
the more you offer trust
the more you chase
the more you cry
the more you're bound to lose
the more you're bound to lose
Oh, but if I'd never found
oh, but if I'd never found
somebody
who wants to be
who wants to be
with me
all the time

 

DRIVING YOUR GIRLFRIEND HOME

I'm driving
your girlfriend home
and she's saying
how she never chose you
"turn left", she says
so I turn left
and she says
"So how did I end up
so deeply involved in
the very existence
I planned on avoiding?"
and I can't answer
I'm driving
your girlfriend home
and she's laughing
to stop herself crying
"drive on", she says
so I drive on
and she says
"So how did I end up
attached to this person
when his sense of humour
gets gradually worser?"
and I can't tell her
I'm parking
outside her home
and we're shaking hands
goodnight, so politely

 

THE HARSH TRUTH OF THE CAMERA EYE

Churchillian legs
hair barely there
the harsh truth of the camera eye
Your eyes signal pain
because of the strain
of smiling
the harsh truth of the camera eye
telling you all
that you never wnated to know
showing what
you didn't want shown
My so friendly lens
zooms into
"the inner you"
and it tells the harsh truth
and nothing but
Laugh with us all here
that's if you can
then take the pictures home
and screamtelling you all
that you never wanted to know
showing you what
you didn't want shown
This photographer
he must have really had it in for you
"Oh, I don't want
to be judged anymore
I don't wnat to be judged
I would sooner be Loved
I would sooner be
just blindly Loved..."

 

(I'M) THE END OF THE FAMILY LINE

With no complications
fifteen generations
(of mine)
all honouring Nature
until I arrive
(with incredible style)
I'm the end fo the line
the end of the family line
the end of the line
No baby pulled screaming
out into this seething whirl
by chance or whim
(or even love?)
our family tree hacked into decline
and I'm spared the pain
of ever saying
("goodbye")
I'm the end of the line
the end of the family line
the end of the line

 

THERE'S A PLACE IN HELL FOR ME AND MY FRIENDS

There is a place
reserved
for me and my friends
and when we go
we all will go
so you see
I'm never alone
there is a place
with a bit more time
and a few more
gentler words
and looking back
we do forgive
(we had no choice
we always did)
all that we hope
is that when we go
our skin
and our blood
and our bones
don't get in your way
making you ill
the way they did
when we lived
There is a place
a place in hell
reserved
for me and my friends
and if ever I
wanted to cry
then I will
because I can

 

TONY THE PONY

Still drinking on the corner 
Just don't say I didn't warn you 
Always nagging big brother 
He's only looking out for you 
Tony The Pony 
Tony The Pony 
You're still standing on the corner 
Just don't say I didn't warn you 
Old and jealous big brother 
You had your time and you spent it 
Crying 
Now, Tony The Pony 
Tony The Pony 
So, that's what they call you now ? 
When you're free outside 
So cold and hard and in control 
And ... 
There's a free ride on 
Tony The Pony 
Oh, why do you always wanna stop me 
From doing the things in life that make me happy ? 
And when I'm outside with friends, laughing loudly 
Why do you always wanna stop me ? 
Oh, I would never 
I would never 
But you will carry the can for anyone 
The free ride on 
Gullible Tony 
You're drunker quicker 
And you're sicker even quicker 
For something heavy is gonna fall on you 
Oh ... 
And what do they call you now ? 
When you're free outside 
So cold and hard and in control 
And, oh ... been a lark 
There's a free ride on 
Fucked-up Tony 
I will never say I told you so 
Or how I knew that something bad 
Would happen to you 
I don't wanna say I told you so 
Oh, but Tony, I told you so !!! 
I told you so

 

YOU'RE GONNA NEED SOMEONE ON YOUR SIDE

With the world's fate 
Resting on your shoulder 
You're gonna need 
Someone on your side 
You can't do it by yourself 
Any longer 
You're gonna need 
Someone on your side 
Someone kindly told me 
That you'd wasted 
Eight of nine lives
Oh, give yourself a break 
Before you break down 
You're gonna need someone on your side 
And here I am, And here I am 
Well, you don't need 
To look so pleased ! 
Day or night, 
There is no difference 
You're gonna need someone on your side 
Day or night, 
There is no difference 
You're gonna need someone soon 
And here I am, And here I am 
Well, you don't need 
To look so pleased

 

GLAMOROUS GLUE

First day with the jar 
You find 
Everyone lies 
First day with the jar 
You find 
Everyone lies, nobody minds 
Everyone lies 
Where is the man you respect ? 
And where is the woman you love ? 
Where's the woman you love ? 
Third week with the jar
You find 
Everything dies 
We won't vote Conservative 
Because we never have 
Everyone lies, everyone lies 
Where is the man you respect ? 
And where is the woman you love ? 
Where's the woman you love ? 
Everything of worth 
On Earth Is there To share 
I used to dream, and I used to vow 
I wouldn't dream of it now 
We look to Los Angeles 
For the language we use 
London is dead, London is dead, London is dead...
Now I'm too much in love 
I'm too much in love 
I know 
I'll go 
Empty hand 
From the land

 

WE'LL LET YOU KNOW

How sad are we ? 
And how sad have we been ? 
We'll let you know 
We'll let you know 
Oh, but only if - you're really interested 
You wonder how 
We've stayed alive 'till now 
We'll let you know 
We'll let you know 
But only if - you're really interested 
We're all smiles 
Then, honest, I swear, it's the turnstiles 
That make us hostile 
Oh ... 
We will descend 
On anyone unable to defend 
Themselves 
Oh ... 
And the songs we sing 
They're not supposed to mean a thing 
La, la, la, la ... 
Oh ...You're lonely, Oh ... you're lonely, Oh ... 
GET OFF THE ROOF ! Oh ... 
Your Arsenal !
We may seem cold, or 
We may even be 
The most depressing people you've ever known 
At heart, what's left, we sadly know 
That we are the last truly British people you'll ever know 
We are the last truly British people you will ever know 
You'll never never want to know

 

THE NATIONAL FRONT DISCO

David, the wind blows 
The wind blows ... 
Bits of your life away 
Your friends all say ... 
"Where is our boy ? Oh, we've lost our boy" 
But they should know 
Where you've gone 
Because again and again you've explained that 
You're going to ... 
Oh, you're going to ... 
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah 
England for the English ! 
England for the English ! 
David, the winds blow 
The winds blow ...
All of my dreams away 
And I still say : 
"Where is our boy ? Ah, we've lost our boy" 
But I should know 
Why you've gone 
Because again and again you've explained
You've gone to the ... 
National, ah ... 
To the National .. 
There's a country; you don't live there 
But one day you would like to 
And if you show them what you're made of 
Oh, then you might do ... 
But David, we wonder 
We wonder if the thunder 
Is ever really gonna begin 
Begin, begin 
Your mom says : 
"I've lost my boy" 
But she should know 
Why you've gone 
Because again and again you've explained 
You've gone to the : 
National 
To the National 
To the National Front Disco 
Because you want the day to come sooner 
You want the day to come sooner 
You want the day to come sooner 
When you've settled the score 
Oh, the National 
Oh, the National

 

CERTAIN PEOPLE I KNOW

I take the cue from 
Certain people I know 
I use the cue 
And then I 
Hand it on to you 
And when I swing it 
So, it catches his eye ... 
(Weren't you there ? 
- You'd have died !) 
I trust the views of 
Certain people I know 
They look at Danger 
And they 
LAUGH THEIR HEADS OFF 
Their clothes are Imitation 
George the 23rd 
(Don't you find this absurd ?) 
I'd hate to be like 
Certain people I know 
They break their necks 
And can't afford to
Get them fixed 
Ah, they'd sacrifice all 
Of their principles for 
anything cashable 
I do believe it's terrible 
Oh, wo, wo, Ah, ah, ah, ah, Oh, wo, wo...

 

WE HATE IT WHEN OUR FRIENDS BECOME SUCCESSFUL

We hate it when our friends become successful 
We hate it when our friends become successful 
Oh, look at those clothes 
Now look at that face, it's so old 
And such a video ! 
Well, it's really laughable 
Ha, ha, ha ...
We hate it when our friends become successful 
And if they're Northern, that makes it even worse
And if we can destroy them 
You bet your life we will 
Destroy them 
If we can hurt them 
Well, we may as well ... 
It's really laughable 
Ha, ha, ha ... 
You see, it should've been me 
It could've been me 
Everybody knows 
Everybody says so 
They say : 
"Ah, you have loads of songs 
So many songs 
More songs than they'd stand 
Verse 
Chorus 
Middle eight 
Break, fade 
Just listen ..."
La, la-la, la-la

SEASICK, YET STILL DOCKED

I am a poor freezingly cold soul 
So far from where 
I intended to go 
Scavenging through life's very constant lulls 
So far from where I'm determined to go 
Wish I knew the way to reach the one I love
There is no way ... 
Wish I had the charm to attract the one I love 
But you see, I've got no charm 
Mmm...
Tonight I've consumed much more than I can hold 
Oh, this is very clear to you 
And you can tell I have never really loved 
You can tell, by the way, I sleep all day
And all of my life no-one gave me anything 
No-one has ever given me anything 
My love is as sharp as a needle in your eye 
You must be such a fool 
To pass me by

 

I KNOW IT'S GONNA HAPPEN SOMEDAY

My love, wherever you are 
Whatever you are 
Don't lose faith 
I know it's gonna happen someday 
To you 
Please wait ... Please wait ... Oh ... Wait ... 
Don't lose faith 
You say that the day just never arrives 
And it's never seemed so far away 
Still, I know it's gonna happen someday 
To you 
Please wait ... 
Don't lose faith

 

TOMORROW

Tomorrow 
Will it really come ? 
And if it does come 
Will I still be Human ? 
All I ask of you is one thing that you never do 
Would you put your arms around me ? 
(I won't tell anyone) 
Tomorrow 
Does it have to come ?
All I ask of you is one thing that you'll never do 
Would you put your arms around me ? 
(I won't tell anybody) 
Tomorrow 
And what must come before ...
Oh, the pain in my arms 
Oh, the pain in my legs 
Ooh, my shiftless body 
Tomorrow 
It's surely nearer now ? 
You don't think I'll make it 
I never said I wanted to ! 
Well did I ? 
Oh, the pain in my arms 
Oh, the pain in my legs 
Oh, yeah; oh, yeah, No, yeah; no, yeah 
Through my shiftless body 
Tomorrow, Tomorrow 
All I ask of you ... oh ... 
Is : would you tell me that you love me 
Tell me, tell me that you love me, Tell me, tell me that you love me ... 
Ah, I know you don't mean it 
Ah, I know you don't mean it 
Tell me, tell me that you love me, Tell me, tell me that you love me ...

 

YOU'RE THE ONE FOR ME, FATTY

NOVEMBER SPAWNED A MONSTER

Sleep on and dream of Love
because it's the closest you will get to love
poor twisted child, so ugly, so ugly
poor twisted child, oh hug me, oh hug me
one November spawned a monster 
in the shape of this child who later cried
"But Jesus made me, so Jesus save me from
pity, sympathy and people discussing me"
a frame of useless limbs what can make GOOD
all the BAD that's been done?
And if the lights were out
could you even bear
to kiss her full on the mouth (or anywhere?)
poor twisted child, so ugly, so ugly
poor twisted child, oh hug me, oh hug me
one November spawned a monster 
in the shape of this child who must remain
a hostage to kindess and the wheels underneath her
a hostage to kindess and the wheels underneath her
a symbol of where mad, mad lovers
must PAUSE and draw the line
So sleep and dream of love
because it's the closest
you will get to love
that November is a time which I must put OUT of my mind
oh one fine day 
LET IT BE SOON
she won't be rich or beautiful
but she'll be walking your streets
in the clothes that she went out
and chose for herself

 

SEASICK, YET STILL DOCKED

I am a poor freezingly cold soul 
So far from where 
I intended to go 
Scavenging through life's very constant lulls 
So far from where I'm determined to go 
Wish I knew the way to reach the one I love
There is no way ... 
Wish I had the charm to attract the one I love

THE LOOP

I just wanna say 
I haven't been away 
I'm still right here 
Where I always was 
So one day, if you're bored 
By all means call 
Because you can do 
(But only if you want to) 
I just wanna say 
I haven't been away 
I am still right here 
Where I always was 
So one day, when you're bored 
By all means call 
Because you can do 
But you might not get through

 

SISTER I'M A POET

All over this town 
Yes, a low wind may blow 
And I can see through everybo... 
With no reason 
To hide these words I feel 
And no reason 
To talk about the books I read 
But still I do 
That's 'cause I'm a ... Sister I'm a ... 
All over this town 
Along this way 
Outside the prison gates 
I love the romance of crime 
And I wonder 
Does anybody feel the way I do ? 
And is evil just something you are 
Or something you do ? 
Sister I'm a ... Sister I'm a ... 
All over this town, All over this town 
They pull over 
In their Citroen vans 
Not to shake your hand 
With meths on their breaths 
And you with youth on your side 
A plastic bag stranded at the lights 
This once was me ...
But now I'm a ... Sister I'm a ...
All over this town ... Oh, oh, oh 
All over this town, All over this town, Oh ... 
I still cannot speak French ... I am very lazy

 

JACK THE RIPPER

Oh, you look so tired 
Mouth slack and wide 
Ill-housed and ill-advised 
Your face is as mean 
As your life has been 
Crash into my arms 
I WANT YOU 
You don't agree -
But you don't refuse 
I know you 
And I know a place 
Where no one is likely to pass 
Oh, you don't care if it's late 
And you don't care if you're lost 
And oh, you look so tired 
(But tonight you presumed too much) 
Too much, too much 
And if it's the last 
Thing I ever do 
I'M GONNA GET YOU 
Crash into my arms 
I WANT YOU 
You don't agree -
But you don't refuse 
I know you 
And no one knows a thing about my life 
I can come and go as I please 
And if I want to, I can stay 
Oh, or if I want to, I can leave 
Nobody knows me, Nobody knows me, Nobody knows me Oh, oh...

 

SUCH A LITTLE THING MAKES SUCH A BIG DIFFERENCE

Such a little thing, such a little thing
but the difference it made was grave
there you go
wielding a bicycle chain
oh why won't you change
cange and be nicer?
such a little thing
a gentle tone of kindness
or written words on paper
- can you write?
How I love all of
the very simple things of life
(God's good air)
how I love all of
the very simple things of life
such a little thing
a fumbling politeness
the difference it saved me
wielding a bicycle chain
"I WILL NOT CHANGE AND I WILL NOT BE NICE"
Most people keep their brains between your legs (don't you find?)
Leave me alone - I was only singing, leave me alone because
I was only singing
leave me alone - I was only singing, leave me alone
you have just proved (again)
MOST PEOPLE KEEP THEIR BRAINS BETWEEN THEIR LEGS

 

I KNOW IT'S GONNA HAPPEN SOMEDAY

My love, wherever you are 
Whatever you are 
Don't lose faith 
I know it's gonna happen someday 
To you 
Please wait ... 
Please wait ... 
Oh ... Wait ... 
Don't lose faith 
You say that the day just never arrives 
And it's never seemed so far away 
Still, I know it's gonna happen someday 
To you 
Please wait ... 
Don't lose faith

 

WE'LL LET YOU KNOW

How sad are we ? 
And how sad have we been ? 
We'll let you know, We'll let you know 
Oh, but only if - you're really interested 
You wonder how 
We've stayed alive 'till now 
We'll let you know, We'll let you know 
But only if - you're really interested 
We're all smiles 
Then, honest, I swear, it's the turnstiles 
That make us hostile 
Oh ... We will descend 
On anyone unable to defend 
Themselves 
Oh ... And the songs we sing 
They're not supposed to mean a thing 
La, la, la, la ... Oh ...
You're lonely, Oh ... you're lonely 
Oh ... 
GET OFF THE ROOF !
Oh ... Your Arsenal !
We may seem cold, or 
We may even be 
The most depressing people you've ever known 
At heart, what's left, we sadly know 
That we are the last truly British people you'll ever know 
We are the last truly British people you will ever know 
You'll never never want to know

 

SUEDHEAD

Why do you come here
why do you hang around
I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry
Why do you come here
when you know it makes
things hard for me
when you know, oh
why do you come?
Why do you telephone?
and why send me silly notes?
I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry
why do you come here
when you know it makes
thing hard for me
when you know, oh
why do you come?
You had to sneak into my room
'just' to read my diary
was it just to see all the things
you knew I'd written about you?
and...so many illustrations
I'm so very sickened
oh, I am so sickened NOW

 

HE KNOWS I'D LOVE TO SEE HIM

He Knows (he knows)
Or, I think he does
because when I lived
in the Arse of the world...
he knows, he knows, he knows I'd love
to see him happy (or as close as is allowed)
because when I lived
in the Arse of the world
he knows, he knows, he knows I'd love
to see him happy (or as close as possible
as close as possible, as close as is allowed)
My name still conjours up deadly deeds
and a bad taste in the mouth
the police - they actually knew me
they said:
"You're just another person in the world
you're just another fool with radical views
you're just another who has maddening views
you want to turn it on its head
by staying in bed!"
I said: "I know I do"

 

YOU'RE GONNA NEED SOMEONE ON YOUR SIDE

With the world's fate 
Resting on your shoulder 
You're gonna need 
Someone on your side 
You can't do it by yourself 
Any longer 
You're gonna need 
Someone on your side 
Someone kindly told me 
That you'd wasted 
Eight of nine lives
Oh, give yourself a break 
Before you break down 
You're gonna need someone on your side 
And here I am, And here I am 
Well, you don't need 
To look so pleased ! 
Day or night, 
There is no difference 
You're gonna need someone on your side 
Day or night, 
There is no difference 
You're gonna need someone soon 
And here I am, And here I am 
Well, you don't need 
To look so pleased

 

GLAMOROUS GLUE

First day with the jar 
You find 
Everyone lies 
First day with the jar 
You find 
Everyone lies, nobody minds, Everyone lies 
Where is the man you respect ? 
And where is the woman you love ? 
Where's the woman you love ? 
Third week with the jar
You find 
Everything dies 
We won't vote Conservative 
Because we never have 
Everyone lies, everyone lies 
Where is the man you respect ? 
And where is the woman you love ? 
Where's the woman you love ? 
Everything of worth 
On Earth, Is there, To share 
I used to dream, and I used to vow 
I wouldn't dream of it now 
We look to Los Angeles 
For the language we use 
London is dead, London is dead, London is dead, ...
Now I'm too much in love 
I'm too much in love, 
I know I'll go 
Empty hand 
From the land

 

WE HATE IT WHEN OUR FRIENDS BECOME SUCCESSFUL

We hate it when our friends become successful 
We hate it when our friends become successful 
Oh, look at those clothes 
Now look at that face, it's so old 
And such a video ! 
Well, it's really laughable 
Ha, ha, ha ...
We hate it when our friends become successful 
And if they're Northern, that makes it even worse
And if we can destroy them 
You bet your life we will 
Destroy them 
If we can hurt them 
Well, we may as well ... 
It's really laughable 
Ha, ha, ha ... 
You see, it should've been me 
It could've been me 
Everybody knows 
Everybody says so 
They say : 
"Ah, you have loads of songs 
So many songs 
More songs than they'd stand 
Verse 
Chorus 
Middle eight 
Break, fade 
Just listen ..."
La, la-la, la-la

 

NOW MY HEART IS FULL

There's gonna be some trouble 
A whole house will need re-building 
And everyone I love in the house 
Will recline on an analyst's couch quite 
Soon 
Your Father cracks a joke 
And in the usual way 
Empties the room 
Tell all of my friends 
(I don't have too many 
Just some rain-coated lovers' puny brothers)
Dallow, Spicer, Pinkie, Cubitt 
Rush to danger 
Wind up nowhere 
Patric Doonan - raised to wait 
I'm tired again, I've tried again, and 
Now my heart is full 
Now my heart is full 
And I just can't explain 
So I won't even try to
Dallow, Spicer, Pinkie, Cubitt 
Every jammy Stressford poet 
Loafing oafs in all-night chemists 
Loafing oafs in all-night chemists 
Underact - express depression 
Ah, but Bunnie I loved you 
I was tired again 
I've tried again, and 
Now my heart is full 
Now my heart is full 
And I just can't explain 
So I won't even try to 
Could you pass by ? 
Could you pass by ? 
Oh ... 
Now my heart is full 
Now my heart is full 
And I just can't explain 
So ... slow ... 
Slow ... slow ... slow ... slow ... slow ...

 

SPRING-HEELED JIM

Spring-heeled Jim winks an eye 
He'll "do", he'll never be "done to" 
He takes on whoever flew through 
"Well, it's the normal thing to do" ... ah ... 
Spring-heeled Jim lives to love 
Now kissing with his mouth full 
And his eyes on some other fool 
So many women 
His head should be spinning 
Ah, but no ! 
Ah, but no ! 
But no !
Ah, no !
Spring-heeled Jim slurs the words : 
"There's no need to be so knowing
Take life at five times the 
Average speed, like I do" 
Until Jim feels the chill 
"Oh, where did all the time go ?" 
Once always in for the kill 
Now it's too cold 
And he feels too 
old 
Too old
Mmm, old... 
La, la, la, la-la, la ...

 

BILLY BUDD

Say, Billy Budd 
So you think you should ? 
Oh, everyone's laughing 
Say, Billy Budd 
So you think that you should ? 
Everyone's laughing ! 
Since I took up with you 
Things have been bad 
Yeah, but now it's 12 years on 
Now it's 12 years on 
Yes, and I took up with you 
I took my job application 
Into town 
Did you hear ? They turned me down 
Yes, and it's all because of us 
Oh, and what was in our eyes 
Oh, what was in our eyes, yeah 
I said, Billy Budd 
I would happily lose 
Both of my legs 
I would lose both of my legs 
Oh, if it meant you could be free 
Oh, if it meant you could be free 
(Don't leave us in the dark!)

 

HOLD ON TO YOUR FRIENDS

A bond of trust 
Has been abused 
Something of value 
May be lost 
Give up your job 
Squander your cash - be rash 
Just hold on to your friends 
There are more than enough 
To fight and oppose 
Why waste good time 
Fighting the people you like 
Who will fall defending your name 
Oh, don't feel so ashamed 
To have friends 
But now you only call me 
When you're feeling depressed 
When you feel happy I'm 
So far from your mind 
My patience is stretched 
My loyalty vexed 
Oh, you're losing all of your friends 
Hold on to your friends 
Hold on to your friends 
Resist - or move on 
Be mad, be rash 
Smoke and explode 
Sell all of your clothes 
Just bear in mind : 
Oh, there just might come a time 
When you need some friends

 

THE MORE YOU IGNORE ME, THE CLOSER I GET

The more you ignore me 
The closer I get 
You're wasting your time 
The more you ignore me 
The closer I get 
You're wasting your time 
I will be 
In the bar 
With my head 
On the bar 
I am now 
A central part 
Of your mind's landscape 
Whether you care 
Or do not 
Yeah, I've made up your mind 
The more you ignore me 
The closer I get 
You're wasting your time 
The more you ignore me 
The closer I get 
You're wasting your time 
Beware !
I bear more grudges 
Than lonely high court judges 
When you sleep 
I will creep 
Into your thoughts 
Like a bad debt 
That you can't pay 
Take the easy way 
And give in 
Yeah, and let me in 
Oh, let me in 
Oh let me ... 
Oh, let me in 
IT'S WAR 
IT'S WAR 
WAR 
WAR 
Oh, let me in 
Ah, the closer I get 
Ah, you're asking for it 
Ah, the closer I get 
Ooh, the closer I ...

 

WHY DON'T YOU FIND OUT FOR YOURSELF

The sanest days are mad 
Why don't you find out for yourself ? 
Then you'll see the price 
Very closely 
Some men here 
They have a special interest 
In your career 
They wanna help you to grow 
And then syphon all your dough 
Why don't you find out for yourself ? 
Then you'll see the glass 
Hidden in the grass 
You'll never believe me, so 
Why don't you find out for yourself ? 
Sick down to my heart 
That's just the way it goes 
Some men here 
They know the full extent of 
Your distress 
They kneel and pray 
And they say : 
"Long may it last" 
Why don't you find out for yourself ?
Then you'll see the glass 
Hidden in the grass 
Bad scenes come and go 
For which you must allow 
Sick down to my heart 
That's just the way it goes 
Don't rake up my mistakes 
I know exactly what they are 
And ... what do YOU do ? 
Well ... you just SIT THERE 
I've been stabbed in the back 
So many many times 
I don't have any skin 
But that's just the way it goes

 

I AM HATED FOR LOVING

I am hated for loving 
I am hated for loving 
Anonymous call, a poison pen 
A brick in the small of the back again 
I still don't belong 
To anyone - I am mine 
And I am hated for loving 
I am haunted for wanting 
Anonymous call, a poison pen 
A brick in the ... ah ... 
A brick in the small of the back again 
I still don't belong 
To anyone - I am mine 
I am falling 
With no-one to catch me 
I am falling 
And there's still 
No-one to catch me 
Ah .. 
Anonymous call, a poison pen 
A brick in the ... ah ... 
A brick in the small of the back again 
I just don't belong 
To anywhere 
I just don't belong 
Mmm ... 
Ah ...

 

LIFEGUARD SLEEPING, GIRL DROWNING

Always looking for attention 
Always needs to be mentioned 
Who does she 
Think she should be ? 
The shrill cry through darkening air 
Doesn't she know he's 
Had such a busy day ? 
Tell her ... sshhh
Somebody tell her ... sshhh 
Slowest ... 
It was only a test 
But she swam too far 
Against the tide 
She deserves all she gets 
The sky became marked with stars 
As an out-stretched arm slowly 
Disappears 
Hooray 
Oh hooray 
No, oh, oh, woh, there's no movement 
No, oh, hooray 
Oh, hooray 
Please don't worry 
There'll be no fuss 
She was ... nobody's nothing 
(What's your name ?) 
When he awoke 
The sea was calm 
And another day passes like a dream 
There's no ... no way 
(What's your name ?)

 

USED TO BE A SWEET BOY

Used to be a sweet boy 
Holding so tightly 
To Daddy's hand 
But that was all 
In some distant land 
Blazer and tie 
And a big bright healthy smile 
Used to make all 
Of our trials worthwhile 
Used to be a sweet boy 
And I'm not to blame 
Something went wrong 
And I know 
I'm not to blame 
Something went wrong 
Can't be to blame 
Ah ...

 

THE LAZY SUNBATHERS

A world war 
Was announced 
Days ago 
But they didn't know 
The lazy sunbathers 
The lazy sunbathers 
The sun burns through 
To the planet's core 
And it isn't enough 
They want more 
Nothing 
Appears 
To be 
Between the ears of 
The lazy sunbathers 
Too jaded 
To question stagnation 
The sun burns through 
To the planet's core 
And it isn't enough 
They want more 
Religions fall 
Children shelled 
"...Children shelled ? That's all 
Very well, but would you 
Please keep the noise 
Down low ? 
Because you're waking 
The lazy sunbathers ..."
Oh, the lazy sunbathers 
The lazy sunbathers

 

SPEEDWAY

And when you slam 
Down the hammer 
Can you see it in your heart ? 
All of the rumours 
Keeping me grounded 
I never said, I never said that they were 
Completely unfounded 
So when you slam 
Down the hammer 
Can you see it in your heart ? 
Can you delve so low ? 
And when you're standing 
On my fingers 
Can you see it in your heart ? ... ah ... 
And when you try 
To break my spirit 
It won't work 
Because there's nothing left to break 
Anymore 
All of the rumours 
Keeping me grounded 
I never said, I never said that they were 
Completely unfounded 
You won't sleep 
Until the earth that wants me 
Finally has me 
Oh you've done it now 
You won't rest 
Until the hearse that becomes me 
Finally takes me 
Oh you've done it now 
And you won't smile 
Until my loving mouth 
Is shut good and proper 
FOREVER 
All of the rumours 
Keeping me grounded 
I never said, I never said that they were 
Completely unfounded 
And all those lies 
Written lies, twisted lies 
Well, they weren't lies 
They weren't lies 
They weren't lies 
I never said 
I never said 
I could have mentioned your name 
I could have dragged you in 
Guilt by implication 
By association 
I've always been true to you 
In my own strange way 
I've always been true to you 
In my own sick way 
I'll always stay true to you

 

THE TEACHERS ARE AFRAID OF THE PUPILS

There's too many people 
Planning your downfall 
When your spirit's on trial 
These nights can be frightening 
Sleep transports sadness 
To some other mid-brain 
And somebody here 
Will not be here next year 
So you stand by the board 
Full of fear and intention 
And, if you think that they're listening 
Well, you've got to be joking 
Oh, you understand change 
And you think it's essential 
But when your profession 
Is humiliation 
Say the wrong word to our children ...
We'll have you, oh yes, we'll have you 
Lay a hand on our children 
And it's never too late to have you 
Mucus on your collar 
A nail up through the staff chair 
A blade in your soap 
And you cry into your pillow 
To be finished would be a relief 
To be finished would be a relief... 
Say the wrong word to our children ...
We'll have you, oh yes, we'll have you 
Lay a hand on our children 
And it's never too late to have you 
To be finished would be a relief 
To be finished would be a relief...
I'm very glad this thing has come 
Sometimes I'm so glad 
Never bother to play the tunes 
I've seen it coming for dear life

 

READER MEET AUTHOR

You don't know a thing about their lives 
They live where you wouldn't dare to drive
You shake as you think of how they sleep 
But you write as if you are my side-by-side 
Reader, meet Author 
With the hope of hearing sense 
But you may be feeling let down 
By the words of defence 
He says : "No-one ever sees me when I cry"
You don't know a thing about their lives 
Books don't save them, books aren't Stanley knives 
And if a fight broke out here tonight 
You'd be the first away, because you're that type 
And the Year 2000 won't change anyone here 
As each fabled promise flies so fast 
You'll swear it was never there 
Oh, have you ever escaped from a shipwrecked life ? 
So safely with your software; all miles from the front line 
You hear the way their sad voices, and you start to imagine things 
Oh, any excuse to write more lies

 

THE BOY RACER

He's just too good-natured and 
He's got too much money and 
He's got too many girlfriends 
I'm jealous, that's all 
Have you seen him go, though, oh ? 
Have you seen him go, though, oh ? 
Boy racer, Boy racer, oh 
We're gonna kill this pretty thing 
Boy racer, Boy racer, oh 
We're gonna kill this pretty thing

Boy racer, Boy racer, oh 
We're gonna kill this pretty thing 
Boy racer, Boy racer, oh 
We're gonna kill this pretty thing 
He thinks he got the whole world in his hands 
Stood at the urinal 
He thinks he got the whole world in his hands 
And I'm gonna ... kill him !
Oh, no ! Oh, no ! Oh, no ! Oh, no ! Oh, no !Oh .... 
Boy racer Boy racer, oh 
We're gonna kill this pretty thing...
He's just too good-looking, and, And, and ... 
Boy racer Boy racer, oh 
We're gonna kill this pretty thing...

 

THE OPERATION

You fight with your right hand 
And caress with your left hand 
Everyone I know is sick to death of you 
With a tear that's a mile wide 
In the kite that you're flying 
Everyone I know is sick to death of you 
Ever since 
You don't look the same 
You're just not the same, no way 
You say clever things and 
You never used to 
You don't catch what I'm saying 
When you're deafened to advice 
Everyone here is sick to the 
Back teeth of you 
With a tear that's a mile wide 
In the kite that you're flying 
Everyone here is sick to the 
Tattoo of you 
Ever since 
You don't look the same 
You're just not the same, no way 
You say pleasant things and 
There is no need to
Still, you fight with your right hand 
And caress with your left hand 
Ooh, ooh ... Sad to say ... 
How once I was in love with you 
Sad to say ... 
You don't catch what I'm saying 
When you're deafened to advice 
Ooh, ooh ... Ever since 
You don't look the same 
You're just not the same, no way 
What the hell have 
They stuck into you ?

 

DAGENHAM DAVE

Head in the clouds, and a mouthful of pie 
Head in a blouse, everybody loves him 
I see why 
Dagenham Dave, Dagenham Dave, Oh, Dagenham Dave 
Dagenham Dave, Dagenham Dave, Oh, Dagenham Dave 
"I love Karen, I love Sharon" on the windowscreen 
With never the need to fight or to question a single thing 
Dagenham Dave, Dagenham Dave Oh, Dagenham Dave 
Dagenham Dave, Dagenham Dave Oh, Dagenham Dave ...
He'd love to touch, he's afraid that he might self-combust 
I could say more, but you get the general idea

Oh, Dave, oh, Dagenham, dagenham, Oh, Dave, oh, Dave, ...

 

DO YOUR BEST AND DON'T WORRY

Compare the best of their days 
With the worst of your days 
You won't win 
With your standards so high 
And your spirits so low 
At least remember ... 
This is you on a bad day, you on a pale day 
Just do your best and don't ... Don't worry, oh 
The way you hang yourself is oh, so unfair 
See the best of how they look 
Against the worst of how you are
And again, you won't win 
With your standards so high 
And your spirits so low 
At least remember ... 
This is you on a drab day, you in a drab dress 
Just do your best and don't ... Don't worry, oh 
The way you hang yourself is oh, so unfair 
Just do your best and don't ... Don't worry, oh 
The way you watch yourself is oh, so unfair 
Just do your best and don't ... Don't worry, oh 
Do your best and don't ...

SOUTHPAW

You were a boy before you became a man 
I don't see the joy 
And you ran with your pals in the sun 
You turned around and they were gone 
Again ... 
A sick boy should be treated 
So easily defeated 
Oh, I just don't understand 
So you ran with your pals in the sun 
You turned around 
You were alone 
Again ... 
And you ran back to Ma 
Which set the pace for the rest of your days 
Oh, you ran back to Ma 
Which set the pace for the rest of your days 
Oh, you ran back to Ma 
Which set the pace for the rest of your days 
And now, there is something that you should know 
There is something that you should know 
The girl of your dreams is 
Here all alone 
Girl of your dreams is 
Here all alone 
The girl of your dreams is 
Sad and all alone 
The girl of your dreams is 
Here all alone 
There is something that you should know 
There is something that you should know 
Girl of your dreams is 
Here all alone 
The girl of your dreams is 
Sad and is all alone 
The girl of your dreams is 
Sad and is feeling all alone 
Oh, there is something that you should know 
Help me, help me, help me ...

 

MALADJUSTED

I wanna start from 
Before the beginning 
Loot wine, "Be mine, and 
Then let's stay out for the night"
Ride via Parkside 
Semi-perilous lives 
Jeer the lights in the windows 
Of all safe and stable homes 
(But wondering then, well what 
Could peace of mind be like ?)
Anyway do you want to hear 
Our story, or not ? 
As the Fulham Road lights 
Stretch and invite into the night 
From a Stevenage overspill 
We'd kill to live around 
SW6 - with someone like you 
Keep thieves' hours 
With someone like you 
...As long as it slides 
You stalk the house 
In a low-cut blouse : 
"Oh Christ, another stifled 
Friday night !"
And the Fulham Road lights 
Stretch and invite into the night 
Well, I was fifteen 
What could I know ?
When the gulf between 
All the things I need 
And the things I receive 
Is an ancient ocean 
Wide, wild, lost, uncrossed 
Still I maintain there's nothing 
Wrong with you 
You do all that you do 
Because it's all you can do 
Well, I was fifteen 
Where could I go ?
With a soul full of loathing 
For stinging bureaucracy 
Making it anything 
Other than easy 
For working girls like me 
With my hands on my head 
I flop on your bed 
With a head full of dread 
For all I've ever said 
Maladjusted, maladjusted 
Maladjusted maladjusted 
Never to be trusted 
Oh, never to be trusted 
There's nothing wrong with you, oh 
...There's nothing wrong with you

 

ALMA MATTERS

So : the choice I have made 
May seem strange to you 
But who asked you, anyway ? 
It's my life to wreck 
My own way 
You see : to someone, somewhere, oh yeah ... 
Alma matters 
In mind, body and soul 
In part, and in whole 
Because to someone, somewhere, oh yeah ... 
Alma matters 
In mind, body and soul 
In part, and in whole 
So the life I have made 
May seem wrong to you 
But, I've never been surer 
It's my life to ruin 
My own way 
You see : to someone, somewhere, oh yeah ... 
Alma matters 
In mind, body and soul 
In part, and in whole 
Because to someone, somewhere, oh yeah ... 
Alma matters 
In mind, body and soul 
In part, and in whole 
To someone, somewhere, oh yeah ... 
Alma matters 
In mind, body and soul 
Part, and in whole 
So to someone, somewhere, oh yeah ... 
Alma matters 
In mind, body and soul 
Part, and in whole 
To someone, somewhere, oh yeah ... 
Oh yeah ... Oh yeah, oh yeah Oh yeah ...

 

AMBITIOUS OUTSIDERS

Bolt-lock your doors 
Alarm your cars 
And still we move in closer 
Every day 
Top of the list 
Is your smiling kids 
But we'll be smiling too 
So that's OK 
Oh, and by the way 
Thank you, because you're 
Giving, giving, giving 
And we're receiving - 
No, no, we're taking 
Keeping the population down 
Your taxes paid, but 
Police waylaid 
And we knows 
When the school bus 
Comes and goes 
We're on your street, but 
You don't see us 
Or, if you do 
You smile and say Hello 
BUT DON'T UNDERESTIMATE US 
When you are 
Giving, giving, giving 
And we're receiving - 
No, no, we're taking 
Just keeping 
The population down 
You're giving, giving, giving 
Well, it's your own fault 
For reproducing 
We're just keeping 
The population down

 

TROUBLE LOVES ME

Trouble loves me 
Trouble needs me 
Two things 
More than you do 
Or would attempt to 
So, console me 
Otherwise, hold me 
Just when it seems like 
Everything's evened out 
And the balance 
Seems serene 
Trouble loves me 
Walks beside me 
To chide me 
Not to guide me 
It's still much more 
Than you'll do 
So, console me 
Otherwise, hold me 
Just when it seems like 
Everything's evened out 
And the balance seems serene 
See the fool I'll be 
Still running 'round 
On the flesh rampage 
Still running 'round 
Ready with ready-wit 
Still running 'round 
On the flesh rampage 
- At your age ! 
Go to Soho, oh 
Go to waste in 
The wrong arms 
Still running 'round 
Trouble loves me 
Seeks and finds me 
To charlatanize me 
Which is only 
As it should be 
Oh, please fulfill me 
Otherwise, kill me 
Show me a barrel and watch me scrape it 
Faced with the music, as always I'll face it 
In the half-light 
So English, frowning 
Then at midnight I 
Can't get you out of my head 
A disenchanted taste 
Still running 'round 
A disenchanted taste 
Still running 'round

 

PAPA JACK

Papa Jack 
Wants to turn 
Back the clock 
And reach out 
To the kids 
He once had 
Who have flown 
Papa Jack 
In decline 
Feels inclined 
To reach out 
To the kids 
He once had 
Who have flown 
But there was a time 
When the kids reached up 
And Papa Jack just 
Pushed them away 
Looking deep 
In his heart 
Papa Jack 
Doesn't like 
What he sees 
Or the time 
On his hands 
The dying day 
The chilly sun 
Papa Jack 
All alone 
Sings slow 
Grieving and low 
But there was a time 
When the kids reached up 
Now you can't always 
Have it your way 
Papa Jack 
Ah ...

 

AMMUNITION

I know these roads 
Each ridge 
And narrow bridge 
Each cheveron 
Enticing me on 
Each warning sign 
I take in my stride 
I don't need more ammunition 
I've got more than I can spend 
I don't dwell on things I'm missing 
I'm just pleased 
With the things I've found 
I know these roads 
An old hand understands 
Above all, I know what's 
Expected of me now 
Veering cliffwards 
I don't need more ammunition 
I've got more than I can spend 
I don't dwell on things I'm missing 
I'm just pleased 
With the things I've found 
With the things I've found 
With the things I've found 
I've found 
I've been crying 
It comes back on these salient days 
And it stays 
And it says : 
"We've never really been away" 
I don't need more ammunition 
I've got more than I can spend 
I don't think of who I'm missing 
I've got no space and no time 
In my life, anymore 
No space or time 
In my life, anymore 
For Revenge

 

WIDE TO RECEIVE

Download something 
Useful, or useless 
Because I'm lying here 
Wide to receive 
Almost anything 
You'd care to give 
And I don't 
Get along with myself 
And I'm not too keen 
On anyone else 
Turn on, plug in 
Then just walk away 
Unlock, process 
And then just go 
And I've never felt quite so alone 
As I do right now 
I'm lying here 
Wide to receive 
Almost anything 
You'd care to leave 
Wide, wide, wide Wide, wide, wide...

 

ROY'S KEEN

(GO ON !)
He's romancing you 
And chancing his arm 
He'll be here 
Smiling on time 
He's romancing you 
And chancing his arm 
He'll be here 
Smiling on time 
Roy's keen oh Roy's keen 
Roy's keen oh Roy's keen 
We've never seen a 
Keener window-cleaner 
Back up the ladder 
Into each corner 
Dunking the chamois 
Just think of the goodwill 
The ladder's a planet 
Roy is a star, and 
I am a satellite 
(But that's alright) 
He can hold a smile for as long 
As you require (even longer) 
He can hold a smile for as long 
As you require (even longer) 
Roy's keen oh Roy's keen 
Roy's keen oh Roy's keen 
We've never seen a 
Keener window-cleaner 
Back up the ladder 
Into each corner 
Dunking the chamois 
Just think of the goodwill 
The ladder's a planet 
Roy is a star, and 
I am a satellite 
I will be set alight 
Don't say you'll hold it steady 
Then you let it go 
Don't say you'll hold it steady 
Then you let it go Oh ...
You're up the ladder 
Into each corner 
Foot in a bucket 
We trust you to wreck it 
Even when it's under your nose 
Well, you just can't 
See it, can you ? 
Well, it's here 
Right under your nose 
And you just can't 
See it, can you? La la la la ...
Roy's keen, Roy's keen La la la la ...
We've never seen a 
Keener window-cleaner 
Oh ... La la la la ...

 

HE CRIED

I need you 
Simple words 
But words which had never been heard 
By the soul 
Stoned to death 
But still living 
And so he froze where he stood 
And he looked to the ground 
And he cried 
He cried 
Ride our minds 
If you must 
But there's always a line you don't cross 
Time is short 
Don't be cruel 
Oh you don't know the power 
In what you're saying 
Oh ... 
And so he froze where he stood 
And he looked to the ground 
And he cried 
He cried 
People where 
I come from 
They survive without feelings or blood 
I never could 
Was stoned to death 
But I'm still living 
So he froze where he stood 
And he looked to the ground 
And he cried 
He cried 
So he froze 
And he looked, and he looked 
To the ground 
And he cried 
He cried

 

SORROW WILL COME IN THE END

Legalized theft 
Leaves me bereft 
I get it straight in the neck 
(Somehow expecting no less) 
A court of justice 
With no use for Truth 
Lawyer ...liar 
Lawyer ...liar 
You pleaded and squealed 
And you think you've won 
But Sorrow will come 
To you in the end 
And as sure as my words are pure 
I praise the day that brings you pain 
Q.C.'s obsessed with sleaze 
Frantic for Fame 
They're all on the game 
They just use a different name 
You lied 
And you were believed 
By a J.P. senile and vile 
You pleaded and squealed 
And you think you've won 
But Sorrow will come 
To you in the end 
And as sure as my words are pure 
I praise the day that brings you pain 
So don't close your eyes 
Don't close your eyes 
A man who slits throats 
Has time on his hands 
And I'm gonna get you 
So don't close your eyes 
Don't ever close your eyes 
You think you've won 
OH NO

 

SATAN REJECTED MY SOUL

Satan rejected my soul 
He knows my kind 
He won't be dragged down 
He's seen my face around 
He knows Heaven doesn't seem 
To be my home 
So I must find 
Somewhere else to go 
So I must find 
Somewhere else to go 
So, take it - please 
It's free 
You'll never see 
You'll never see 
All the fun in life it's cost me 
Satan rejected my soul 
As low as he goes 
He never quite goes this low 
He's seen my face around 
He knows Heaven doesn't seem 
To be my home 
So I must find 
Somewhere else to go 
So I must find 
Somewhere else to go 
So, take it please 
It's really sly 
Come on, come on, ah Come on, come on, come on 
Take it please, It's really sly 
Come on, come on, ah Come on, come on, come on 
Call me in, Pull me in, call me in 
Come on, come on, oh Come on, come on, come on 
Pull me in, pull me in, Call me in, haul me in, pull me in 
Come on, come on, ah, Come on, come on 
La la la la la, Oh ...

 
 REEL AROUND THE FOUNTAIN

It's time the tale was told
of how you took a child
and you made him old
Reel around the fountain
slap me on the patio
I'll take it now
Fifteen minutes with you
well, I wouldn't say no
people said that you were virtually dead
and they were so wrong
fifteen minutes with you
well, i wouldn't say no
people said that you were easily led
and they were half-right
I dreamt about you last night
and i fell out of bed twice
you can pin and mount me like a butterfly
but take me to the haven of your bed
was something that you never said
two lumps, please
you're the bee's knees
but so am I
Meet me at the fountain
shove me on the patio
I'll take it slowly
Fifteen minutes with you
oh I wouldn't say no
people see no worth in you
oh but I do

 

YOU'VE GOT EVERYTHING NOW

As merry as the days were long
I was right and you were wrong
back at the old grey school
I would win and you would lose
But you've got everything now
and what a terrible mess I've made of my life
No, I've never had a job
because I've never wanted one
I've seen you smile
but I've never really heard you laugh
So who is rich and who is poor?
I cannot say...
You are your mother's only son
and you're a desperate one
But I don't want a lover
I just want to be seen in the back of your car
A friendship sadly lost?
Well, this is true ...and yet, it's false
Did I ever tell you , by the way
I never did like your face
But you've got everything now
and what a terrible mess I've made of my life
No, I've never had a job
because I'm too shy
But I don't want a lover
I just want to be tied to the back of your car.

 

MISERABLE LIE

So, goodbye
please stay with your own kind
and I'll stay with mine
There's something against us
it's not time
So, goodbye
I know I hardly say
how much I love your casual way
but please put your tongue away
a little higher and we're well away
the dark nights are drawing in
and your humour is as black as them
I look at yours, you laugh at mine
and"love" is just a miserable lie
you have destroyed my flower like-life
not once-but twice
you have corrupt my innocent mind
not once-but twice
I know that wind-swept mystical air
it means: I'd like to see your underwear
I recognise that mystical air
it means: I'd like to see your underwear
what do we get for the trouble and pain?
just a rented room in Whalley Range
into the depths of the criminal world
I followed her...
I need advice, I need advice
because nobody ever looks at me twice
I'm just a country-mile behind
the world
I'm just a country mile behind
the whole world
so take me when you go

 

PRETTY GIRLS MAKE GRAVES

Upon the sand,upon the bay
"there is a quick and easy way" you say
before you illustrate
I'd rather state:
"I'm not the man you think I am
I'm not the man you think I am "
And Sorrow's native son
he will not smile for anyone
And pretty girls makes the graves
End of the pier, end of the bay
you tug my arm and say:"Give into lust,
give up to lust, oh heaven knows we'll
soon be dust..."
But I'm not the man you think I am
I'm not the man you think I am
And Sorrow's native son
he will not rise for anyone
And pretty girls make graves
I could have been wild and I could have been free
but Nature played this trick on me
She wants it Now
and she will not wait
but she's too rough
and I'm too delicate
Then on the sand
another man, he takes her hand
and a smile lights up her stupid face
(and well, it would)
I lost my faith in Womanhood
I lost my faith in Womanhood, I lost my faith

 

THE HAND THAT ROCKS THE CRADLE

Please don't cry
the ghost and the storm outside
will not invade this sacred shire
nor infiltrate your mind
my life down I shall lie
if the bogey-man should try
to play tricks on your sacred mind
to tease, torment and tantalise
wavering shadows loom
a piano plays in an empty room
there'll be blood on the cleaver tonight
when darkness lifts and the room is bright
I'll still be by your side
for you are all that matters
and I'll love you till the day I die
there never need to be longing in your eyes
as long as the hand that rocks the cradle is mine
ceiling shadows shimmy by
and when the wardrobe towers like a beast of prey
there's a sadness in your beautiful eyes
you're untouched, unsoiled, wonderous eyes
my life down I shall lie
should restless spirts try
to play tricks on you sacred mind
but whom I never gave a name
I just looked into his wonderous eyes
and said" never never never again"
all too soon I did return
just like a moth to a flame
so rattle my bones all over the stones
because I'm only a beggar-man whom nobody owns
see how words as old as sin
fit me like a glove I'm here and here I'll stay
together we lie, together we pray
there never need be longing in your eyes
as long as the hand that rocks the cradle is mine

 

STILL ILL

I decree today that life
is simply taking and not giving
England is mine and it owes me a living
ask me why, and I'll spit in your eye
ask me why, and I'll spit in your eye
but we cannot cling to the old dreams anymore
no, we cannot cling to the old dreams anymore
Does the body rule the mind
or does the mind rule the body?
I dunno...
Under the iron bridge we kissed
and although I ended up with sore lips
it just wasn't like the old days anymore
no, it wasn't like those days
am I still ill?
Does the body rule the mind
or does the mind rule the body ?
I dunno...
Ask me why, and I'll die
ask me why, and I'll die
and if you must go to work tomorrow
well, if I were you I wouldn't bother
for there are brighter sides to life
and I should know because I've seen them
but not very often...
under the iron bridge we kissed
and although I ended up with sore lips
it just wasn't like the old days anymore
no, it wasn't like those days
am I still ill?

 

HAND IN GLOVE

Hand in glove
the sun shines out of our behinds
no, it's not like any other love
this one is different-because it's us
Hand in glove
we can go wherever we please
and everything depends upon
how near you stand to me
And if the people stare
then the people stare
I really don't know and I really don't care
Hand in glove
the Good People laugh
yes, we may be hidden by rags
but we have something they'll never have
So, hand in glove I stake my claim
I'll fight to the last breath
If they dare touch a hair on your head
I'll fight to the last breath
The Good Life is out there, somewhere
so stay on my arm, you little charmer
But I know my luck too well
and I'll probably never see you again.

 

WHAT DIFFERENCE DOES IT MAKE?

All men have secrets and here is mine
so let it be known
we have been through hell and high tide,
I can surely rely on you?
and yet you start to recoil,
heavy words are so lightly thrown
but still I'd leap in front of a flying bullet for you
So, what difference does it make?
so, what difference does it make?
it makes none
but you have gone
and you must be looking very old tonight
The devil will find work for idle hands to do
I stole and I lied, and why?
because you asked me to!
but now you make feel so ashamed
because I've only got two hands
well, I'm still fond of you
So, what difference does it make?
so, what difference does it make?
it makes none
but you have gone
and your prejudice won't keep you warm tonight
So, no more apologies
no more apologies
I'm too tired
I'm too sick and tired
and I'm feeling very sick and ill today
But I'm still fond of you

 

I DON'T OWE YOU ANYTHING

Bought on stolen wine
a nod was the first step
you know very well
what was coming next
did I really walk all this way
just to hear you say
"oh I don't want to go out tonight"
but you will
for you must
I don't owe you anything
but you owe me something
repay me now
you should never go to them
let them come to you
just like I do
you should not go to them
let them come to you
just like I do
Too freely on your lips
words prematurely said
oh but I know what will make you smile tonight
Life is never kind
life is never kind
oh but I know what will make you smile tonight

 

SUFFER LITTLE CHILDREN

Over the moors,take me to the moors
dig a shallow grave
and I'll lay me down
Lesley-Anne, with your pretty white beads
oh John, you'll never be a man
and you'll never see your home again
oh Manchester, so much to answer for
Edward, see those alluring lights?
tonight will be your very last night
a woman said "I know my son is dead
I'll never rest my hands on his scared head"
Hindley wakes and Hindley says:
"Wherever he has gone, I have gone "
But fresh lilaced moorland fields
cannot hide the stoild stench of death
Hindley wakes and Hindley says:
"Whatever he has done, I have done"
But this is no easy ride
for a child cries
"find me...find me, nothing more
we're on a sullen misty moor
we may be dead and we may be gone
but we will be right by your side
until the day you die
this is no easy ride
we will haunt you when you laugh
yes, you could say we're a team
you might sleep
BUT YOU WILL NEVER DREAM!"
Oh Manchester, so much to answer for
Oh Manchester, so much to answer for
Over the moor, I'm on the moor
the child is on the moor

RUSHOLME RUFFIANS

The last night at the fair
by the big wheel generator
a boy is stabbed
and his money is grabbed
and the air hangs heavy like a dulling wine
she is famous
she is funny
an engagement ring
doesn't mean a thing
to a mind consumed by brass(money)
and though I walk home alone
my faith in love is still devout
the last night at the fair
from a seat on a whirling waltzer
her skirt ascends for a watching eye
it's a hideous trait( on her mother's side)
and though I walk home alone
my faith in love is still devout
then someone falls in love
and someone's beaten up
and the senses being dulled are mine

is all a tremulous heart requires
a schoolgirl is denied
she said "How quickly would I die
if I jumped from the top of the parachutes?"

I WANT THE ONE I CAN'T HAVE

On the day that your mentality
catches up with your biology
I want the one I can't have
and it's driving me mad
it's written all over my face
A double-bed
and a stalwart lover, for sure
these are the riches of the poor
A double-bed
and a stalwart lover, for sure
these are the riches of the poor
a tough kid who sometimes swallows nails
raised on Prisoner's Aid
he killed a policeman when he was thirteen
and somehow that really impressed me
it's written all over my face
On the day that your mentality
catches up with your biology
And if you ever need self-validation
just meet me in the alley by the
railway-station
it's written all over my face

 

WHAT SHE SAID

What she said:
"How come someone hasn't noticed
that I'm dead
and decided to bury me
God knows, I'm ready"
What she said was
but then, all the rejection she's had
to pretend to be happy
could only be idiocy
What she said was not for the job or
lover that she never had
What she read
all heady books
she'd sit and prophesise
(it took a tattoed boy from Birkenhead
to really really open her eyes)

THAT JOKE ISN'T FUNNY ANYMORE

Park the car at the side of the road
you should know
time's tide will smother you
and I will too
when you laugh about other people who feel so
very lonely
their only desire is to die
well I'm afraid
it doesn't make me smile
I wish I could laugh
but that joke isn't funny anymore
it's too close to home and it's too near the bone
it's too close to home and it's too near the bone
more than you'll ever know
It was dark as I drove the point home
and on cold leather seats
well, it suddenly struck me
I just might die with a smile on my
face after all
I've seen this happen in other people's lives
and now it's happening in mine

 

NOWHERE FAST

I'd like to drop my trousers to the world
I am a man of means(of slender means)
each household appliance
is like a new science in my town
and if a day came when I felt a natural emotion
I'd get such a shock I'd probably jump in the ocean
and when a train goes by
it's such a sad sound
I'd like to drop my trousers to the Queen
every sensible child will know what this means
the poor and the needy
are selfish and greedy on her terms
and if the day came when I felt a natural emotion
I'd get such a shock I'd probably jump in the ocean
and when a train goes by
it's such a sad song
And when I'm lying in my bed
I think about life
and I think about death
and neither one particularly appeals to me
and if the day came when I felt a natural emotion
I'd get such a shock I'd probably lie
in the middle of the street and die
I'd lie down and die

 

WELL I WONDER

Well I wonder
do you hear me when you sleep?
I hoarsely cry
Well I wonder
do you see me when we pass?
I half-die
Please keep me in mind
please keep me in mind
Gasping-but somehow still alive
this is the fierce last stand of all I am
Gasping-dying-but somehow still alive
this is the final stand of all I am
Please keep me in mind

 

BARBARISM BEGINS AT HOME

Unruly boys
who will not grow up
must be taken in hand
Unruly girls
who will not settle down
they must be taken in hand
A crack on the head
is what you get for not asking
and a crack on the head
is what you get for asking

 

MEAT IS MURDER

Heifer whines could be human cries
closer comes the screaming knife
this beautiful creature must die
this beautiful creature must die
a death for no reason
and death for reason is MURDER
and the flesh you so fancifully fry
is not succulent, tasty or nice
it's death for no reason
and death for no reason is MURDER
and the calf that you carve with a smile
is MURDER
and the turkey you festively slice
is MURDER
do you know how animals die?
kitchen aroma aren't very homely
it's not "comforting," "cheery" or kind
it's sizzling blood and the unholy stench
of MURDER
it's not "natural," "normal" or kind
the fleas you so fancifully fry
as you savour the flavour
of MURDER
NO, NO, NO, IT'S MURDER
NO, NO, NO, IT'S MURDER
who hears when animals cry?

 

THE QUEEN IS DEAD

Farewell to this lands cheerless marches
hemmed in like a boar between arches
her very Lowness with her head in a sling
Im truely sorry-but it sounds like a wonderful thing
dear Charles, dont you ever crave
to appear on the front of the Daily mail
dressed in your Mother's bridal veil?
So, I checked all the registered historical facts
and I was shocked into shame to discover
how Im the 18th pale descendent
of some, old queen or other
has the world changed, or have I changed?
has the world changed, or have I changed?
as some 9-year old tough peddles drugs
(I never even knew what drugs were)
And so, I broke into the Palace
with a sponge and a rusty spanner
she said: "Eh, I know you, and you cannot sing"
I said: "that's nothing -you should hear me play piano"
We can go for a walk where it's quiet and dry
and we can talk about precious things
but when you are tied to your mother's apron
not one talks about castration
We can go for a walk where it's quiet and dry
and we can talk about precious things
like love and law and poverty
these are the things that kill me
We can go for a walk where it's quiet and dry
and we can talk about precious things
but the rain that flattens my hair
theses are the things that kill me
Passed the Pub that saps your body
and the church who'll snatch your money
the Queen is dead, boys
and it's so lonely on a limb
Pass the Pub that wrecks your body
and the church-all they want is your money
the Queen is dead, boys`
you can trust me, boys
life is very long, when you're lonely
life is very long, when you're lonely...

 

FRANKLY MR.SHANKLY

Frankly, Mr Shankly, this position Ive held
it pays my way, but it corrodes my soul
I want to leave you will not miss me
I want to go down in musical history
Frankly, Mr Shankly, Im a sickening wreck
Ive got the 21st Century breathing down my neck
I must move fast, you understand me
I want to go down in celluloid history
Fame, Fame, fatal Fame
it can play hideous tricks on the brain
but still I rather be Famous
than righteous or holy, any day
but sometimes Id feel more fulfilled
making Christmas cards with the mentally ill
I want to Live and I want to Love
I want to catch something that I might be ashamed of
Frankly, Mr Shankly, this position I've held
it pays my way and it corrodes my soul
oh, I didnt realise that you wrote poetry
(I didnt realise you wrote such bloody awful poetry)
Frankly, Mr Shankly, since you ask
you are a flatulent pain the arse
I do not mean to be so rude
but still, I must speck frankly, Mr Shankly

 

I KNOW IT'S ALL OVER

Oh Mother, I can fell the soil falling over my head
and as i climb into an empty bed
Oh well, Enough said
I know it's over-still I cling
I don't know where else I can go
Oh Mother, I can feel the soil falling over my head
see, the sea want s to take me
the knife wants to cut me
do you think you can help me?
Sad veiled bride, please be happy
handsome groom, give her room
loud, loutish lover, treat her kindly
(although she needs you
more than she loves you)
and I know it's over
and it never really began
but in my heart it was so real
and you even spoke to me and said:
"If you're so funny
then why are you on your own tonight?
and if you are so clever
then why are you on your own tonight?
if you're so terribly good looking
then why do you sleep alone tonight?
because tonight is just like any other night
that's why you're on your own tonight
with your triumphs and your charms
while they are in each other's arms.."
It's so easy to laugh
it's so easy to hate
it takes strength to be gentle and kind
It's so easy to laugh
it's so easy to hate
it takes guts to be gentle and kind
love is Natural and Real
but not for you, my love
not tonight my love
love is Natural and Real
but not for such as you and I, my love
Oh Mother, I can fell the soil falling over my head
Oh Mother, I can fell the soil falling over my head...

 

NEVER HAD NO ONE EVER

When you walk without ease
on these
the very streets where you were raised
I had a really bad dream
it lasted 20 years, 7 months, and 27 days
Never had no one ever.

 

CEMETERY GATES

A dreaded sunny day
so I meet you at the cemetry gates
Keats and Yeats are on your side
A dreaded sunny day
so I meet you at the cemetry gates
Keats and Yeats are on your side
while Wilde is on mine
So we go inside and we gravely read the stones
all those people all those lives
where are they now ?
with loves, and hates
and passions just like mine
they were born
and then they lived and then they died
which seems so unfair
and I wantr to crv
You say: "ere thrice the sun hath done salutation to the dawn"
and you claim these words as your own
but Im well-read, have heard them said
a hundred times (maybe less, maybe more)
if you must write prose/poems
the words you use should be your own
dont plagiarise or take "on loans"
there's alweays someone, somewhere
with a big nose, who knows
and who trips you up and laughs
when you fall
You say: "ere long done do does did "
words which could only be your own
you then produce the text
from whence was ripped
(some dizzy whore, 1804)
A dreaded sunny day
so let's go where we're happy
so I meet you at the cemetry gates
Keats and Yeats are on your side
A dreaded sunny day
so let's go where we're wanted
so I meet you at the cemetry gates
Keats and Yeats are on your side
but you lose
because Wilde is on mine

 

BIGMOUTH STRIKES AGAIN

Sweetness, sweetness I was only joking
when I said Id like to smash every tooth
in your head
Sweetness, sweetness I was only joking
when I said by right s you should be
bludgeoned in your bed
and now I know how Joan of Arc felt
now I know how Joan of Arc felt
as the flames roseto her roman nose
and her Walkman stared to melt
Bibmouth, bigmouth
bigmouth strikes again
and Ive got no right to take my place
with the Human race
and now I know how Joan of Arc felt
now I know of Joan of Arc felt
as the flames rose to her roman nose
and her hearing aid started to melt
Bigmouth, bigmouth
bigmouth strikes again

THE BOY WITH A THORN IN HIS SIDE

The boy with the thorn in his side
behind the hatred there lies
a murderous desire for love
how can they look into my eyes
and still they dont believe me
how can they hear me say those words
and still they dont believe me
and if they don't believe me now
will they ever believe me?
and if they don't believe me now
will they ever believe me?
The boy with the thorn in his side
behind the hatred there lies
a plundering desire for love
how can they see the Love in our eyes
and still they don't believe us
and after all this time
they don't want to believe us
and if they dont believe us now
will they ever believe us ?
andd when you want to Live
how do you start ?
where do you go ?
who do you know?

 

VICAR IN A TUTU

I was minding mind business
lifting some lead off
the roof of the Holy Name church
it was worthwhile living a laughable life
just to set my eyes on a blistering sight
of a vicar in a tu-tu
he's not strange
he just wants to live his life this way
a scanty bit of a thing
with a decorative ring
that wouldn't cover the head of a child
as Rose collects the money in the cannister
who comes sliding down the bannister
the vicar in a tu-tu
he's not strange
he just wants to live his life this way
the monkish monsignor
with a head full of plaster
said "my man, get your vile soul dry-cleaned"
as Rose counts the money in the cannister
as natural as rain
he dances again
vicar in a tu-tu
The next day in the pulpit
with Freedom and Ease
combating ignoranca,dust and disease
as Rose counts the money in the cannister
as natural as rain
he dances again
the fabric of a tu-tu
any man could get us to
and I am a living sign.

 

THERE IS A LIGHT THAT NEVER GOES OUT

Take me out tonight
where there's music and there's people
who are young and alive
driving in your car
I never never want to go home
because I havent got one
anymore
take me out tonight
because I want to see people and I
want to see lights
driving in your car
oh please dont drop me home
because it's not my home, it's their
home, and Im welcome no morw
and if a double-decker bus
crashes in to us
to die by your side
such a heavenly way to die
and if a ten ton truck
kills the both of us
to die by your side
the pleasure and the privilege is mine
take me out tonight
oh take me anywhere, I dont care
and in the darken underpass
I thought Oh God, my chance has come at last
(but then a strange fear gripped me and I just couldn't ask)
take me out tonight
take me anywhere, I dont care
just driving in your car
I never never want to go home
because I havent got one
I havent got one.

 

SOME GIRLS ARE BIGGER THAN OTHERS

From the ice-age to the dole-age
there is but one concern
and I have just discover
some girls are bigger than others
some girls are bigger than others
some girls mothers are bigger than
other girls mothers
As Anthony said to Cleopatra
as he opened a crate of ale:
some girls are bigger than others
some girls are bigger than others
some girls mothers are bigger than
other girls mothers.

 

A RUSH AND A PUSH AND AND THE LAND IS OURS

HELLO
I am the ghost of Troubled Joe
hung by his pretty white neck
some eighteen months ago
I travelled to a mystical time zone
but I missed my bed
so I soon came home
they said:
"there's too much caffeine
in your bloodstream
and a lack of real spice
in your life"
I said:
"leave me alone
because I'm alright, dad
just surprised to still
be on my own...."
Ooh, but don't mention love
I'd hate the real strain of the pain again
a rush and a push and the land that
we stand on is ours
it has been before
so it shall be again
and people who are uglier than you and I
they take what they need, and leave
Ooh, but don't mention love
I'd hate the pain and the strain all over again
a rush and a push and the land that
we stand on is ours
it has been before
so why can't it be now?
and people who are weaker than you and I
they take what they want from life
Ooh, but don't mention love
no - just don't mention love!
a rush and a push and the land that
we stand on is ours
your youth may be gone
but you're still a young man
so phone me, phone me, phone me
so phone me, phone me, phone me
Ooh, I think I'm in love...
Urrgh, I think I'm in lerv

 

I STARTED SOMETHING I COULDN'T FINISH

The lanes were silent
with nothing or no one around for miles
I doused our friendly venture
with a hard-faced
three-word gesture
I started something
I forced you into a zone
and you were clearly
never meant to go
hair brushed and parted
typical me, typical me, typical me
I started something
...and now I'm not too sure
I grabbed you by the guilded beams
that's what Tradition means
and I doused another venture
with a gesture
that was...absolutely vile
I started something
forced you to a zone
and you were clearly
never meant to go
hair brushed and parted
typical me, typical me, typical me
I started something
...and now I'm not too sure
I grabbed you by the guilded beams
that's what Tradition means
and now eighteen months' hard-labour
seems...fair enough
I started something
forced you to a zone
and you were clearly
never meant to go
hair brushed and parted
typical me, typical me, typical me

DEATH OF A DISCO DANCER

The death of a disco dancer
well, it happens a lot 'round here
and if you think Peace
is a common goal
well, that goes to show
just how little you know
The death of a disco dancer
well, I'd rather not get involved
I never talk to my neighbour
I'd just rather not get involved
Love, peace and harmony?
Love, peace and harmony?
Oh, very nice, very nice, very nice, very nice
...but maybe in the next world.

 

GIRLFRIEND IN A COMA

Girlfriend in a coma, I know
I know - it's serious
Girlfriend in a coma, I know
I know - it's really serious
there wree times when I could
have 'murdered' her
(but, you know, I would hate
anything to happen to her)
NO, I DON'T WANT TO SEE HER
Do you really think
she'll pull through?
Do you really think
she'll pull through?
Girlfriend in a coma, I know
I know, it's serious
there were time when I could
have 'strangeled' her
(but, you know, I would hate
anything to happen to her)
WOULD YOU PLEASE LET ME SEE HER!
Do you really think she'll pull through?
Do you really think she'll pull through?
Let me wisper my last goodbyes
I know - IT'S SERIOUS

 

STOP ME IF YOU'VE HEARD THIS ONE BEFORE

Stop me, stop me,
stop me if you think that you've heard this one before
stop me, stop me
stop me if you think that you've heard this one before
nothing's changed
I still love you, oh I still love you
...only slightly less than I used to
I was delayed, I was way-laid
an emergency stop
I smelt the last ten seconds of life
I crashed down on the crossbar
and the pain was enough to make
a shy, bald buddhist reflect
and plan a mass-murder
who said I'd lied to her?
who said I'd lied because I never
who said I'd lied because I never
I was detained, I was restrained
he broke my spleen
he broke my knees
(and then he really laid into me)
Friday night in Out-patients
who said I'd lied to her?
who said I'd lied - because I never
who said I'd lied - because I never
Oh, so I drank one
or was it four
and when I fell on the floor
...I drank more
stop me, stop me
stop me if you think that you've heard this one before
nothing's changed
I still love you, I still love you
but only slightly
less than I used to

 

LAST NIGHT I DREAMT THAT SOMEBODY LOVED ME

Last night I dreamt
that somebody loved me
no hope - but no harm
just another false alarm
Las night I felt
real arms around me
no hope - no harm
just another false alarm
so, tell me how long
before the last one?
and tell me how long
before the right one?
this story is old - I KNOW
but it goes on
this story is old - I KNOW
but it goes on

 

UNHAPPY BIRTHDAY

I've come to wish you an unhappy birthday
I've come to wish you an unhappy birthday
because you're evil
and you lie
and if you should die
I may feel slightly sad
(but I won't cry)
Loved and lost
and some may say
when usually its Nothing
surely you're happy
it should be this way?
I say "No, I'm gonna kill my dog"
and: "May the lines sag heavy
and deep tonight XXX"
I've come to wish you an unhappy birthday

from the one you left behind

PAINT A VULGAR PICTURE

At the record company meeting
On their hands - a dead star
and ooh, the plans that they weave
and ooh, the sikening greed
At the record company meeting
on their hands - a dead star
the sycophantic slags all say:
"I knew him first, and I knew him well"
Re-issue! Re-package! Re-package!
Re-evaluate the songs
double-pack with a photograph
Extra Track (and a tacky badge)
A-list, playlist
"Please them, please them!"
"Please them! Please them!"
(sadly, THIS was your life)
but you could have said no
if you'd wanted to
you could have said no
if you'd wanted to
BPI, MTV, BBC
"Please them! Please them!"
(sadly this was your life)
but you could have said no
if you'd wanted to
you could have walked away
...couldn't you?
I touched you at the soundcheck
you had no real way of knowing
in my heart I bgged "please, take
me with you...
I don't care where you're going"
But to you I was faceless
I was fawning, I was boring
just a child from those ugly new houses
who could never begin to know
who could never really know
Best of? Most of?
Satiate the need
slip them into different sleeves!
Buy both, and be decieved
climber - new entry, re-entry
World tour! ("media whore")
"Please the Press in Belgium!"
(THIS was your life...)
and when it fails to recoup?
Well, maybe:
You just haven't earned it yet, baby
I walked a pace behind you at the soundcheck
you're just the same as I am
what makes most people feel happy
leads us headlong into harm
so, in my bedroom in those 'ugly new houses'
I dance my legs down to the knees
but me and my 'true love'
we will never meet again...
At the record company meeting
on their hands - at last! - a dead star!
but they cannot taint you in my eyes
no, they cannout touch you now
No, they cannot hurt you my darling
they cannot touch you now
but me and my 'true love'
will never meet again

 

DEATH AT ONE'S ELBOW

Ooh Glenn, don't come to the house tonight
Ooh, Glenn, don't come to the house tonight
because there's somebody here
who really really loves you
stay home
be bored
(it's crap, I KNOW)
Ooh, Glenn, don't come to the house tonight
Ooh, Glen, don't come to the house tonight
because there's somebody here
who'll take a hatchet to your ear
how the frustration renders me
hateful, Glenn!
don't come to the house tonight
don't come to the house tonight
because you'll slip on the
trail of my bespattered remains
and so, that's why
GOODBYE MY LOVE, GOODBYE MY LOVE, GOODBYE MY LOVE...
Belch

 

I WON'T SHARE YOU

I won't share you
I won't share you
with the drive and ambition
and the zeal I feel
this is my time
as the note I wrote
was read, she said
has the Perrier gone
straight to my head
or is life plainly sick and cruel, instead?
"YES!"
No-no-no-no-no-no
I won't share you
I won't share you
with the drive and the dreams inside
this is my time
Life tends to come and go
well, that's OK
just as long as you know
Life tends to come and go
well, that's OK
just as long as you know
I won't share you
I won't share you

this is my time, this is my time

PANIC

Panic on the streets of London
Panic on the streets of Birmingham
I wonder to myself
Could life ever be sane again
on the Leeds side-streets that you slip down
I wonder to myself
Hopes may rise on the Grasmeres
But Honey Pie, you're not safe here
So you run down
To the safety of the town
But there's Panic on the streets of Carlisle
Dublin, Dundee, Humberside
I wonder to myself
Burn down the Disco
Hang the blessed D.J.
Because the music that they constantly play
IT SAYS NOTHING TO ME ABOUT MY LIFE
Hang the blessed D.J.
Because the music they constantly play
On the Leeds side-streets that you slip down
On the provincial towns that you jog 'round
Hang the D.J.,. Hang the D.J.,.Hang the D.J...

ASK

Shyness is nice, but
Shyness can stop you
From doing all the things in life
That you'd like to
So, if there's something you'd like to try
ASK ME-I WON'T SAY "NO"-HOW COULD I?
Coyness is nice, but ,
Coyness can stop you
from saying all the things in
life that you want to
If there's something that you'd like to try
ASK ME-I WON'TSAY"NO"-HOW COULD I?
Spending warm, Summer days indoors
Writing fringhtening verse
To a buck-toothed girl in Luxembourg
ASK ME, ASK ME ,ASK ME, ASK ME, ASK ME ,ASK ME
Because if it's not Love
Then it's the Bomb
That will bring us together
Nature is a language-can't you read?
Nature is a language-can't you read?
ASK ME, ASK ME ,ASK ME, ASK ME, ASK ME ,ASK ME
Because if it's not Love
Then it's the Bomb
That will bring us together

 

MARIE'S THE NAME (HIS LATEST FLAME) / RUSHOLME RUFFIANS

Very old friend 
Came by today 
As he was telling everyone in town 
Of all the love that he'd just found 
And Marie's the name (of his latest flame) 
Talked and talked 
And I heard him say 
That she had the longest blackest hair 
Prettiest green eyes anywhere 
And Marie's the name (of his latest flame) 
The last night of the fair 
By the big wheel generator 
A boy is stabbed 
His money is grabbed 
And the air hangs heavy like a dulling wine 
She is Famous 
She is Funny 
An engagement ring 
Doesn't mean a thing 
To a mind consumed by brass (money), oh 
The last night of the fair 
From a seat on a whirling waltzer 
Her skirt ascends for a watching eye 
It's a hideous trait (on her mother's side)
From a seat on a whirling waltzer 
Her skirt ascends for a watching eye 
A hideous trait (on her mother's side) 
Then someone falls in love 
Someone's beaten up 
Someone's beaten up 
And the senses being dulled are mine 
And someone falls in love 
Someone's beaten up 
And the senses being dulled are mine 
This is the last night of the fair 
And the grease in the hair 
Of a speedway operator 
Is all a tremulous heart requires 
A schoolgirl is denied 
She said : "How quickly would I die 
If I jumped from the top of the parachutes ?"
This is the last night of the fair 
And the grease in the hair 
Of a speedway operator 
Is all a tremulous heart requires 
A schoolgirl is denied 
She said : "How quickly would I die 
Oh, if I jumped from the top of the parachutes ?"
...Oh, walk home alone 
I might walk home alone 
But my faith in love is still devout

 

THE BOY WITH THE THORN IN HIS SIDE

The boy with the thorn in his side
behind the hatred there lies
a murderous desire for love
how can they look into my eyes
and still they dont believe me
how can they hear me say those words
and still they dont believe me
and if they don't believe me now
will they ever believe me?
and if they don't believe me now
will they ever believe me?
The boy with the thorn in his side
behind the hatred there lies
a plundering desire for love
how can they see the Love in our eyes
and still they don't believe us
and after all this time
they don't want to believe us
and if they dont believe us now
will they ever believe us ?
andd when you want to Live
how do you start ?
where do you go ?
who do you know?

 

RUBBER RING / WHAT SHE SAID

Yeah! What she says : 
"How come someone hasn't noticed 
That I'm dead 
And decided to bury me ? 
God knows, I'm ready !"
La-la-la ... 
What she said was sad 
But then, all the rejection she's had 
To pretend to be happy 
Could only be idiocy 
La-la-la ... 
What she said was not for the job or 
Lover that she never had 
No no no ... 
What she read 
All heady books 
She'd sit and prophesise 
(It took a tattooed boy from 
Birkenhead 
To really really open her eyes)

AND I NEED TO CLING TO SOMETHING !"

IS IT REALLY SO STRANGE?

I left the North 
I travelled South 
I found a tiny house 
And I can't help the way I feel 
Oh yes, you can kick me 
And you can punch me 
And you can break my face 
But you won't change the way I feel 
'Cause I love you, Oh ... 
And is it really so strange ? 
Oh, is it really so strange ? 
Oh, is it really so, really so strange ? 
I say NO, you say YES 
(and you will change your mind) 
I left the South 
I travelled North 
I got confused - I killed a horse 
I can't help the way I feel 
Oh yes, you can punch me 
And you can butt me 
And you can break my spine 
But you won't change the way I feel 
'Cause I love you, Oh ... 
And is it really so strange ? 
Oh, is it really so strange ? 
Oh, is it really so, really so strange ? 
I say NO, you say YES 
(But you will change your mind) 
I left the North again 
I travelled South again 
And I got confused - I killed a nun 
I CAN'T HELP THE WAY I FEEL 
(I lost my bag in Newport Pagnell) 
Why is the last mile the hardest mile ? 
My throat was dry, with the sun in my eyes 
And I realised, I realised 
I could never 
I could never, never, never, go back home again

 

CEMETERY GATES

A dreaded sunny day
so I meet you at the cemetry gates
Keats and Yeats are on your side
A dreaded sunny day
so I meet you at the cemetry gates
Keats and Yeats are on your side
while Wilde is on mine
So we go inside and we gravely read the stones
all those people all those lives
where are they now ?
with loves, and hates
and passions just like mine
they were born
and then they lived and then they died
which seems so unfair
and I wantr to crv
You say: "ere thrice the sun hath done salutation to the dawn"
and you claim these words as your own
but Im well-read, have heard them said
a hundred times (maybe less, maybe more)
if you must write prose/poems
the words you use should be your own
dont plagiarise or take "on loans"
there's alweays someone, somewhere
with a big nose, who knows
and who trips you up and laughs
when you fall
You say: "ere long done do does did "
words which could only be your own
you then produce the text
from whence was ripped
(some dizzy whore, 1804)
A dreaded sunny day
so let's go where we're happy
so I meet you at the cemetry gates
Keats and Yeats are on your side
A dreaded sunny day
so let's go where we're wanted
so I meet you at the cemetry gates
Keats and Yeats are on your side
but you lose
because Wilde is on mine

 

LONDON

Smoke
Lingers 'round your fingers
Train
Heave on - to Euston
Do you think you've made
The right decision this time?
You left
Your tired family grieving
And you think they're sad because you're leaving
But didn't you see the Jealousy in the eyes
Of the ones who had to stay behind?
And do you think you've made
The right decision thins time?
You left
Your girlfriend on the platform
With thei really ragged notion that you'll return
But she knows
That when he goes
He really goes
So do you think you've made
The right decision this time?

 

I KNOW IT'S OVER

I can feel the soil falling over my head 
And as I climb into an empty bed 
Oh well. Enough said. 
I know it's over - still I cling 
I don't know where else I can go 
Over ... 
Oh Mother, I can feel the soil falling over my head 
See, the sea wants to take me 
The knife wants to cut me 
Do you think you can help me ? 
Sad veiled bride, please be happy 
Handsome groom, give her room 
Loud, loutish lover, treat her kindly 
(Though she needs you 
More than she loves you) 
And I know it's over - still I cling 
I don't know where else I can go 
Over, it's over, it's over, it's over 
It's over, la ... 
I know it's over 
And it never really began 
But in my heart it was so real
And you even spoke to me, and said : 
"If you're so funny 
Then why are you on your own tonight ? 
And if you're so clever 
Then why are you on your own tonight ? 
I know ... 
'Cause tonight - it's just like any other night 
That's why you're on your own tonight 
Your triumphs and your charms 
While they're in each other's arms..."
It's so easy to laugh 
It's so easy to hate 
It takes strength to be gentle and kind 
Over, over, over, over 
It's so easy to laugh 
It's so easy to hate 
It takes guts to be gentle and kind 
Over, over 
Love is Natural and Real 
But not for you, my love 
Not tonight, my love 
Love is Natural and Real 
But not for such as you and I, my love 
Oh Mother, I can feel the soil falling over my head...
Oh Mother, I can feel the soil fall over, fall over my head 
Oh Mother, I can feel the ... fall over my ... , Oh ...

 

THE DRAIZE TRAIN

A vastly superior version of the instrumental B-side, acting as a peace 
offering to Marr (Morrissey chose the tracks for the compilation, 
and of course, receives no royalties on this track).

 

STILL ILL

I decree today that life
is simply taking and not giving
England is mine and it owes me a living
ask me why, and I'll spit in your eye
ask me why, and I'll spit in your eye
but we cannot cling to the old dreams anymore
no, we cannot cling to the old dreams anymore
Does the body rule the mind
or does the mind rule the body?
I dunno...
Under the iron bridge we kissed
and although I ended up with sore lips
it just wasn't like the old days anymore
no, it wasn't like those days
am I still ill?
Does the body rule the mind
or does the mind rule the body ?
I dunno...
Ask me why, and I'll die
ask me why, and I'll die
and if you must go to work tomorrow
well, if I were you I wouldn't bother
for there are brighter sides to life
and I should know because I've seen them
but not very often...
under the iron bridge we kissed
and although I ended up with sore lips
it just wasn't like the old days anymore
no, it wasn't like those days
am I still ill?

 

BIGMOUTH STRIKES AGAIN

Sweetness, sweetness I was only joking
when I said Id like to smash every tooth
in your head
Sweetness, sweetness I was only joking
when I said by right s you should be
bludgeoned in your bed
and now I know how Joan of Arc felt
now I know how Joan of Arc felt
as the flames roseto her roman nose
and her Walkman stared to melt
Bibmouth, bigmouth
bigmouth strikes again
and Ive got no right to take my place
with the Human race
and now I know how Joan of Arc felt
now I know of Joan of Arc felt
as the flames rose to her roman nose
and her hearing aid started to melt
Bigmouth, bigmouth
bigmouth strikes again
and Ive got no right to take my place
with the Human race

 
ALSATIAN COUSTIN

Were you and he Lovers?
and would you say so if you were?
on a forecourt
on a Friday
passing my way
Were you and he Lovers?
and if you were, then say that you were!
on a groundsheet
under canvas
with your tent-flap
open wide
A note upon his desk:
"P.S. Bring Me Home And Have Me!"
Leather elbows on a tweed coat
- Oh! -
Is THAT the best you can do?
So came his reply:
"...but on the desk is where I want you!"
So I ask (even though I know):
were you and he Lovers?

 

LITTLE MAN, WHAT NOW?

An afternoon nostalgia
television show
you spoke in silhouette
(but they couldn't name you)
although the panel were
very polite to you
but I remembered you
from Friday nights 1969
ATV - you murdered every line
too old to be a child star
too young to take leads
four seasons passed
and they AXED you
nervously juvenile
(WON'T SMILE!)
What became of you?
did that swift eclipse torture you?
a star at eighteen
and then-suddenly gone
down to a few lines
in the back page of a teenage annual
oh but I remembered you
I looked up to you

 

EVERYDAY IS LIKE SUNDAY

Trudging slowly over wet sand
back to the bench
where your clothes were stolen
this is the coastal town
that they forgot to close down
Armageddon - come Armageddon!
Come Armageddon! Come!
Everyday is like Sunday
everyday is silent and grey
Hide on the promenade
scratch out a postcard
"how I dearly with I was not here"
in the seaside town
...that they forgot to bomb
Come! Come! Come - nuclear bomb!
Everyday is like Sunday
everyday is silent and grey
Trudging back over pebbles and sand
and a strange dust lands on your hands
(and on your face)
Everyday is like Sunday
"Win Yourself A Cheap Tray"
share some greased tea with me
everyday is silent and grey

 

BENGALI IN PLATFORMS

No no no
he does not want to depress you
oh no no no no no
he only wants to impress you
Bengali in platform
she only wants to embrace your culture
and to be your friend forever
Bengali, Bengali
oh shelve your Western plans
and understand that life is hard enough when you belong here
A silver-studded rim that glistens
and an ankle-star that...blinds me
a lemon sole so very high
which only reminds me, to tell you
so I break the news gently
I break the news to you gently
"Shelve your plans"
Bengali, Bengali
its the touchy march of time
that blinds you
don't blame me
don't hate me
just because I'm the one to tell you
that life is hard enough when you belong here
life is hard enough when you belong here
shelve your western plans
life is hard enough when you belong here

 

ANGEL, ANGEL, DOWN WE GO TOGETHER

Angel, Angel
don't take your life tonight
I know they take
and that they take in turn
and they give you nothing real
for yourself in return
and when they've used you
and they've broken you
and wasted all your money
and cast your shell aside
and when they've bought you
and they've sold you
and they've billed you for the pleasure
and they've made your parents cry
I will be here
BELIEVE ME
I will be here
...believe me
Angel, don't take your life
some people have got no pride
they do not understand
the Urgency of life
but I love you more than life
I love you more than life
I love you more than life
I love you more than life

 

LALE NIGHT, MAUDLIN STREET

The last night on Maudlin Street
goodbye house
goodbye stairs
I was born here
I was raised here, and
...I took some stick here
love at first sight
may sound trite
but it's true, you know
I could list the details
of everything you ever wore
or said, or how you stood that day
and as we spend the last night
on Maudlin Street, I say
"goodbye house-forever!"
I never stole a happy hour
around here
Where the world's ugliest boy
became what you see
here I am - the ugliest man
Its the last night on Maudlin Street
and truly I do love you
oh, truly I do love you
When I sleep with that picture of
you framed beside my bed
oh, it's childish and it's silly
but I think it's you in my room
by the bed (...yes, I told you it was silly...)
and I know
I took strange pills
but I never meant to hurt you
oh truly I love you
I came home late one night
everyone had gone to bed
nobody stays up for you
when you have sixteen stitches
all around your head
the last buss I missed to Maudlin Street
so, he drove me home in the Van
complaining: "Women only like me for my mind..."
don't leave your torch behind
power-cuts ahead
as we crept through the park
but no I cannot steal a pair of jeans
off a clothesline for you
but you...without clothes
oh I could not keep a straight face
me - without clothes?
well a nation turns its back and gags...
I'm packed
I am moving house
a half-life disappears today
every slag waves me on
(secretly wishing me gone
well, I will be soon
oh - I will be soon)
There were bad times on Maudlin Street
when they took you away in a police car
dear Inspector - don't you know?
don't you care?
don't you know - about Love?
Your gran died
and your mother died
on Maudlin Street
in pain and ashamed
with never time to say
those special things
I took the keys from Maudlin Street
well, it's only bricks and mortar!
and...truly I do love you
wherever you are
wherever you are

 

SUEDHEAD

Why do you come here
why do you hang around
I'm so sorry
I'm so sorry
Why do you come here
when you know it makes
things hard for me
when you know, oh
why do you come?
Why do you telephone?
and why send me silly notes?
I'm so sorry
I'm so sorry
why do you come here
when you know it makes
thing hard for me
when you know, oh
why do you come?
You had to sneak into my room
'just' to read my diary
was it just to see all the things
you knew I'd written about you?
and...so many illustrations
I'm so very sickened
oh, I am so sickened NOW

 

BREAK UP THE FAMILY

The strange logic of your clumsiest line
stayed emblazoned on my mind
break up the family
and lets begin to live our lives
I went to see all my friends tonight
it wasn't Youth, it wasn't even Life
born Old, sadly wise
resigned (well, we were)
to ending our lives
I'm so glad to grow older
to move away from those awful times
I want to see all my friends tonight
Yes you found love but you weren't
at peace with your life
home late, full of Hate
despise the ties that bind
oh I'm so glad to grow older
to move away from those younger years
now I'm in love for the first time
and I don't feel bad
Let me see all my old friends
let me put my arm around them
because I really do love them
now, does that sound mad?
Captain of games, solid framed
I stood on the touchline
hailstones, driven home
in his car - no breaks? I don't mind
I'm just so glad to grow older
to move away from those darker years
I'm in love for the first time
and I don't feel bad
so wish me luck my friends
goodbye

 

HAIRDRESSER ON FIRE

Here is London
here is London
is it home of the free,
or what?
can you squeeze me
into an empty page of your diary
and psychologically save me
I've got faith in you
I sense the power
in the fingers
within an hour the power
can totally destroy me
or it could same my life
here is London
'home of the brash, outrageous
and free'
you are repressed
but you're remarkably dressed
is it Real?
but you're far to busy
busy scissors
busy clippers
hair dresser on fire
all around Sloane Square
and you're far too busy
to see me
"busy,busy"
hairdresser on fire
was a client over-cautious
he made you nervous
and when he said
"I'm gonna sue you"
I really felt for you
so can you squeeze me
into an empty page of your diary
and supernaturally change me
CHANGE ME, CHANGE ME

 

THE ORDINARY BOYS

Ordinary boys, happy knowing nothing
happy being no one, but themselves
Ordinary girls, supermarket clothes
who think it's very clever to be cruel to you
for you were so different
you stood all alone
and you knew
that it had to be so
avoiding ordinary boys
happy going nowhere, just around here
in their rattling cars
and ordinary girls
never seeing further
than the cold, small streets
that trap them
but you were so different
you had to say no
when those empty fools
tried to change you, and claim you
for the lair of their ordinary world
where they feel so lucky
so lucky, so lucky
with their lives laid out before them
they're so lucky, so lucky
so lucky, so lucky

 

I DON'T MIND IF YOU FORGET ME

I don't mind
I don't mind if you forget me
having learned my lesson
I never left an impression on anyone
so now you send me your hardened 'regards'
when once you'd send me 'love'
sincerely I must tell you
your mild 'best wishes'
they make me suspicious
but I don't mind
I don't mind if you forget me
having learned my lesson
I never left
an impression on anyone
the pressure to change, to move on
was strange
and very strong
so this is why I tell you
I really do understand
BYE BYE
I don't mind if you forget me
no no no no no no no
REJECTION IS ONE THING
BUT REJECTION FROM A FOOL
IS CRUEL
REJECTION IS ONE THING
BUT REJECTION FROM A FOOL
IS CRUEL
and I don't mind if you forget me
I don't mind if your forget me

 

DIAL-A-CLICHE

Further into the fog I fall
well, I was just
following you!
when you said:
"Do as I do and scrap your fey ways"
(dial-a-cliche)
"grow up, be a man, and close your mealy-mouth!"
(dial-a-cliche)
But the person underneath
where does he go?
does he slide by the wayside?
or...does he just die?
when you find that you've organized
your feelings, for people
who didn't like you then
and certainly don't like you now
yet still you say:
"Do as I do and scrap your fey ways"
(dial-a-cliche)
"grow up, be a man, and close your mealy-mouth!"
(dial-a-cliche)
"the Safe way is the only way!
there's always time to change, son!"
yes well I've changed
but I'm in pain!
dial-a-chiche

 

MARGARET ON THE GUILLOTINE

The kind people
have a wonderful dream
Margaret on the guillotine
because people like you
make me feel so tired
when will you die?
when will you die?
when will you die?
when will you die?
when will you die?
because people like you
make me feel so old inside
please die
and kind people
do not shelter this dream
make it real
make the dream real
make the dream real
make it real

 

OUR FRANK

Our frank and open
deep conversations
they get me nowhere
they bring me down, so
give it a rest, won't you?
give me a cigarette
God give me patience
just no more conversation
Give us a drink
and make it quick
or else I'm gonna be sick
sick all over
your frankly vulgar
red pullover
now see how the colours blend
Our frank and open
deep conversations
they get me nowhere
they bring me down, so
give it a rest, won't you?
now will you just give over
the world may be ending
but look, I'm only human
Give us a drink
and make it quick
or else I'm gonna be sick
all over
your frankly vulgar
red pullover
now see how the two colours blend
Won't somebody stop me
from thinking all the time
about everything
so deeply
so bleakly

 

ASIAN RUT

Day oh so late
strangely the sun still shone
oh Asian boy
what are you on?
Day oh so late
strangely the sun still shone
what drugs are you on?
Tooled-up Asian boy
has come here to avenge
the cruel, cold killing
of his very best friend
Tooled-up Asian boy
has come here to take revenge
for the cruel, cold killing
of his only friend
Peace through the school
so quiet in the hall
it's a strange sign for one
of what's to come
Tough and hard and pale
oh they may just impale you on railings
oh English boys
it must be wrong
three against one?
Brakes slammed, and
a gun jammed, and
as far as I could tell
brave Asian boy
dealt a blow and fell
I'm just passing through here
on my way to somewhere civilised
and maybe I'll even arrive
maybe I'll even arrive?

 

SING YOUR LIFE

Sing your life
any fool can think of words that rhyme
many others do
why don't you?
do you want to?
Sing your life
just walk right up to the microphone
and name
all the things that you love
all the things that you loathe
sing your life
all the things that you love
all the things that you loathe
oh sing your life
oh sing your life
Others sang your life
but now's your chance to shine
and have the pleasure of
saying what you mean
the rare pleasure of
meaning what you sing
oh, make no mistake, my friend
all of this will end
so sing it now
all the things you love
all the things you loathe
oh sing your life
all the things that you love
all the things that you loathe
oh sing your, oh sing your
Don't leave it all unsaid
somewhere in the wasteland of your head
and make no mistake, my friend
your pointless life will end
but before you go
can you look at the truth?
You have a lovely singing voice
a lovely singing voice
and all of those
who sing on key
they stole the notion
from you and me

 

MUTE WITNESS

Your poor witness
crying so loudly on the floor
oh but she's only trying to tell you
what it was that she saw
she is only trying to tell you
what it was that she saw
Now see her standing on the table
with her small arms flailing
and you feel such compassion
in your soul for
Your poor mute witness
still testing the strength
of our patience
oh but she's only trying to tell you
what it was that she saw
Now see her pointing to the frisbee
with a memory too fuzzy
as her silent words
describe the fright of last night
4 a.m. Norhtside, Clapham Common
who knows what she was doing there?
will she sketch the answer later?
Well, I'll ask her
"now dry your tears, my dear"
Now see her mime in time so nicely
it would all have been so clear
is only she had never volunteered
"your taxi is here, my dear"

 

KING LEER

Your boyfriend, he
went down on one knee
well, could it be
he's only got one knee?
I tried to surprise you
with Vodka
or, Tizer
I can't quite remember
but you didn't thank me
you didn't even thank me
because you never do
Your boyfriend, he
has the gift of the gab
or, could it be
the gift of the grab?
I tried to surprise you
I lay down beside you
and...nothing much happened
and you didn't phone me
you didn't even phone me
because it's not your style
to dial
Your boyfriend, he
displays to me
more than just
a hint of cruelty
I tried to surprise you
I crept up behind you
with a homeless chihuahua
you gushed for an hour
you handed him back and said
"You'll never guess
I'm bored now"

 

FOUND FOUND FOUND

found found found found found found
someone who's worth it
in this murkiness
someone who's never
seeming scheming
found found found found found found
someone who's worth it
in this murkiness
someone who's never
seeming scheming
Oh, but if I'd never found
oh, but if I'd never found
oh, but if I'd never found
I do believe that
the more you give your love
and I do believe that
the more you offer trust
the more you chase
the more you cry
the more you're bound to lose
the more you're bound to lose
Oh, but if I'd never found
oh, but if I'd never found
somebody
who wants to be
who wants to be
with me
all the time

 

DRIVING YOUR GIRLFRIEND HOME

I'm driving
your girlfriend home
and she's saying
how she never chose you
"turn left", she says
so I turn left
and she says
"So how did I end up
so deeply involved in
the very existence
I planned on avoiding?"
and I can't answer
I'm driving
your girlfriend home
and she's laughing
to stop herself crying
"drive on", she says
so I drive on
and she says
"So how did I end up
attached to this person
when his sense of humour
gets gradually worser?"
and I can't tell her
I'm parking
outside her home
and we're shaking hands
goodnight, so politely

 

THE HARSH TRUTH OF THE CAMERA EYE

Churchillian legs
hair barely there
the harsh truth of the camera eye
Your eyes signal pain
because of the strain
of smiling
the harsh truth of the camera eye
telling you all
that you never wnated to know
showing what
you didn't want shown
My so friendly lens
zooms into
"the inner you"
and it tells the harsh truth
and nothing but
Laugh with us all here
that's if you can
then take the pictures home
and screamtelling you all
that you never wanted to know
showing you what
you didn't want shown
This photographer
he must have really had it in for you
"Oh, I don't want
to be judged anymore
I don't wnat to be judged
I would sooner be Loved
I would sooner be
just blindly Loved..."

 

(I'M) THE END OF THE FAMILY LINE

With no complications
fifteen generations
(of mine)
all honouring Nature
until I arrive
(with incredible style)
I'm the end fo the line
the end of the family line
the end of the line
No baby pulled screaming
out into this seething whirl
by chance or whim
(or even love?)
our family tree hacked into decline
and I'm spared the pain
of ever saying
("goodbye")
I'm the end of the line
the end of the family line
the end of the line

 

THERE'S A PLACE IN HELL FOR ME AND MY FRIENDS

There is a place
reserved
for me and my friends
and when we go
we all will go
so you see
I'm never alone
there is a place
with a bit more time
and a few more
gentler words
and looking back
we do forgive
(we had no choice
we always did)
all that we hope
is that when we go
our skin
and our blood
and our bones
don't get in your way
making you ill
the way they did
when we lived
There is a place
a place in hell
reserved
for me and my friends
and if ever I
wanted to cry
then I will
because I can

 

TONY THE PONY

Still drinking on the corner 
Just don't say I didn't warn you 
Always nagging big brother 
He's only looking out for you 
Tony The Pony 
Tony The Pony 
You're still standing on the corner 
Just don't say I didn't warn you 
Old and jealous big brother 
You had your time and you spent it 
Crying 
Now, Tony The Pony 
Tony The Pony 
So, that's what they call you now ? 
When you're free outside 
So cold and hard and in control 
And ... 
There's a free ride on 
Tony The Pony 
Oh, why do you always wanna stop me 
From doing the things in life that make me happy ? 
And when I'm outside with friends, laughing loudly 
Why do you always wanna stop me ? 
Oh, I would never 
I would never 
But you will carry the can for anyone 
The free ride on 
Gullible Tony 
You're drunker quicker 
And you're sicker even quicker 
For something heavy is gonna fall on you 
Oh ... 
And what do they call you now ? 
When you're free outside 
So cold and hard and in control 
And, oh ... been a lark 
There's a free ride on 
Fucked-up Tony 
I will never say I told you so 
Or how I knew that something bad 
Would happen to you 
I don't wanna say I told you so 
Oh, but Tony, I told you so !!! 
I told you so

 

YOU'RE GONNA NEED SOMEONE ON YOUR SIDE

With the world's fate 
Resting on your shoulder 
You're gonna need 
Someone on your side 
You can't do it by yourself 
Any longer 
You're gonna need 
Someone on your side 
Someone kindly told me 
That you'd wasted 
Eight of nine lives
Oh, give yourself a break 
Before you break down 
You're gonna need someone on your side 
And here I am, And here I am 
Well, you don't need 
To look so pleased ! 
Day or night, 
There is no difference 
You're gonna need someone on your side 
Day or night, 
There is no difference 
You're gonna need someone soon 
And here I am, And here I am 
Well, you don't need 
To look so pleased

 

GLAMOROUS GLUE

First day with the jar 
You find 
Everyone lies 
First day with the jar 
You find 
Everyone lies, nobody minds 
Everyone lies 
Where is the man you respect ? 
And where is the woman you love ? 
Where's the woman you love ? 
Third week with the jar
You find 
Everything dies 
We won't vote Conservative 
Because we never have 
Everyone lies, everyone lies 
Where is the man you respect ? 
And where is the woman you love ? 
Where's the woman you love ? 
Everything of worth 
On Earth Is there To share 
I used to dream, and I used to vow 
I wouldn't dream of it now 
We look to Los Angeles 
For the language we use 
London is dead, London is dead, London is dead...
Now I'm too much in love 
I'm too much in love 
I know 
I'll go 
Empty hand 
From the land

 

WE'LL LET YOU KNOW

How sad are we ? 
And how sad have we been ? 
We'll let you know 
We'll let you know 
Oh, but only if - you're really interested 
You wonder how 
We've stayed alive 'till now 
We'll let you know 
We'll let you know 
But only if - you're really interested 
We're all smiles 
Then, honest, I swear, it's the turnstiles 
That make us hostile 
Oh ... 
We will descend 
On anyone unable to defend 
Themselves 
Oh ... 
And the songs we sing 
They're not supposed to mean a thing 
La, la, la, la ... 
Oh ...You're lonely, Oh ... you're lonely, Oh ... 
GET OFF THE ROOF ! Oh ... 
Your Arsenal !
We may seem cold, or 
We may even be 
The most depressing people you've ever known 
At heart, what's left, we sadly know 
That we are the last truly British people you'll ever know 
We are the last truly British people you will ever know 
You'll never never want to know

 

THE NATIONAL FRONT DISCO

David, the wind blows 
The wind blows ... 
Bits of your life away 
Your friends all say ... 
"Where is our boy ? Oh, we've lost our boy" 
But they should know 
Where you've gone 
Because again and again you've explained that 
You're going to ... 
Oh, you're going to ... 
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah 
England for the English ! 
England for the English ! 
David, the winds blow 
The winds blow ...
All of my dreams away 
And I still say : 
"Where is our boy ? Ah, we've lost our boy" 
But I should know 
Why you've gone 
Because again and again you've explained
You've gone to the ... 
National, ah ... 
To the National .. 
There's a country; you don't live there 
But one day you would like to 
And if you show them what you're made of 
Oh, then you might do ... 
But David, we wonder 
We wonder if the thunder 
Is ever really gonna begin 
Begin, begin 
Your mom says : 
"I've lost my boy" 
But she should know 
Why you've gone 
Because again and again you've explained 
You've gone to the : 
National 
To the National 
To the National Front Disco 
Because you want the day to come sooner 
You want the day to come sooner 
You want the day to come sooner 
When you've settled the score 
Oh, the National 
Oh, the National

 

CERTAIN PEOPLE I KNOW

I take the cue from 
Certain people I know 
I use the cue 
And then I 
Hand it on to you 
And when I swing it 
So, it catches his eye ... 
(Weren't you there ? 
- You'd have died !) 
I trust the views of 
Certain people I know 
They look at Danger 
And they 
LAUGH THEIR HEADS OFF 
Their clothes are Imitation 
George the 23rd 
(Don't you find this absurd ?) 
I'd hate to be like 
Certain people I know 
They break their necks 
And can't afford to
Get them fixed 
Ah, they'd sacrifice all 
Of their principles for 
anything cashable 
I do believe it's terrible 
Oh, wo, wo, Ah, ah, ah, ah, Oh, wo, wo...

 

WE HATE IT WHEN OUR FRIENDS BECOME SUCCESSFUL

We hate it when our friends become successful 
We hate it when our friends become successful 
Oh, look at those clothes 
Now look at that face, it's so old 
And such a video ! 
Well, it's really laughable 
Ha, ha, ha ...
We hate it when our friends become successful 
And if they're Northern, that makes it even worse
And if we can destroy them 
You bet your life we will 
Destroy them 
If we can hurt them 
Well, we may as well ... 
It's really laughable 
Ha, ha, ha ... 
You see, it should've been me 
It could've been me 
Everybody knows 
Everybody says so 
They say : 
"Ah, you have loads of songs 
So many songs 
More songs than they'd stand 
Verse 
Chorus 
Middle eight 
Break, fade 
Just listen ..."
La, la-la, la-la

 

YOU'RE THE ONE FOR ME, FATTY

SEASICK, YET STILL DOCKED

I am a poor freezingly cold soul 
So far from where 
I intended to go 
Scavenging through life's very constant lulls 
So far from where I'm determined to go 
Wish I knew the way to reach the one I love
There is no way ... 
Wish I had the charm to attract the one I love 
But you see, I've got no charm 
Mmm...
Tonight I've consumed much more than I can hold 
Oh, this is very clear to you 
And you can tell I have never really loved 
You can tell, by the way, I sleep all day
And all of my life no-one gave me anything 
No-one has ever given me anything 
My love is as sharp as a needle in your eye 
You must be such a fool 
To pass me by

 

I KNOW IT'S GONNA HAPPEN SOMEDAY

My love, wherever you are 
Whatever you are 
Don't lose faith 
I know it's gonna happen someday 
To you 
Please wait ... Please wait ... Oh ... Wait ... 
Don't lose faith 
You say that the day just never arrives 
And it's never seemed so far away 
Still, I know it's gonna happen someday 
To you 
Please wait ... 
Don't lose faith

 

TOMORROW

Tomorrow 
Will it really come ? 
And if it does come 
Will I still be Human ? 
All I ask of you is one thing that you never do 
Would you put your arms around me ? 
(I won't tell anyone) 
Tomorrow 
Does it have to come ?
All I ask of you is one thing that you'll never do 
Would you put your arms around me ? 
(I won't tell anybody) 
Tomorrow 
And what must come before ...
Oh, the pain in my arms 
Oh, the pain in my legs 
Ooh, my shiftless body 
Tomorrow 
It's surely nearer now ? 
You don't think I'll make it 
I never said I wanted to ! 
Well did I ? 
Oh, the pain in my arms 
Oh, the pain in my legs 
Oh, yeah; oh, yeah, No, yeah; no, yeah 
Through my shiftless body 
Tomorrow, Tomorrow 
All I ask of you ... oh ... 
Is : would you tell me that you love me 
Tell me, tell me that you love me, Tell me, tell me that you love me ... 
Ah, I know you don't mean it 
Ah, I know you don't mean it 
Tell me, tell me that you love me, Tell me, tell me that you love me ...

 

YOU'RE THE ONE FOR ME, FATTY

NOVEMBER SPAWNED A MONSTER

Sleep on and dream of Love
because it's the closest you will get to love
poor twisted child, so ugly, so ugly
poor twisted child, oh hug me, oh hug me
one November spawned a monster 
in the shape of this child who later cried
"But Jesus made me, so Jesus save me from
pity, sympathy and people discussing me"
a frame of useless limbs what can make GOOD
all the BAD that's been done?
And if the lights were out
could you even bear
to kiss her full on the mouth (or anywhere?)
poor twisted child, so ugly, so ugly
poor twisted child, oh hug me, oh hug me
one November spawned a monster 
in the shape of this child who must remain
a hostage to kindess and the wheels underneath her
a hostage to kindess and the wheels underneath her
a symbol of where mad, mad lovers
must PAUSE and draw the line
So sleep and dream of love
because it's the closest
you will get to love
that November is a time which I must put OUT of my mind
oh one fine day 
LET IT BE SOON
she won't be rich or beautiful
but she'll be walking your streets
in the clothes that she went out
and chose for herself

 

SEASICK, YET STILL DOCKED

I am a poor freezingly cold soul 
So far from where 
I intended to go 
Scavenging through life's very constant lulls 
So far from where I'm determined to go 
Wish I knew the way to reach the one I love
There is no way ... 
Wish I had the charm to attract the one I love

THE LOOP

I just wanna say 
I haven't been away 
I'm still right here 
Where I always was 
So one day, if you're bored 
By all means call 
Because you can do 
(But only if you want to) 
I just wanna say 
I haven't been away 
I am still right here 
Where I always was 
So one day, when you're bored 
By all means call 
Because you can do 
But you might not get through

 

SISTER I'M A POET

All over this town 
Yes, a low wind may blow 
And I can see through everybo... 
With no reason 
To hide these words I feel 
And no reason 
To talk about the books I read 
But still I do 
That's 'cause I'm a ... Sister I'm a ... 
All over this town 
Along this way 
Outside the prison gates 
I love the romance of crime 
And I wonder 
Does anybody feel the way I do ? 
And is evil just something you are 
Or something you do ? 
Sister I'm a ... Sister I'm a ... 
All over this town, All over this town 
They pull over 
In their Citroen vans 
Not to shake your hand 
With meths on their breaths 
And you with youth on your side 
A plastic bag stranded at the lights 
This once was me ...
But now I'm a ... Sister I'm a ...
All over this town ... Oh, oh, oh 
All over this town, All over this town, Oh ... 
I still cannot speak French ... I am very lazy

 

JACK THE RIPPER

Oh, you look so tired 
Mouth slack and wide 
Ill-housed and ill-advised 
Your face is as mean 
As your life has been 
Crash into my arms 
I WANT YOU 
You don't agree -
But you don't refuse 
I know you 
And I know a place 
Where no one is likely to pass 
Oh, you don't care if it's late 
And you don't care if you're lost 
And oh, you look so tired 
(But tonight you presumed too much) 
Too much, too much 
And if it's the last 
Thing I ever do 
I'M GONNA GET YOU 
Crash into my arms 
I WANT YOU 
You don't agree -
But you don't refuse 
I know you 
And no one knows a thing about my life 
I can come and go as I please 
And if I want to, I can stay 
Oh, or if I want to, I can leave 
Nobody knows me, Nobody knows me, Nobody knows me Oh, oh...

 

SUCH A LITTLE THING MAKES SUCH A BIG DIFFERENCE

Such a little thing, such a little thing
but the difference it made was grave
there you go
wielding a bicycle chain
oh why won't you change
cange and be nicer?
such a little thing
a gentle tone of kindness
or written words on paper
- can you write?
How I love all of
the very simple things of life
(God's good air)
how I love all of
the very simple things of life
such a little thing
a fumbling politeness
the difference it saved me
wielding a bicycle chain
"I WILL NOT CHANGE AND I WILL NOT BE NICE"
Most people keep their brains between your legs (don't you find?)
Leave me alone - I was only singing, leave me alone because
I was only singing
leave me alone - I was only singing, leave me alone
you have just proved (again)
MOST PEOPLE KEEP THEIR BRAINS BETWEEN THEIR LEGS

 

I KNOW IT'S GONNA HAPPEN SOMEDAY

My love, wherever you are 
Whatever you are 
Don't lose faith 
I know it's gonna happen someday 
To you 
Please wait ... 
Please wait ... 
Oh ... Wait ... 
Don't lose faith 
You say that the day just never arrives 
And it's never seemed so far away 
Still, I know it's gonna happen someday 
To you 
Please wait ... 
Don't lose faith

 

WE'LL LET YOU KNOW

How sad are we ? 
And how sad have we been ? 
We'll let you know, We'll let you know 
Oh, but only if - you're really interested

The most depressing people you've ever known 
At heart, what's left, we sadly know 
That we are the last truly British people you'll ever know 
We are the last truly British people you will ever know 
You'll never never want to know

 

SUEDHEAD

Why do you come here
why do you hang around
I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry
Why do you come here
when you know it makes
things hard for me
when you know, oh
why do you come?
Why do you telephone?
and why send me silly notes?
I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry
why do you come here
when you know it makes
thing hard for me
when you know, oh
why do you come?
You had to sneak into my room
'just' to read my diary
was it just to see all the things
you knew I'd written about you?
and...so many illustrations
I'm so very sickened
oh, I am so sickened NOW

 

HE KNOWS I'D LOVE TO SEE HIM

He Knows (he knows)
Or, I think he does
because when I lived
in the Arse of the world...
he knows, he knows, he knows I'd love
to see him happy (or as close as is allowed)
because when I lived
in the Arse of the world
he knows, he knows, he knows I'd love
to see him happy (or as close as possible
as close as possible, as close as is allowed)
My name still conjours up deadly deeds
and a bad taste in the mouth
the police - they actually knew me
they said:
"You're just another person in the world
you're just another fool with radical views
you're just another who has maddening views
you want to turn it on its head
by staying in bed!"
I said: "I know I do"

 

YOU'RE GONNA NEED SOMEONE ON YOUR SIDE

With the world's fate 
Resting on your shoulder 
You're gonna need 
Someone on your side 
You can't do it by yourself 
Any longer 
You're gonna need 
Someone on your side 
Someone kindly told me 
That you'd wasted 
Eight of nine lives
Oh, give yourself a break 
Before you break down 
You're gonna need someone on your side 
And here I am, And here I am 
Well, you don't need 
To look so pleased ! 
Day or night, 
There is no difference 
You're gonna need someone on your side 
Day or night, 
There is no difference 
You're gonna need someone soon 
And here I am, And here I am 
Well, you don't need 
To look so pleased

 

GLAMOROUS GLUE

First day with the jar 
You find 
Everyone lies 
First day with the jar 
You find 
Everyone lies, nobody minds, Everyone lies 
Where is the man you respect ? 
And where is the woman you love ? 
Where's the woman you love ? 
Third week with the jar
You find 
Everything dies 
We won't vote Conservative 
Because we never have 
Everyone lies, everyone lies 
Where is the man you respect ? 
And where is the woman you love ? 
Where's the woman you love ? 
Everything of worth 
On Earth, Is there, To share 
I used to dream, and I used to vow 
I wouldn't dream of it now 
We look to Los Angeles 
For the language we use 
London is dead, London is dead, London is dead, ...
Now I'm too much in love 
I'm too much in love, 
I know I'll go 
Empty hand 
From the land

 

WE HATE IT WHEN OUR FRIENDS BECOME SUCCESSFUL

We hate it when our friends become successful 
We hate it when our friends become successful 
Oh, look at those clothes 
Now look at that face, it's so old 
And such a video ! 
Well, it's really laughable 
Ha, ha, ha ...
We hate it when our friends become successful 
And if they're Northern, that makes it even worse
And if we can destroy them 
You bet your life we will 
Destroy them 
If we can hurt them 
Well, we may as well ... 
It's really laughable 
Ha, ha, ha ... 
You see, it should've been me 
It could've been me 
Everybody knows 
Everybody says so 
They say : 
"Ah, you have loads of songs 
So many songs 
More songs than they'd stand 
Verse 
Chorus 
Middle eight 
Break, fade 
Just listen ..."
La, la-la, la-la

 

NOW MY HEART IS FULL

There's gonna be some trouble 
A whole house will need re-building 
And everyone I love in the house 
Will recline on an analyst's couch quite 
Soon 
Your Father cracks a joke 
And in the usual way 
Empties the room 
Tell all of my friends 
(I don't have too many 
Just some rain-coated lovers' puny brothers)
Dallow, Spicer, Pinkie, Cubitt 
Rush to danger 
Wind up nowhere 
Patric Doonan - raised to wait 
I'm tired again, I've tried again, and 
Now my heart is full 
Now my heart is full 
And I just can't explain 
So I won't even try to
Dallow, Spicer, Pinkie, Cubitt 
Every jammy Stressford poet 
Loafing oafs in all-night chemists 
Loafing oafs in all-night chemists 
Underact - express depression 
Ah, but Bunnie I loved you 
I was tired again 
I've tried again, and 
Now my heart is full 
Now my heart is full 
And I just can't explain 
So I won't even try to 
Could you pass by ? 
Could you pass by ? 
Oh ... 
Now my heart is full 
Now my heart is full 
And I just can't explain 
So ... slow ... 
Slow ... slow ... slow ... slow ... slow ...

 

SPRING-HEELED JIM

Spring-heeled Jim winks an eye 
He'll "do", he'll never be "done to" 
He takes on whoever flew through 
"Well, it's the normal thing to do" ... ah ... 
Spring-heeled Jim lives to love 
Now kissing with his mouth full 
And his eyes on some other fool 
So many women 
His head should be spinning 
Ah, but no ! 
Ah, but no ! 
But no !
Ah, no !
Spring-heeled Jim slurs the words : 
"There's no need to be so knowing
Take life at five times the 
Average speed, like I do" 
Until Jim feels the chill 
"Oh, where did all the time go ?" 
Once always in for the kill 
Now it's too cold 
And he feels too 
old 
Too old
Mmm, old... 
La, la, la, la-la, la ...

 

BILLY BUDD

Say, Billy Budd 
So you think you should ? 
Oh, everyone's laughing 
Say, Billy Budd 
So you think that you should ? 
Everyone's laughing ! 
Since I took up with you 
Things have been bad 
Yeah, but now it's 12 years on 
Now it's 12 years on 
Yes, and I took up with you 
I took my job application 
Into town 
Did you hear ? They turned me down 
Yes, and it's all because of us 
Oh, and what was in our eyes 
Oh, what was in our eyes, yeah 
I said, Billy Budd 
I would happily lose 
Both of my legs 
I would lose both of my legs 
Oh, if it meant you could be free 
Oh, if it meant you could be free 
(Don't leave us in the dark!)

 

HOLD ON TO YOUR FRIENDS

A bond of trust 
Has been abused 
Something of value 
May be lost 
Give up your job 
Squander your cash - be rash 
Just hold on to your friends 
There are more than enough 
To fight and oppose 
Why waste good time 
Fighting the people you like 
Who will fall defending your name 
Oh, don't feel so ashamed 
To have friends 
But now you only call me 
When you're feeling depressed 
When you feel happy I'm 
So far from your mind 
My patience is stretched 
My loyalty vexed 
Oh, you're losing all of your friends 
Hold on to your friends 
Hold on to your friends 
Resist - or move on 
Be mad, be rash 
Smoke and explode 
Sell all of your clothes 
Just bear in mind : 
Oh, there just might come a time 
When you need some friends

 

THE MORE YOU IGNORE ME, THE CLOSER I GET

The more you ignore me 
The closer I get 
You're wasting your time 
The more you ignore me 
The closer I get 
You're wasting your time 
I will be 
In the bar 
With my head 
On the bar 
I am now 
A central part 
Of your mind's landscape 
Whether you care 
Or do not 
Yeah, I've made up your mind 
The more you ignore me 
The closer I get 
You're wasting your time 
The more you ignore me 
The closer I get 
You're wasting your time 
Beware !
I bear more grudges 
Than lonely high court judges 
When you sleep 
I will creep 
Into your thoughts 
Like a bad debt 
That you can't pay 
Take the easy way 
And give in 
Yeah, and let me in 
Oh, let me in 
Oh let me ... 
Oh, let me in 
IT'S WAR 
IT'S WAR 
WAR 
WAR 
Oh, let me in 
Ah, the closer I get 
Ah, you're asking for it 
Ah, the closer I get 
Ooh, the closer I ...

 

WHY DON'T YOU FIND OUT FOR YOURSELF

The sanest days are mad 
Why don't you find out for yourself ? 
Then you'll see the price 
Very closely 
Some men here 
They have a special interest 
In your career 
They wanna help you to grow 
And then syphon all your dough 
Why don't you find out for yourself ? 
Then you'll see the glass 
Hidden in the grass 
You'll never believe me, so 
Why don't you find out for yourself ? 
Sick down to my heart 
That's just the way it goes 
Some men here 
They know the full extent of 
Your distress 
They kneel and pray 
And they say : 
"Long may it last" 
Why don't you find out for yourself ?
Then you'll see the glass 
Hidden in the grass 
Bad scenes come and go 
For which you must allow 
Sick down to my heart 
That's just the way it goes 
Don't rake up my mistakes 
I know exactly what they are 
And ... what do YOU do ? 
Well ... you just SIT THERE 
I've been stabbed in the back 
So many many times 
I don't have any skin 
But that's just the way it goes

 

I AM HATED FOR LOVING

I am hated for loving 
I am hated for loving 
Anonymous call, a poison pen 
A brick in the small of the back again 
I still don't belong 
To anyone - I am mine 
And I am hated for loving 
I am haunted for wanting 
Anonymous call, a poison pen 
A brick in the ... ah ... 
A brick in the small of the back again 
I still don't belong 
To anyone - I am mine 
I am falling 
With no-one to catch me 
I am falling 
And there's still 
No-one to catch me 
Ah .. 
Anonymous call, a poison pen 
A brick in the ... ah ... 
A brick in the small of the back again 
I just don't belong 
To anywhere 
I just don't belong 
Mmm ... 
Ah ...

 

LIFEGUARD SLEEPING, GIRL DROWNING

Always looking for attention 
Always needs to be mentioned 
Who does she 
Think she should be ? 
The shrill cry through darkening air 
Doesn't she know he's 
Had such a busy day ? 
Tell her ... sshhh
Somebody tell her ... sshhh 
Slowest ... 
It was only a test 
But she swam too far 
Against the tide 
She deserves all she gets 
The sky became marked with stars 
As an out-stretched arm slowly 
Disappears 
Hooray 
Oh hooray 
No, oh, oh, woh, there's no movement 
No, oh, hooray 
Oh, hooray 
Please don't worry 
There'll be no fuss 
She was ... nobody's nothing 
(What's your name ?) 
When he awoke 
The sea was calm 
And another day passes like a dream 
There's no ... no way 
(What's your name ?)

 

USED TO BE A SWEET BOY

Used to be a sweet boy 
Holding so tightly 
To Daddy's hand 
But that was all 
In some distant land 
Blazer and tie 
And a big bright healthy smile 
Used to make all 
Of our trials worthwhile 
Used to be a sweet boy 
And I'm not to blame 
Something went wrong 
And I know 
I'm not to blame 
Something went wrong 
Can't be to blame 
Ah ...

 

THE LAZY SUNBATHERS

A world war 
Was announced 
Days ago 
But they didn't know 
The lazy sunbathers 
The lazy sunbathers 
The sun burns through 
To the planet's core 
And it isn't enough 
They want more 
Nothing 
Appears 
To be 
Between the ears of 
The lazy sunbathers 
Too jaded 
To question stagnation 
The sun burns through 
To the planet's core 
And it isn't enough 
They want more 
Religions fall 
Children shelled 
"...Children shelled ? That's all 
Very well, but would you 
Please keep the noise 
Down low ? 
Because you're waking 
The lazy sunbathers ..."
Oh, the lazy sunbathers 
The lazy sunbathers

 

SPEEDWAY

And when you slam 
Down the hammer 
Can you see it in your heart ? 
All of the rumours 
Keeping me grounded 
I never said, I never said that they were 
Completely unfounded 
So when you slam 
Down the hammer 
Can you see it in your heart ? 
Can you delve so low ? 
And when you're standing 
On my fingers 
Can you see it in your heart ? ... ah ... 
And when you try 
To break my spirit 
It won't work 
Because there's nothing left to break 
Anymore 
All of the rumours 
Keeping me grounded 
I never said, I never said that they were 
Completely unfounded 
You won't sleep 
Until the earth that wants me 
Finally has me 
Oh you've done it now 
You won't rest 
Until the hearse that becomes me 
Finally takes me 
Oh you've done it now 
And you won't smile 
Until my loving mouth 
Is shut good and proper 
FOREVER 
All of the rumours 
Keeping me grounded 
I never said, I never said that they were 
Completely unfounded 
And all those lies 
Written lies, twisted lies 
Well, they weren't lies 
They weren't lies 
They weren't lies 
I never said 
I never said 
I could have mentioned your name 
I could have dragged you in 
Guilt by implication 
By association 
I've always been true to you 
In my own strange way 
I've always been true to you 
In my own sick way 
I'll always stay true to you

 

THE TEACHERS ARE AFRAID OF THE PUPILS

There's too many people 
Planning your downfall 
When your spirit's on trial 
These nights can be frightening 
Sleep transports sadness 
To some other mid-brain 
And somebody here 
Will not be here next year 
So you stand by the board 
Full of fear and intention 
And, if you think that they're listening 
Well, you've got to be joking 
Oh, you understand change 
And you think it's essential 
But when your profession 
Is humiliation 
Say the wrong word to our children ...
We'll have you, oh yes, we'll have you 
Lay a hand on our children 
And it's never too late to have you 
Mucus on your collar 
A nail up through the staff chair 
A blade in your soap 
And you cry into your pillow 
To be finished would be a relief 
To be finished would be a relief... 
Say the wrong word to our children ...
We'll have you, oh yes, we'll have you 
Lay a hand on our children 
And it's never too late to have you 
To be finished would be a relief 
To be finished would be a relief...
I'm very glad this thing has come 
Sometimes I'm so glad 
Never bother to play the tunes 
I've seen it coming for dear life

 

READER MEET AUTHOR

You don't know a thing about their lives 
They live where you wouldn't dare to drive
You shake as you think of how they sleep 
But you write as if you are my side-by-side 
Reader, meet Author 
With the hope of hearing sense 
But you may be feeling let down 
By the words of defence 
He says : "No-one ever sees me when I cry"
You don't know a thing about their lives 
Books don't save them, books aren't Stanley knives 
And if a fight broke out here tonight 
You'd be the first away, because you're that type 
And the Year 2000 won't change anyone here 
As each fabled promise flies so fast 
You'll swear it was never there 
Oh, have you ever escaped from a shipwrecked life ? 
So safely with your software; all miles from the front line 
You hear the way their sad voices, and you start to imagine things 
Oh, any excuse to write more lies

 

THE BOY RACER

He's just too good-natured and 
He's got too much money and 
He's got too many girlfriends 
I'm jealous, that's all 
Have you seen him go, though, oh ? 
Have you seen him go, though, oh ? 
Boy racer, Boy racer, oh 
We're gonna kill this pretty thing 
Boy racer, Boy racer, oh 
We're gonna kill this pretty thing 
He's got many girlfriends 
He thinks he owns this city 
He overspeeds and he never gets pulled over 
Have you seen him go, though, oh ? 
Have you seen him go, though, oh ? 
Boy racer, Boy racer, oh 
We're gonna kill this pretty thing 
Boy racer, Boy racer, oh 
We're gonna kill this pretty thing 
He thinks he got the whole world in his hands 
Stood at the urinal 
He thinks he got the whole world in his hands 
And I'm gonna ... kill him !
Oh, no ! Oh, no ! Oh, no ! Oh, no ! Oh, no !Oh .... 
Boy racer Boy racer, oh 
We're gonna kill this pretty thing...
He's just too good-looking, and, And, and ... 
Boy racer Boy racer, oh 
We're gonna kill this pretty thing...

 

THE OPERATION

You fight with your right hand 
And caress with your left hand 
Everyone I know is sick to death of you 
With a tear that's a mile wide 
In the kite that you're flying 
Everyone I know is sick to death of you 
Ever since 
You don't look the same 
You're just not the same, no way 
You say clever things and 
You never used to 
You don't catch what I'm saying 
When you're deafened to advice 
Everyone here is sick to the 
Back teeth of you 
With a tear that's a mile wide 
In the kite that you're flying 
Everyone here is sick to the 
Tattoo of you 
Ever since 
You don't look the same 
You're just not the same, no way 
You say pleasant things and 
There is no need to
Still, you fight with your right hand 
And caress with your left hand 
Ooh, ooh ... Sad to say ... 
How once I was in love with you 
Sad to say ... 
You don't catch what I'm saying 
When you're deafened to advice 
Ooh, ooh ... Ever since 
You don't look the same 
You're just not the same, no way 
What the hell have 
They stuck into you ?

 

DAGENHAM DAVE

Head in the clouds, and a mouthful of pie 
Head in a blouse, everybody loves him 
I see why 
Dagenham Dave, Dagenham Dave, Oh, Dagenham Dave 
Dagenham Dave, Dagenham Dave, Oh, Dagenham Dave 
"I love Karen, I love Sharon" on the windowscreen 
With never the need to fight or to question a single thing 
Dagenham Dave, Dagenham Dave Oh, Dagenham Dave 
Dagenham Dave, Dagenham Dave Oh, Dagenham Dave ...
He'd love to touch, he's afraid that he might self-combust 
I could say more, but you get the general idea

Dagenham, Dagenham Dagenham Dave, Dagenham Dave ...
Oh, Dave, oh, Dagenham, dagenham, Oh, Dave, oh, Dave, ...

 

DO YOUR BEST AND DON'T WORRY

Compare the best of their days 
With the worst of your days 
You won't win 
With your standards so high 
And your spirits so low 
At least remember ... 
This is you on a bad day, you on a pale day 
Just do your best and don't ... Don't worry, oh 
The way you hang yourself is oh, so unfair 
See the best of how they look 
Against the worst of how you are
And again, you won't win 
With your standards so high 
And your spirits so low 
At least remember ... 
This is you on a drab day, you in a drab dress 
Just do your best and don't ... Don't worry, oh 
The way you hang yourself is oh, so unfair 
Just do your best and don't ... Don't worry, oh 
The way you watch yourself is oh, so unfair 
Just do your best and don't ... Don't worry, oh 
Do your best and don't ...

SOUTHPAW

You were a boy before you became a man 
I don't see the joy 
And you ran with your pals in the sun 
You turned around and they were gone 
Again ... 
A sick boy should be treated 
So easily defeated 
Oh, I just don't understand 
So you ran with your pals in the sun 
You turned around 
You were alone 
Again ... 
And you ran back to Ma 
Which set the pace for the rest of your days 
Oh, you ran back to Ma 
Which set the pace for the rest of your days 
Oh, you ran back to Ma 
Which set the pace for the rest of your days 
And now, there is something that you should know 
There is something that you should know 
The girl of your dreams is 
Here all alone 
Girl of your dreams is 
Here all alone 
The girl of your dreams is 
Sad and all alone 
The girl of your dreams is 
Here all alone 
There is something that you should know 
There is something that you should know 
Girl of your dreams is 
Here all alone 
The girl of your dreams is 
Sad and is all alone 
The girl of your dreams is 
Sad and is feeling all alone 
Oh, there is something that you should know 
Help me, help me, help me ...

 

MALADJUSTED

I wanna start from 
Before the beginning 
Loot wine, "Be mine, and 
Then let's stay out for the night"
Ride via Parkside 
Semi-perilous lives 
Jeer the lights in the windows 
Of all safe and stable homes 
(But wondering then, well what 
Could peace of mind be like ?)
Anyway do you want to hear 
Our story, or not ? 
As the Fulham Road lights 
Stretch and invite into the night 
From a Stevenage overspill 
We'd kill to live around 
SW6 - with someone like you 
Keep thieves' hours 
With someone like you 
...As long as it slides 
You stalk the house 
In a low-cut blouse : 
"Oh Christ, another stifled 
Friday night !"
And the Fulham Road lights 
Stretch and invite into the night 
Well, I was fifteen 
What could I know ?
When the gulf between 
All the things I need 
And the things I receive 
Is an ancient ocean 
Wide, wild, lost, uncrossed 
Still I maintain there's nothing 
Wrong with you 
You do all that you do 
Because it's all you can do 
Well, I was fifteen 
Where could I go ?
With a soul full of loathing 
For stinging bureaucracy 
Making it anything 
Other than easy 
For working girls like me 
With my hands on my head 
I flop on your bed 
With a head full of dread 
For all I've ever said 
Maladjusted, maladjusted 
Maladjusted maladjusted 
Never to be trusted 
Oh, never to be trusted 
There's nothing wrong with you, oh 
...There's nothing wrong with you

 

ALMA MATTERS

So : the choice I have made 
May seem strange to you 
But who asked you, anyway ? 
It's my life to wreck 
My own way 
You see : to someone, somewhere, oh yeah ... 
Alma matters 
In mind, body and soul 
In part, and in whole 
Because to someone, somewhere, oh yeah ... 
Alma matters 
In mind, body and soul 
In part, and in whole 
So the life I have made 
May seem wrong to you 
But, I've never been surer 
It's my life to ruin 
My own way 
You see : to someone, somewhere, oh yeah ... 
Alma matters 
In mind, body and soul 
In part, and in whole 
Because to someone, somewhere, oh yeah ... 
Alma matters 
In mind, body and soul 
In part, and in whole 
To someone, somewhere, oh yeah ... 
Alma matters 
In mind, body and soul 
Part, and in whole 
So to someone, somewhere, oh yeah ... 
Alma matters 
In mind, body and soul 
Part, and in whole 
To someone, somewhere, oh yeah ... 
Oh yeah ... Oh yeah, oh yeah Oh yeah ...

 

AMBITIOUS OUTSIDERS

Bolt-lock your doors 
Alarm your cars 
And still we move in closer 
Every day 
Top of the list 
Is your smiling kids 
But we'll be smiling too 
So that's OK 
Oh, and by the way 
Thank you, because you're 
Giving, giving, giving 
And we're receiving - 
No, no, we're taking 
Keeping the population down 
Your taxes paid, but 
Police waylaid 
And we knows 
When the school bus 
Comes and goes 
We're on your street, but 
You don't see us 
Or, if you do 
You smile and say Hello 
BUT DON'T UNDERESTIMATE US 
When you are 
Giving, giving, giving 
And we're receiving - 
No, no, we're taking 
Just keeping 
The population down 
You're giving, giving, giving 
Well, it's your own fault 
For reproducing 
We're just keeping 
The population down

 

TROUBLE LOVES ME

Trouble loves me 
Trouble needs me 
Two things 
More than you do 
Or would attempt to 
So, console me 
Otherwise, hold me 
Just when it seems like 
Everything's evened out 
And the balance 
Seems serene 
Trouble loves me 
Walks beside me 
To chide me 
Not to guide me 
It's still much more 
Than you'll do 
So, console me 
Otherwise, hold me 
Just when it seems like 
Everything's evened out 
And the balance seems serene 
See the fool I'll be 
Still running 'round 
On the flesh rampage 
Still running 'round 
Ready with ready-wit 
Still running 'round 
On the flesh rampage 
- At your age ! 
Go to Soho, oh 
Go to waste in 
The wrong arms 
Still running 'round 
Trouble loves me 
Seeks and finds me 
To charlatanize me 
Which is only 
As it should be 
Oh, please fulfill me 
Otherwise, kill me 
Show me a barrel and watch me scrape it 
Faced with the music, as always I'll face it 
In the half-light 
So English, frowning 
Then at midnight I 
Can't get you out of my head 
A disenchanted taste 
Still running 'round 
A disenchanted taste 
Still running 'round

 

PAPA JACK

Papa Jack 
Wants to turn 
Back the clock 
And reach out 
To the kids 
He once had 
Who have flown 
Papa Jack 
In decline 
Feels inclined 
To reach out 
To the kids 
He once had 
Who have flown 
But there was a time 
When the kids reached up 
And Papa Jack just 
Pushed them away 
Looking deep 
In his heart 
Papa Jack 
Doesn't like 
What he sees 
Or the time 
On his hands 
The dying day 
The chilly sun 
Papa Jack 
All alone 
Sings slow 
Grieving and low 
But there was a time 
When the kids reached up 
Now you can't always 
Have it your way 
Papa Jack 
Ah ...

 

AMMUNITION

I know these roads 
Each ridge 
And narrow bridge 
Each cheveron 
Enticing me on 
Each warning sign 
I take in my stride 
I don't need more ammunition 
I've got more than I can spend 
I don't dwell on things I'm missing 
I'm just pleased 
With the things I've found 
I know these roads 
An old hand understands 
Above all, I know what's 
Expected of me now 
Veering cliffwards 
I don't need more ammunition 
I've got more than I can spend 
I don't dwell on things I'm missing 
I'm just pleased 
With the things I've found 
With the things I've found 
With the things I've found 
I've found 
I've been crying 
It comes back on these salient days 
And it stays 
And it says : 
"We've never really been away" 
I don't need more ammunition 
I've got more than I can spend 
I don't think of who I'm missing 
I've got no space and no time 
In my life, anymore 
No space or time 
In my life, anymore 
For Revenge

 

WIDE TO RECEIVE

Download something 
Useful, or useless 
Because I'm lying here 
Wide to receive 
Almost anything 
You'd care to give 
And I don't 
Get along with myself 
And I'm not too keen 
On anyone else 
Turn on, plug in 
Then just walk away 
Unlock, process 
And then just go 
And I've never felt quite so alone 
As I do right now 
I'm lying here 
Wide to receive 
Almost anything 
You'd care to leave 
Wide, wide, wide Wide, wide, wide...

 

ROY'S KEEN

(GO ON !)
He's romancing you 
And chancing his arm 
He'll be here 
Smiling on time 
He's romancing you 
And chancing his arm 
He'll be here 
Smiling on time 
Roy's keen oh Roy's keen 
Roy's keen oh Roy's keen 
We've never seen a 
Keener window-cleaner 
Back up the ladder 
Into each corner 
Dunking the chamois 
Just think of the goodwill 
The ladder's a planet 
Roy is a star, and 
I am a satellite 
(But that's alright) 
He can hold a smile for as long 
As you require (even longer) 
He can hold a smile for as long 
As you require (even longer) 
Roy's keen oh Roy's keen 
Roy's keen oh Roy's keen 
We've never seen a 
Keener window-cleaner 
Back up the ladder 
Into each corner 
Dunking the chamois 
Just think of the goodwill 
The ladder's a planet 
Roy is a star, and 
I am a satellite 
I will be set alight 
Don't say you'll hold it steady 
Then you let it go 
Don't say you'll hold it steady 
Then you let it go Oh ...
You're up the ladder 
Into each corner 
Foot in a bucket 
We trust you to wreck it 
Even when it's under your nose 
Well, you just can't 
See it, can you ? 
Well, it's here 
Right under your nose 
And you just can't 
See it, can you? La la la la ...
Roy's keen, Roy's keen La la la la ...
We've never seen a 
Keener window-cleaner 
Oh ... La la la la ...

 

HE CRIED

I need you 
Simple words 
But words which had never been heard 
By the soul 
Stoned to death 
But still living 
And so he froze where he stood 
And he looked to the ground 
And he cried 
He cried 
Ride our minds 
If you must 
But there's always a line you don't cross 
Time is short 
Don't be cruel 
Oh you don't know the power 
In what you're saying 
Oh ... 
And so he froze where he stood 
And he looked to the ground 
And he cried 
He cried 
People where 
I come from 
They survive without feelings or blood 
I never could 
Was stoned to death 
But I'm still living 
So he froze where he stood 
And he looked to the ground 
And he cried 
He cried 
So he froze 
And he looked, and he looked 
To the ground 
And he cried 
He cried

 

SORROW WILL COME IN THE END

Legalized theft 
Leaves me bereft 
I get it straight in the neck 
(Somehow expecting no less) 
A court of justice 
With no use for Truth 
Lawyer ...liar 
Lawyer ...liar 
You pleaded and squealed 
And you think you've won 
But Sorrow will come 
To you in the end 
And as sure as my words are pure 
I praise the day that brings you pain 
Q.C.'s obsessed with sleaze 
Frantic for Fame 
They're all on the game 
They just use a different name 
You lied 
And you were believed 
By a J.P. senile and vile 
You pleaded and squealed 
And you think you've won 
But Sorrow will come 
To you in the end 
And as sure as my words are pure 
I praise the day that brings you pain 
So don't close your eyes 
Don't close your eyes 
A man who slits throats 
Has time on his hands 
And I'm gonna get you 
So don't close your eyes 
Don't ever close your eyes 
You think you've won 
OH NO

 

SATAN REJECTED MY SOUL

Satan rejected my soul 
He knows my kind 
He won't be dragged down 
He's seen my face around 
He knows Heaven doesn't seem 
To be my home 
So I must find 
Somewhere else to go 
So I must find 
Somewhere else to go 
So, take it - please 
It's free 
You'll never see 
You'll never see 
All the fun in life it's cost me 
Satan rejected my soul 
As low as he goes 
He never quite goes this low 
He's seen my face around 
He knows Heaven doesn't seem 
To be my home 
So I must find 
Somewhere else to go 
So I must find 
Somewhere else to go 
So, take it please 
It's really sly 
Come on, come on, ah Come on, come on, come on 
Take it please, It's really sly 
Come on, come on, ah Come on, come on, come on 
Call me in, Pull me in, call me in 
Come on, come on, oh Come on, come on, come on 
Pull me in, pull me in, Call me in, haul me in, pull me in 
Come on, come on, ah, Come on, come on 
La la la la la, Oh ...

 
 REEL AROUND THE FOUNTAIN

It's time the tale was told
of how you took a child
and you made him old
Reel around the fountain
slap me on the patio
I'll take it now
Fifteen minutes with you
well, I wouldn't say no
people said that you were virtually dead
and they were so wrong
fifteen minutes with you
well, i wouldn't say no
people said that you were easily led
and they were half-right
I dreamt about you last night
and i fell out of bed twice
you can pin and mount me like a butterfly
but take me to the haven of your bed
was something that you never said
two lumps, please
you're the bee's knees
but so am I
Meet me at the fountain
shove me on the patio
I'll take it slowly
Fifteen minutes with you
oh I wouldn't say no
people see no worth in you
oh but I do

 

YOU'VE GOT EVERYTHING NOW

As merry as the days were long
I was right and you were wrong
back at the old grey school
I would win and you would lose
But you've got everything now
and what a terrible mess I've made of my life
No, I've never had a job
because I've never wanted one
I've seen you smile
but I've never really heard you laugh
So who is rich and who is poor?
I cannot say...
You are your mother's only son
and you're a desperate one
But I don't want a lover
I just want to be seen in the back of your car
A friendship sadly lost?
Well, this is true ...and yet, it's false
Did I ever tell you , by the way
I never did like your face
But you've got everything now
and what a terrible mess I've made of my life
No, I've never had a job
because I'm too shy
But I don't want a lover
I just want to be tied to the back of your car.

 

MISERABLE LIE

So, goodbye
please stay with your own kind
and I'll stay with mine
There's something against us
it's not time
So, goodbye
I know I hardly say
how much I love your casual way
but please put your tongue away
a little higher and we're well away
the dark nights are drawing in
and your humour is as black as them
I look at yours, you laugh at mine
and"love" is just a miserable lie
you have destroyed my flower like-life
not once-but twice
you have corrupt my innocent mind
not once-but twice
I know that wind-swept mystical air
it means: I'd like to see your underwear
I recognise that mystical air
it means: I'd like to see your underwear
what do we get for the trouble and pain?
just a rented room in Whalley Range
into the depths of the criminal world
I followed her...
I need advice, I need advice
because nobody ever looks at me twice
I'm just a country-mile behind
the world
I'm just a country mile behind
the whole world
so take me when you go

 

PRETTY GIRLS MAKE GRAVES

Upon the sand,upon the bay
"there is a quick and easy way" you say
before you illustrate
I'd rather state:
"I'm not the man you think I am
I'm not the man you think I am "
And Sorrow's native son
he will not smile for anyone
And pretty girls makes the graves
End of the pier, end of the bay
you tug my arm and say:"Give into lust,
give up to lust, oh heaven knows we'll
soon be dust..."
But I'm not the man you think I am
I'm not the man you think I am
And Sorrow's native son
he will not rise for anyone
And pretty girls make graves
I could have been wild and I could have been free
but Nature played this trick on me
She wants it Now
and she will not wait
but she's too rough
and I'm too delicate
Then on the sand
another man, he takes her hand
and a smile lights up her stupid face
(and well, it would)
I lost my faith in Womanhood
I lost my faith in Womanhood, I lost my faith

 

THE HAND THAT ROCKS THE CRADLE

Please don't cry
the ghost and the storm outside
will not invade this sacred shire
nor infiltrate your mind
my life down I shall lie
if the bogey-man should try
to play tricks on your sacred mind
to tease, torment and tantalise
wavering shadows loom
a piano plays in an empty room
there'll be blood on the cleaver tonight
when darkness lifts and the room is bright
I'll still be by your side
for you are all that matters
and I'll love you till the day I die
there never need to be longing in your eyes
as long as the hand that rocks the cradle is mine
ceiling shadows shimmy by
and when the wardrobe towers like a beast of prey
there's a sadness in your beautiful eyes
you're untouched, unsoiled, wonderous eyes
my life down I shall lie
should restless spirts try
to play tricks on you sacred mind
but whom I never gave a name
I just looked into his wonderous eyes
and said" never never never again"
all too soon I did return
just like a moth to a flame
so rattle my bones all over the stones
because I'm only a beggar-man whom nobody owns
see how words as old as sin
fit me like a glove I'm here and here I'll stay
together we lie, together we pray
there never need be longing in your eyes
as long as the hand that rocks the cradle is mine

 

STILL ILL

I decree today that life
is simply taking and not giving
England is mine and it owes me a living
ask me why, and I'll spit in your eye
ask me why, and I'll spit in your eye
but we cannot cling to the old dreams anymore
no, we cannot cling to the old dreams anymore
Does the body rule the mind
or does the mind rule the body?
I dunno...
Under the iron bridge we kissed
and although I ended up with sore lips
it just wasn't like the old days anymore
no, it wasn't like those days
am I still ill?
Does the body rule the mind
or does the mind rule the body ?
I dunno...
Ask me why, and I'll die
ask me why, and I'll die
and if you must go to work tomorrow
well, if I were you I wouldn't bother
for there are brighter sides to life
and I should know because I've seen them
but not very often...
under the iron bridge we kissed
and although I ended up with sore lips
it just wasn't like the old days anymore
no, it wasn't like those days
am I still ill?

 

HAND IN GLOVE

Hand in glove
the sun shines out of our behinds
no, it's not like any other love
this one is different-because it's us
Hand in glove
we can go wherever we please
and everything depends upon
how near you stand to me
And if the people stare
then the people stare
I really don't know and I really don't care
Hand in glove
the Good People laugh
yes, we may be hidden by rags
but we have something they'll never have
So, hand in glove I stake my claim
I'll fight to the last breath
If they dare touch a hair on your head
I'll fight to the last breath
The Good Life is out there, somewhere
so stay on my arm, you little charmer
But I know my luck too well
and I'll probably never see you again.

 

WHAT DIFFERENCE DOES IT MAKE?

All men have secrets and here is mine
so let it be known
we have been through hell and high tide,
I can surely rely on you?
and yet you start to recoil,
heavy words are so lightly thrown
but still I'd leap in front of a flying bullet for you
So, what difference does it make?
so, what difference does it make?
it makes none
but you have gone
and you must be looking very old tonight
The devil will find work for idle hands to do
I stole and I lied, and why?
because you asked me to!
but now you make feel so ashamed
because I've only got two hands
well, I'm still fond of you
So, what difference does it make?
so, what difference does it make?
it makes none
but you have gone
and your prejudice won't keep you warm tonight
So, no more apologies
no more apologies
I'm too tired
I'm too sick and tired
and I'm feeling very sick and ill today
But I'm still fond of you

 

I DON'T OWE YOU ANYTHING

Bought on stolen wine
a nod was the first step
you know very well
what was coming next
did I really walk all this way
just to hear you say
"oh I don't want to go out tonight"
but you will
for you must
I don't owe you anything
but you owe me something
repay me now
you should never go to them
let them come to you
just like I do
you should not go to them
let them come to you
just like I do
Too freely on your lips
words prematurely said
oh but I know what will make you smile tonight
Life is never kind
life is never kind
oh but I know what will make you smile tonight

 

SUFFER LITTLE CHILDREN

Over the moors,take me to the moors
dig a shallow grave
and I'll lay me down
Lesley-Anne, with your pretty white beads
oh John, you'll never be a man
and you'll never see your home again
oh Manchester, so much to answer for
Edward, see those alluring lights?
tonight will be your very last night
a woman said "I know my son is dead
I'll never rest my hands on his scared head"
Hindley wakes and Hindley says:
"Wherever he has gone, I have gone "
But fresh lilaced moorland fields
cannot hide the stoild stench of death
Hindley wakes and Hindley says:
"Whatever he has done, I have done"
But this is no easy ride
for a child cries
"find me...find me, nothing more
we're on a sullen misty moor
we may be dead and we may be gone
but we will be right by your side
until the day you die
this is no easy ride
we will haunt you when you laugh
yes, you could say we're a team
you might sleep
BUT YOU WILL NEVER DREAM!"
Oh Manchester, so much to answer for
Oh Manchester, so much to answer for
Over the moor, I'm on the moor
the child is on the moor

 

THE HEADMASTER RITUAL

Belligerent ghouls

spineless swines
cemented mines

I don't want to stay
Belligerent ghouls

spineless bastards all
Sir leads the troops

I wanna go home
I don't want to stay

 

RUSHOLME RUFFIANS

The last night at the fair
by the big wheel generator
a boy is stabbed
and his money is grabbed
and the air hangs heavy like a dulling wine
she is famous
she is funny
an engagement ring
doesn't mean a thing
to a mind consumed by brass(money)
and though I walk home alone
my faith in love is still devout
the last night at the fair
from a seat on a whirling waltzer
her skirt ascends for a watching eye
it's a hideous trait( on her mother's side)
and though I walk home alone
my faith in love is still devout
then someone falls in love
and someone's beaten up
and the senses being dulled are mine

of a speedway operator
is all a tremulous heart requires
a schoolgirl is denied
she said "How quickly would I die
if I jumped from the top of the parachutes?"

I WANT THE ONE I CAN'T HAVE

On the day that your mentality
catches up with your biology
I want the one I can't have
and it's driving me mad
it's written all over my face
A double-bed
and a stalwart lover, for sure
these are the riches of the poor
A double-bed
and a stalwart lover, for sure
these are the riches of the poor
a tough kid who sometimes swallows nails
raised on Prisoner's Aid
he killed a policeman when he was thirteen
and somehow that really impressed me
it's written all over my face
On the day that your mentality
catches up with your biology
And if you ever need self-validation
just meet me in the alley by the
railway-station
it's written all over my face

 

WHAT SHE SAID

What she said:
"How come someone hasn't noticed
that I'm dead
and decided to bury me
God knows, I'm ready"
What she said was
but then, all the rejection she's had
to pretend to be happy
could only be idiocy
What she said was not for the job or
lover that she never had
What she read
all heady books
she'd sit and prophesise
(it took a tattoed boy from Birkenhead
to really really open her eyes)

THAT JOKE ISN'T FUNNY ANYMORE

Park the car at the side of the road
you should know
time's tide will smother you
and I will too
when you laugh about other people who feel so
very lonely
their only desire is to die
well I'm afraid
it doesn't make me smile
I wish I could laugh
but that joke isn't funny anymore
it's too close to home and it's too near the bone
it's too close to home and it's too near the bone
more than you'll ever know
It was dark as I drove the point home
and on cold leather seats
well, it suddenly struck me
I just might die with a smile on my
face after all
I've seen this happen in other people's lives
and now it's happening in mine

 

NOWHERE FAST

I'd like to drop my trousers to the world
I am a man of means(of slender means)
each household appliance
is like a new science in my town
and if a day came when I felt a natural emotion
I'd get such a shock I'd probably jump in the ocean
and when a train goes by
it's such a sad sound
I'd like to drop my trousers to the Queen
every sensible child will know what this means
the poor and the needy
are selfish and greedy on her terms
and if the day came when I felt a natural emotion
I'd get such a shock I'd probably jump in the ocean
and when a train goes by
it's such a sad song
And when I'm lying in my bed
I think about life
and I think about death
and neither one particularly appeals to me
and if the day came when I felt a natural emotion
I'd get such a shock I'd probably lie
in the middle of the street and die
I'd lie down and die

 

WELL I WONDER

Well I wonder
do you hear me when you sleep?
I hoarsely cry
Well I wonder
do you see me when we pass?
I half-die
Please keep me in mind
please keep me in mind
Gasping-but somehow still alive
this is the fierce last stand of all I am
Gasping-dying-but somehow still alive
this is the final stand of all I am
Please keep me in mind

 

BARBARISM BEGINS AT HOME

Unruly boys
who will not grow up
must be taken in hand
Unruly girls
who will not settle down
they must be taken in hand
A crack on the head
is what you get for not asking
and a crack on the head

MEAT IS MURDER

Heifer whines could be human cries
closer comes the screaming knife
this beautiful creature must die
this beautiful creature must die
a death for no reason
and death for reason is MURDER
and the flesh you so fancifully fry
is not succulent, tasty or nice
it's death for no reason
and death for no reason is MURDER
and the calf that you carve with a smile
is MURDER
and the turkey you festively slice
is MURDER
do you know how animals die?
kitchen aroma aren't very homely
it's not "comforting," "cheery" or kind
it's sizzling blood and the unholy stench
of MURDER
it's not "natural," "normal" or kind
the fleas you so fancifully fry
as you savour the flavour
of MURDER
NO, NO, NO, IT'S MURDER
NO, NO, NO, IT'S MURDER
who hears when animals cry?

 

THE QUEEN IS DEAD

Farewell to this lands cheerless marches
hemmed in like a boar between arches
her very Lowness with her head in a sling
Im truely sorry-but it sounds like a wonderful thing
dear Charles, dont you ever crave
to appear on the front of the Daily mail
dressed in your Mother's bridal veil?
So, I checked all the registered historical facts
and I was shocked into shame to discover
how Im the 18th pale descendent
of some, old queen or other
has the world changed, or have I changed?
has the world changed, or have I changed?
as some 9-year old tough peddles drugs
(I never even knew what drugs were)
And so, I broke into the Palace
with a sponge and a rusty spanner
she said: "Eh, I know you, and you cannot sing"
I said: "that's nothing -you should hear me play piano"
We can go for a walk where it's quiet and dry
and we can talk about precious things
but when you are tied to your mother's apron
not one talks about castration
We can go for a walk where it's quiet and dry
and we can talk about precious things
like love and law and poverty
these are the things that kill me
We can go for a walk where it's quiet and dry

but the rain that flattens my hair
theses are the things that kill me
Passed the Pub that saps your body
and the church who'll snatch your money
the Queen is dead, boys
and it's so lonely on a limb
Pass the Pub that wrecks your body
and the church-all they want is your money
the Queen is dead, boys`
you can trust me, boys
life is very long, when you're lonely
life is very long, when you're lonely...

 

FRANKLY MR.SHANKLY

Frankly, Mr Shankly, this position Ive held
it pays my way, but it corrodes my soul
I want to leave you will not miss me
I want to go down in musical history
Frankly, Mr Shankly, Im a sickening wreck
Ive got the 21st Century breathing down my neck
I must move fast, you understand me
I want to go down in celluloid history
Fame, Fame, fatal Fame
it can play hideous tricks on the brain
but still I rather be Famous
than righteous or holy, any day
but sometimes Id feel more fulfilled
making Christmas cards with the mentally ill
I want to Live and I want to Love
I want to catch something that I might be ashamed of
Frankly, Mr Shankly, this position I've held
it pays my way and it corrodes my soul
oh, I didnt realise that you wrote poetry
(I didnt realise you wrote such bloody awful poetry)
Frankly, Mr Shankly, since you ask
you are a flatulent pain the arse
I do not mean to be so rude
but still, I must speck frankly, Mr Shankly

 

I KNOW IT'S ALL OVER

Oh Mother, I can fell the soil falling over my head
and as i climb into an empty bed
Oh well, Enough said
I know it's over-still I cling
I don't know where else I can go
Oh Mother, I can feel the soil falling over my head
see, the sea want s to take me
the knife wants to cut me
do you think you can help me?
Sad veiled bride, please be happy
handsome groom, give her room
loud, loutish lover, treat her kindly
(although she needs you
more than she loves you)
and I know it's over
and it never really began
but in my heart it was so real
and you even spoke to me and said:
"If you're so funny
then why are you on your own tonight?
and if you are so clever
then why are you on your own tonight?
if you're so terribly good looking
then why do you sleep alone tonight?
because tonight is just like any other night
that's why you're on your own tonight
with your triumphs and your charms
while they are in each other's arms.."
It's so easy to laugh
it's so easy to hate
it takes strength to be gentle and kind
It's so easy to laugh
it's so easy to hate
it takes guts to be gentle and kind
love is Natural and Real
but not for you, my love
not tonight my love
love is Natural and Real
but not for such as you and I, my love
Oh Mother, I can fell the soil falling over my head
Oh Mother, I can fell the soil falling over my head...

 

NEVER HAD NO ONE EVER

When you walk without ease
on these
the very streets where you were raised
I had a really bad dream
it lasted 20 years, 7 months, and 27 days
Never had no one ever.

 

CEMETERY GATES

A dreaded sunny day
so I meet you at the cemetry gates
Keats and Yeats are on your side
A dreaded sunny day
so I meet you at the cemetry gates
Keats and Yeats are on your side
while Wilde is on mine
So we go inside and we gravely read the stones
all those people all those lives
where are they now ?
with loves, and hates
and passions just like mine
they were born
and then they lived and then they died
which seems so unfair
and I wantr to crv
You say: "ere thrice the sun hath done salutation to the dawn"
and you claim these words as your own
but Im well-read, have heard them said
a hundred times (maybe less, maybe more)
if you must write prose/poems
the words you use should be your own
dont plagiarise or take "on loans"
there's alweays someone, somewhere
with a big nose, who knows
and who trips you up and laughs
when you fall
You say: "ere long done do does did "
words which could only be your own
you then produce the text
from whence was ripped
(some dizzy whore, 1804)
A dreaded sunny day
so let's go where we're happy
so I meet you at the cemetry gates
Keats and Yeats are on your side
A dreaded sunny day
so let's go where we're wanted
so I meet you at the cemetry gates
Keats and Yeats are on your side
but you lose
because Wilde is on mine

 

BIGMOUTH STRIKES AGAIN

Sweetness, sweetness I was only joking
when I said Id like to smash every tooth
in your head
Sweetness, sweetness I was only joking
when I said by right s you should be
bludgeoned in your bed
and now I know how Joan of Arc felt
now I know how Joan of Arc felt
as the flames roseto her roman nose
and her Walkman stared to melt
Bibmouth, bigmouth
bigmouth strikes again
and Ive got no right to take my place
with the Human race
and now I know how Joan of Arc felt
now I know of Joan of Arc felt
as the flames rose to her roman nose
and her hearing aid started to melt
Bigmouth, bigmouth
bigmouth strikes again

THE BOY WITH A THORN IN HIS SIDE

The boy with the thorn in his side
behind the hatred there lies
a murderous desire for love
how can they look into my eyes
and still they dont believe me
how can they hear me say those words
and still they dont believe me
and if they don't believe me now
will they ever believe me?
and if they don't believe me now
will they ever believe me?
The boy with the thorn in his side
behind the hatred there lies
a plundering desire for love
how can they see the Love in our eyes
and still they don't believe us
and after all this time
they don't want to believe us
and if they dont believe us now
will they ever believe us ?
andd when you want to Live
how do you start ?
where do you go ?
who do you know?

 

VICAR IN A TUTU

I was minding mind business
lifting some lead off
the roof of the Holy Name church
it was worthwhile living a laughable life
just to set my eyes on a blistering sight
of a vicar in a tu-tu
he's not strange
he just wants to live his life this way
a scanty bit of a thing
with a decorative ring
that wouldn't cover the head of a child
as Rose collects the money in the cannister
who comes sliding down the bannister
the vicar in a tu-tu
he's not strange
he just wants to live his life this way
the monkish monsignor
with a head full of plaster
said "my man, get your vile soul dry-cleaned"
as Rose counts the money in the cannister
as natural as rain
he dances again
vicar in a tu-tu
The next day in the pulpit
with Freedom and Ease
combating ignoranca,dust and disease
as Rose counts the money in the cannister
as natural as rain
he dances again
the fabric of a tu-tu
any man could get us to
and I am a living sign.

 

THERE IS A LIGHT THAT NEVER GOES OUT

Take me out tonight
where there's music and there's people
who are young and alive
driving in your car
I never never want to go home
because I havent got one
anymore
take me out tonight
because I want to see people and I
want to see lights
driving in your car
oh please dont drop me home
because it's not my home, it's their
home, and Im welcome no morw
and if a double-decker bus
crashes in to us
to die by your side
such a heavenly way to die
and if a ten ton truck
kills the both of us
to die by your side
the pleasure and the privilege is mine
take me out tonight
oh take me anywhere, I dont care
and in the darken underpass
I thought Oh God, my chance has come at last
(but then a strange fear gripped me and I just couldn't ask)
take me out tonight
take me anywhere, I dont care
just driving in your car
I never never want to go home
because I havent got one
I havent got one.

 

SOME GIRLS ARE BIGGER THAN OTHERS

From the ice-age to the dole-age
there is but one concern
and I have just discover
some girls are bigger than others
some girls are bigger than others
some girls mothers are bigger than
other girls mothers
As Anthony said to Cleopatra
as he opened a crate of ale:
some girls are bigger than others
some girls are bigger than others
some girls mothers are bigger than
other girls mothers.

 

A RUSH AND A PUSH AND AND THE LAND IS OURS

HELLO
I am the ghost of Troubled Joe
hung by his pretty white neck
some eighteen months ago
I travelled to a mystical time zone
but I missed my bed
so I soon came home
they said:
"there's too much caffeine
in your bloodstream
and a lack of real spice
in your life"
I said:
"leave me alone
because I'm alright, dad
just surprised to still
be on my own...."
Ooh, but don't mention love
I'd hate the real strain of the pain again
a rush and a push and the land that
we stand on is ours
it has been before
so it shall be again
and people who are uglier than you and I
they take what they need, and leave
Ooh, but don't mention love
I'd hate the pain and the strain all over again
a rush and a push and the land that
we stand on is ours
it has been before
so why can't it be now?
and people who are weaker than you and I
they take what they want from life
Ooh, but don't mention love
no - just don't mention love!
a rush and a push and the land that
we stand on is ours
your youth may be gone
but you're still a young man
so phone me, phone me, phone me
so phone me, phone me, phone me
Ooh, I think I'm in love...
Urrgh, I think I'm in lerv

 

I STARTED SOMETHING I COULDN'T FINISH

The lanes were silent
with nothing or no one around for miles
I doused our friendly venture
with a hard-faced
three-word gesture
I started something
I forced you into a zone
and you were clearly
never meant to go
hair brushed and parted
typical me, typical me, typical me
I started something
...and now I'm not too sure
I grabbed you by the guilded beams
that's what Tradition means
and I doused another venture
with a gesture
that was...absolutely vile
I started something
forced you to a zone
and you were clearly
never meant to go
hair brushed and parted
typical me, typical me, typical me
I started something
...and now I'm not too sure
I grabbed you by the guilded beams
that's what Tradition means
and now eighteen months' hard-labour
seems...fair enough
I started something

DEATH OF A DISCO DANCER

The death of a disco dancer
well, it happens a lot 'round here
and if you think Peace
is a common goal
well, that goes to show
just how little you know
The death of a disco dancer
well, I'd rather not get involved
I never talk to my neighbour
I'd just rather not get involved
Love, peace and harmony?
Love, peace and harmony?
Oh, very nice, very nice, very nice, very nice
...but maybe in the next world.

 

GIRLFRIEND IN A COMA

Girlfriend in a coma, I know
I know - it's serious
Girlfriend in a coma, I know
I know - it's really serious
there wree times when I could
have 'murdered' her
(but, you know, I would hate
anything to happen to her)
NO, I DON'T WANT TO SEE HER
Do you really think
she'll pull through?
Do you really think
she'll pull through?
Girlfriend in a coma, I know
I know, it's serious

WOULD YOU PLEASE LET ME SEE HER!
Do you really think she'll pull through?
Do you really think she'll pull through?
Let me wisper my last goodbyes
I know - IT'S SERIOUS

 

STOP ME IF YOU'VE HEARD THIS ONE BEFORE

Stop me, stop me,
stop me if you think that you've heard this one before
stop me, stop me
stop me if you think that you've heard this one before
nothing's changed
I still love you, oh I still love you
...only slightly less than I used to
I was delayed, I was way-laid
an emergency stop
I smelt the last ten seconds of life
I crashed down on the crossbar
and the pain was enough to make
a shy, bald buddhist reflect
and plan a mass-murder
who said I'd lied to her?
who said I'd lied because I never
who said I'd lied because I never
I was detained, I was restrained
he broke my spleen
he broke my knees
(and then he really laid into me)
Friday night in Out-patients
who said I'd lied to her?
who said I'd lied - because I never
who said I'd lied - because I never
Oh, so I drank one
or was it four
and when I fell on the floor
...I drank more
stop me, stop me
stop me if you think that you've heard this one before
nothing's changed
I still love you, I still love you
but only slightly
less than I used to

 

LAST NIGHT I DREAMT THAT SOMEBODY LOVED ME

Last night I dreamt
that somebody loved me
no hope - but no harm
just another false alarm
Las night I felt
real arms around me
no hope - no harm
just another false alarm
so, tell me how long
before the last one?
and tell me how long
before the right one?
this story is old - I KNOW
but it goes on
this story is old - I KNOW
but it goes on

 

UNHAPPY BIRTHDAY

I've come to wish you an unhappy birthday
I've come to wish you an unhappy birthday
because you're evil
and you lie
and if you should die
I may feel slightly sad
(but I won't cry)
Loved and lost
and some may say
when usually its Nothing
surely you're happy
it should be this way?
I say "No, I'm gonna kill my dog"
and: "May the lines sag heavy
and deep tonight XXX"

PAINT A VULGAR PICTURE

At the record company meeting
On their hands - a dead star
and ooh, the plans that they weave
and ooh, the sikening greed
At the record company meeting
on their hands - a dead star
the sycophantic slags all say:
"I knew him first, and I knew him well"
Re-issue! Re-package! Re-package!
Re-evaluate the songs
double-pack with a photograph
Extra Track (and a tacky badge)
A-list, playlist
"Please them, please them!"
"Please them! Please them!"
(sadly, THIS was your life)
but you could have said no
if you'd wanted to
you could have said no
if you'd wanted to
BPI, MTV, BBC
"Please them! Please them!"
(sadly this was your life)
but you could have said no
if you'd wanted to
you could have walked away
...couldn't you?
I touched you at the soundcheck
you had no real way of knowing
in my heart I bgged "please, take
me with you...
I don't care where you're going"
But to you I was faceless
I was fawning, I was boring
just a child from those ugly new houses
who could never begin to know
who could never really know
Best of? Most of?
Satiate the need
slip them into different sleeves!
Buy both, and be decieved
climber - new entry, re-entry
World tour! ("media whore")
"Please the Press in Belgium!"
(THIS was your life...)
and when it fails to recoup?
Well, maybe:
You just haven't earned it yet, baby
I walked a pace behind you at the soundcheck
you're just the same as I am
what makes most people feel happy
leads us headlong into harm
so, in my bedroom in those 'ugly new houses'
I dance my legs down to the knees
but me and my 'true love'
we will never meet again...
At the record company meeting
on their hands - at last! - a dead star!
but they cannot taint you in my eyes
no, they cannout touch you now
No, they cannot hurt you my darling
they cannot touch you now
but me and my 'true love'
will never meet again

 

DEATH AT ONE'S ELBOW

Ooh Glenn, don't come to the house tonight
Ooh, Glenn, don't come to the house tonight
because there's somebody here
who really really loves you
stay home
be bored
(it's crap, I KNOW)
Ooh, Glenn, don't come to the house tonight
Ooh, Glen, don't come to the house tonight
because there's somebody here
who'll take a hatchet to your ear
how the frustration renders me
hateful, Glenn!
don't come to the house tonight
don't come to the house tonight
because you'll slip on the
trail of my bespattered remains
and so, that's why
GOODBYE MY LOVE, GOODBYE MY LOVE, GOODBYE MY LOVE...
Belch

 

I WON'T SHARE YOU

I won't share you
I won't share you
with the drive and ambition
and the zeal I feel
this is my time
as the note I wrote
was read, she said
has the Perrier gone
straight to my head
or is life plainly sick and cruel, instead?
"YES!"
No-no-no-no-no-no
I won't share you
I won't share you
with the drive and the dreams inside
this is my time
Life tends to come and go
well, that's OK
just as long as you know
Life tends to come and go
well, that's OK
just as long as you know
I won't share you
I won't share you

this is my time, this is my time


THE QUEEN IS DEAD

Farewell to this lands cheerless marches
hemmed in like a boar between arches
her very Lowness with her head in a sling
Im truely sorry-but it sounds like a wonderful thing
dear Charles, dont you ever crave
to appear on the front of the Daily mail
dressed in your Mother's bridal veil?
So, I checked all the registered historical facts
and I was shocked into shame to discover
how Im the 18th pale descendent
of some, old queen or other
has the world changed, or have I changed?
has the world changed, or have I changed?
as some 9-year old tough peddles drugs
(I never even knew what drugs were)
And so, I broke into the Palace
with a sponge and a rusty spanner
she said: "Eh, I know you, and you cannot sing"
I said: "that's nothing -you should hear me play piano"
We can go for a walk where it's quiet and dry
and we can talk about precious things
but when you are tied to your mother's apron
not one talks about castration
We can go for a walk where it's quiet and dry

PANIC

Panic on the streets of London
Panic on the streets of Birmingham
I wonder to myself
Could life ever be sane again
on the Leeds side-streets that you slip down
I wonder to myself
Hopes may rise on the Grasmeres
But Honey Pie, you're not safe here
So you run down
To the safety of the town
But there's Panic on the streets of Carlisle
Dublin, Dundee, Humberside
I wonder to myself
Burn down the Disco
Hang the blessed D.J.
Because the music that they constantly play
IT SAYS NOTHING TO ME ABOUT MY LIFE
Hang the blessed D.J.
Because the music they constantly play
On the Leeds side-streets that you slip down
On the provincial towns that you jog 'round
Hang the D.J.,. Hang the D.J.,.Hang the D.J...

ASK

Shyness is nice, but
Shyness can stop you
From doing all the things in life
That you'd like to
So, if there's something you'd like to try
ASK ME-I WON'T SAY "NO"-HOW COULD I?
Coyness is nice, but ,
Coyness can stop you
from saying all the things in
life that you want to
If there's something that you'd like to try
ASK ME-I WON'TSAY"NO"-HOW COULD I?
Spending warm, Summer days indoors
Writing fringhtening verse
To a buck-toothed girl in Luxembourg
ASK ME, ASK ME ,ASK ME, ASK ME, ASK ME ,ASK ME
Because if it's not Love
Then it's the Bomb
That will bring us together
Nature is a language-can't you read?
Nature is a language-can't you read?
ASK ME, ASK ME ,ASK ME, ASK ME, ASK ME ,ASK ME
Because if it's not Love
Then it's the Bomb

MARIE'S THE NAME (HIS LATEST FLAME) / RUSHOLME RUFFIANS

Very old friend 
Came by today 
As he was telling everyone in town 
Of all the love that he'd just found 
And Marie's the name (of his latest flame) 
Talked and talked 
And I heard him say 
That she had the longest blackest hair 
Prettiest green eyes anywhere 
And Marie's the name (of his latest flame) 
The last night of the fair 
By the big wheel generator 
A boy is stabbed 
His money is grabbed 
And the air hangs heavy like a dulling wine 
She is Famous 
She is Funny 
An engagement ring 
Doesn't mean a thing 
To a mind consumed by brass (money), oh 
The last night of the fair 
From a seat on a whirling waltzer 
Her skirt ascends for a watching eye 
It's a hideous trait (on her mother's side)
From a seat on a whirling waltzer 
Her skirt ascends for a watching eye 
A hideous trait (on her mother's side) 
Then someone falls in love 
Someone's beaten up 
Someone's beaten up 
And the senses being dulled are mine 
And someone falls in love 
Someone's beaten up 
And the senses being dulled are mine 
This is the last night of the fair 
And the grease in the hair 
Of a speedway operator 
Is all a tremulous heart requires 
A schoolgirl is denied 
She said : "How quickly would I die 
If I jumped from the top of the parachutes ?"
This is the last night of the fair 
And the grease in the hair 
Of a speedway operator 
Is all a tremulous heart requires 
A schoolgirl is denied 
She said : "How quickly would I die 
Oh, if I jumped from the top of the parachutes ?"
...Oh, walk home alone 
I might walk home alone 
But my faith in love is still devout

 

THE BOY WITH THE THORN IN HIS SIDE

The boy with the thorn in his side
behind the hatred there lies
a murderous desire for love
how can they look into my eyes
and still they dont believe me

and if they don't believe me now
will they ever believe me?

RUBBER RING / WHAT SHE SAID

Yeah! What she says : 
"How come someone hasn't noticed 
That I'm dead 
And decided to bury me ? 
God knows, I'm ready !"
La-la-la ... 
What she said was sad 
But then, all the rejection she's had 
To pretend to be happy 
Could only be idiocy 
La-la-la ... 
What she said was not for the job or 
Lover that she never had 
No no no ... 
What she read 
All heady books 
She'd sit and prophesise 
(It took a tattooed boy from 
Birkenhead 
To really really open her eyes)

IS IT REALLY SO STRANGE?

I left the North 
I travelled South 
I found a tiny house 
And I can't help the way I feel 
Oh yes, you can kick me 
And you can punch me 
And you can break my face 
But you won't change the way I feel 
'Cause I love you, Oh ... 
And is it really so strange ? 
Oh, is it really so strange ? 
Oh, is it really so, really so strange ? 
I say NO, you say YES 
(and you will change your mind) 
I left the South 
I travelled North 
I got confused - I killed a horse 
I can't help the way I feel 
Oh yes, you can punch me 
And you can butt me 
And you can break my spine 
But you won't change the way I feel 
'Cause I love you, Oh ... 
And is it really so strange ? 
Oh, is it really so strange ? 
Oh, is it really so, really so strange ? 
I say NO, you say YES 
(But you will change your mind) 
I left the North again 
I travelled South again 
And I got confused - I killed a nun 
I CAN'T HELP THE WAY I FEEL 
(I lost my bag in Newport Pagnell) 
Why is the last mile the hardest mile ? 
My throat was dry, with the sun in my eyes 
And I realised, I realised 
I could never 
I could never, never, never, go back home again

 

CEMETERY GATES

A dreaded sunny day
so I meet you at the cemetry gates
Keats and Yeats are on your side
A dreaded sunny day
so I meet you at the cemetry gates
Keats and Yeats are on your side
while Wilde is on mine
So we go inside and we gravely read the stones
all those people all those lives
where are they now ?
with loves, and hates
and passions just like mine
they were born
and then they lived and then they died
which seems so unfair
and I wantr to crv
You say: "ere thrice the sun hath done salutation to the dawn"
and you claim these words as your own
but Im well-read, have heard them said
a hundred times (maybe less, maybe more)
if you must write prose/poems
the words you use should be your own
dont plagiarise or take "on loans"
there's alweays someone, somewhere
with a big nose, who knows
and who trips you up and laughs
when you fall
You say: "ere long done do does did "
words which could only be your own
you then produce the text
from whence was ripped
(some dizzy whore, 1804)
A dreaded sunny day
so let's go where we're happy
so I meet you at the cemetry gates
Keats and Yeats are on your side
A dreaded sunny day
so let's go where we're wanted
so I meet you at the cemetry gates
Keats and Yeats are on your side
but you lose
because Wilde is on mine

 

LONDON

Smoke
Lingers 'round your fingers
Train
Heave on - to Euston
Do you think you've made
The right decision this time?
You left
Your tired family grieving
And you think they're sad because you're leaving
But didn't you see the Jealousy in the eyes
Of the ones who had to stay behind?
And do you think you've made
The right decision thins time?
You left
Your girlfriend on the platform
With thei really ragged notion that you'll return
But she knows
That when he goes
He really goes
So do you think you've made
The right decision this time?

 

I KNOW IT'S OVER

I can feel the soil falling over my head 
And as I climb into an empty bed 
Oh well. Enough said. 
I know it's over - still I cling 
I don't know where else I can go 
Over ... 
Oh Mother, I can feel the soil falling over my head 
See, the sea wants to take me 
The knife wants to cut me 
Do you think you can help me ? 
Sad veiled bride, please be happy 
Handsome groom, give her room 
Loud, loutish lover, treat her kindly 
(Though she needs you 
More than she loves you) 
And I know it's over - still I cling 
I don't know where else I can go 
Over, it's over, it's over, it's over 
It's over, la ... 
I know it's over 
And it never really began 
But in my heart it was so real
And you even spoke to me, and said : 
"If you're so funny 
Then why are you on your own tonight ? 
And if you're so clever 
Then why are you on your own tonight ? 
I know ... 
'Cause tonight - it's just like any other night 
That's why you're on your own tonight 
Your triumphs and your charms 
While they're in each other's arms..."
It's so easy to laugh 
It's so easy to hate 
It takes strength to be gentle and kind 
Over, over, over, over 
It's so easy to laugh 
It's so easy to hate 
It takes guts to be gentle and kind 
Over, over 
Love is Natural and Real 
But not for you, my love 
Not tonight, my love 
Love is Natural and Real 
But not for such as you and I, my love 
Oh Mother, I can feel the soil falling over my head...
Oh Mother, I can feel the soil fall over, fall over my head 
Oh Mother, I can feel the ... fall over my ... , Oh ...

 

THE DRAIZE TRAIN

A vastly superior version of the instrumental B-side, acting as a peace 
offering to Marr (Morrissey chose the tracks for the compilation, 
and of course, receives no royalties on this track).

 

STILL ILL

I decree today that life
is simply taking and not giving
England is mine and it owes me a living
ask me why, and I'll spit in your eye
ask me why, and I'll spit in your eye
but we cannot cling to the old dreams anymore
no, we cannot cling to the old dreams anymore
Does the body rule the mind
or does the mind rule the body?
I dunno...
Under the iron bridge we kissed
and although I ended up with sore lips
it just wasn't like the old days anymore
no, it wasn't like those days
am I still ill?
Does the body rule the mind
or does the mind rule the body ?
I dunno...
Ask me why, and I'll die
ask me why, and I'll die
and if you must go to work tomorrow
well, if I were you I wouldn't bother
for there are brighter sides to life
and I should know because I've seen them
but not very often...
under the iron bridge we kissed
and although I ended up with sore lips
it just wasn't like the old days anymore
no, it wasn't like those days
am I still ill?

 

BIGMOUTH STRIKES AGAIN

Sweetness, sweetness I was only joking
when I said Id like to smash every tooth
in your head
Sweetness, sweetness I was only joking
when I said by right s you should be
bludgeoned in your bed
and now I know how Joan of Arc felt
now I know how Joan of Arc felt
as the flames roseto her roman nose
and her Walkman stared to melt
Bibmouth, bigmouth
bigmouth strikes again
and Ive got no right to take my place
with the Human race
and now I know how Joan of Arc felt
now I know of Joan of Arc felt
as the flames rose to her roman nose
and her hearing aid started to melt
Bigmouth, bigmouth
bigmouth strikes again
and Ive got no right to take my place
with the Human race

 
ALSATIAN COUSTIN

Were you and he Lovers?
and would you say so if you were?
on a forecourt
on a Friday
passing my way
Were you and he Lovers?
and if you were, then say that you were!
on a groundsheet
under canvas
with your tent-flap
open wide
A note upon his desk:
"P.S. Bring Me Home And Have Me!"
Leather elbows on a tweed coat
- Oh! -
Is THAT the best you can do?
So came his reply:
"...but on the desk is where I want you!"
So I ask (even though I know):
were you and he Lovers?

 

LITTLE MAN, WHAT NOW?

An afternoon nostalgia
television show
you spoke in silhouette
(but they couldn't name you)
although the panel were
very polite to you
but I remembered you
from Friday nights 1969
ATV - you murdered every line
too old to be a child star
too young to take leads
four seasons passed
and they AXED you
nervously juvenile
(WON'T SMILE!)
What became of you?
did that swift eclipse torture you?
a star at eighteen
and then-suddenly gone
down to a few lines
in the back page of a teenage annual
oh but I remembered you
I looked up to you

 

EVERYDAY IS LIKE SUNDAY

Trudging slowly over wet sand
back to the bench
where your clothes were stolen
this is the coastal town
that they forgot to close down
Armageddon - come Armageddon!
Come Armageddon! Come!
Everyday is like Sunday
everyday is silent and grey
Hide on the promenade
scratch out a postcard
"how I dearly with I was not here"
in the seaside town
...that they forgot to bomb
Come! Come! Come - nuclear bomb!
Everyday is like Sunday
everyday is silent and grey
Trudging back over pebbles and sand
and a strange dust lands on your hands
(and on your face)
Everyday is like Sunday
"Win Yourself A Cheap Tray"
share some greased tea with me
everyday is silent and grey

 

BENGALI IN PLATFORMS

No no no
he does not want to depress you
oh no no no no no
he only wants to impress you
Bengali in platform
she only wants to embrace your culture
and to be your friend forever
Bengali, Bengali
oh shelve your Western plans
and understand that life is hard enough when you belong here
A silver-studded rim that glistens
and an ankle-star that...blinds me
a lemon sole so very high
which only reminds me, to tell you
so I break the news gently
I break the news to you gently
"Shelve your plans"
Bengali, Bengali
its the touchy march of time
that blinds you
don't blame me
don't hate me
just because I'm the one to tell you
that life is hard enough when you belong here
life is hard enough when you belong here
shelve your western plans
life is hard enough when you belong here

 

ANGEL, ANGEL, DOWN WE GO TOGETHER

Angel, Angel
don't take your life tonight
I know they take
and that they take in turn
and they give you nothing real
for yourself in return
and when they've used you
and they've broken you
and wasted all your money
and cast your shell aside
and when they've bought you
and they've sold you
and they've billed you for the pleasure
and they've made your parents cry
I will be here
BELIEVE ME
I will be here
...believe me
Angel, don't take your life
some people have got no pride
they do not understand
the Urgency of life
but I love you more than life
I love you more than life
I love you more than life
I love you more than life

 

LALE NIGHT, MAUDLIN STREET

The last night on Maudlin Street
goodbye house
goodbye stairs
I was born here
I was raised here, and
...I took some stick here
love at first sight
may sound trite
but it's true, you know
I could list the details
of everything you ever wore
or said, or how you stood that day
and as we spend the last night
on Maudlin Street, I say
"goodbye house-forever!"
I never stole a happy hour
around here
Where the world's ugliest boy
became what you see
here I am - the ugliest man
Its the last night on Maudlin Street
and truly I do love you
oh, truly I do love you
When I sleep with that picture of
you framed beside my bed
oh, it's childish and it's silly
but I think it's you in my room
by the bed (...yes, I told you it was silly...)
and I know
I took strange pills
but I never meant to hurt you
oh truly I love you
I came home late one night
everyone had gone to bed
nobody stays up for you
when you have sixteen stitches
all around your head
the last buss I missed to Maudlin Street
so, he drove me home in the Van
complaining: "Women only like me for my mind..."
don't leave your torch behind
power-cuts ahead
as we crept through the park
but no I cannot steal a pair of jeans
off a clothesline for you
but you...without clothes
oh I could not keep a straight face
me - without clothes?
well a nation turns its back and gags...
I'm packed
I am moving house
a half-life disappears today
every slag waves me on
(secretly wishing me gone
well, I will be soon
oh - I will be soon)
There were bad times on Maudlin Street
when they took you away in a police car
dear Inspector - don't you know?
don't you care?
don't you know - about Love?
Your gran died
and your mother died
on Maudlin Street
in pain and ashamed
with never time to say
those special things
I took the keys from Maudlin Street
well, it's only bricks and mortar!
and...truly I do love you
wherever you are
wherever you are

 

SUEDHEAD

Why do you come here
why do you hang around
I'm so sorry
I'm so sorry
Why do you come here
when you know it makes
things hard for me
when you know, oh
why do you come?
Why do you telephone?
and why send me silly notes?
I'm so sorry
I'm so sorry
why do you come here
when you know it makes
thing hard for me
when you know, oh
why do you come?
You had to sneak into my room
'just' to read my diary
was it just to see all the things
you knew I'd written about you?
and...so many illustrations
I'm so very sickened
oh, I am so sickened NOW

 

BREAK UP THE FAMILY

The strange logic of your clumsiest line
stayed emblazoned on my mind
break up the family
and lets begin to live our lives
I went to see all my friends tonight
it wasn't Youth, it wasn't even Life
born Old, sadly wise
resigned (well, we were)
to ending our lives
I'm so glad to grow older
to move away from those awful times
I want to see all my friends tonight
Yes you found love but you weren't
at peace with your life
home late, full of Hate
despise the ties that bind
oh I'm so glad to grow older
to move away from those younger years
now I'm in love for the first time
and I don't feel bad
Let me see all my old friends
let me put my arm around them
because I really do love them
now, does that sound mad?
Captain of games, solid framed
I stood on the touchline
hailstones, driven home
in his car - no breaks? I don't mind
I'm just so glad to grow older
to move away from those darker years
I'm in love for the first time
and I don't feel bad
so wish me luck my friends
goodbye

 

HAIRDRESSER ON FIRE

Here is London
here is London
is it home of the free,
or what?
can you squeeze me
into an empty page of your diary
and psychologically save me
I've got faith in you
I sense the power
in the fingers
within an hour the power
can totally destroy me
or it could same my life
here is London
'home of the brash, outrageous
and free'
you are repressed
but you're remarkably dressed
is it Real?
but you're far to busy
busy scissors
busy clippers
hair dresser on fire
all around Sloane Square
and you're far too busy
to see me
"busy,busy"
hairdresser on fire
was a client over-cautious
he made you nervous
and when he said
"I'm gonna sue you"
I really felt for you
so can you squeeze me
into an empty page of your diary
and supernaturally change me
CHANGE ME, CHANGE ME

 

THE ORDINARY BOYS

Ordinary boys, happy knowing nothing
happy being no one, but themselves
Ordinary girls, supermarket clothes
who think it's very clever to be cruel to you
for you were so different
you stood all alone
and you knew
that it had to be so
avoiding ordinary boys
happy going nowhere, just around here
in their rattling cars
and ordinary girls
never seeing further
than the cold, small streets
that trap them
but you were so different
you had to say no
when those empty fools
tried to change you, and claim you
for the lair of their ordinary world
where they feel so lucky
so lucky, so lucky
with their lives laid out before them
they're so lucky, so lucky
so lucky, so lucky

 

I DON'T MIND IF YOU FORGET ME

I don't mind
I don't mind if you forget me
having learned my lesson
I never left an impression on anyone
so now you send me your hardened 'regards'
when once you'd send me 'love'
sincerely I must tell you
your mild 'best wishes'
they make me suspicious
but I don't mind
I don't mind if you forget me
having learned my lesson
I never left
an impression on anyone
the pressure to change, to move on
was strange
and very strong
so this is why I tell you
I really do understand
BYE BYE
I don't mind if you forget me
no no no no no no no
REJECTION IS ONE THING
BUT REJECTION FROM A FOOL
IS CRUEL
REJECTION IS ONE THING
BUT REJECTION FROM A FOOL
IS CRUEL
and I don't mind if you forget me
I don't mind if your forget me

 

DIAL-A-CLICHE

Further into the fog I fall
well, I was just
following you!
when you said:
"Do as I do and scrap your fey ways"
(dial-a-cliche)
"grow up, be a man, and close your mealy-mouth!"
(dial-a-cliche)
But the person underneath
where does he go?
does he slide by the wayside?
or...does he just die?
when you find that you've organized
your feelings, for people
who didn't like you then
and certainly don't like you now
yet still you say:
"Do as I do and scrap your fey ways"
(dial-a-cliche)
"grow up, be a man, and close your mealy-mouth!"
(dial-a-cliche)
"the Safe way is the only way!
there's always time to change, son!"
yes well I've changed
but I'm in pain!
dial-a-chiche

 

MARGARET ON THE GUILLOTINE

The kind people
have a wonderful dream
Margaret on the guillotine
because people like you
make me feel so tired
when will you die?
when will you die?
when will you die?
when will you die?
when will you die?
because people like you
make me feel so old inside
please die
and kind people
do not shelter this dream
make it real
make the dream real
make the dream real
make it real

 

OUR FRANK

Our frank and open
deep conversations
they get me nowhere
they bring me down, so
give it a rest, won't you?
give me a cigarette
God give me patience
just no more conversation
Give us a drink
and make it quick
or else I'm gonna be sick
sick all over
your frankly vulgar
red pullover
now see how the colours blend
Our frank and open
deep conversations
they get me nowhere
they bring me down, so
give it a rest, won't you?
now will you just give over
the world may be ending
but look, I'm only human
Give us a drink
and make it quick
or else I'm gonna be sick
all over
your frankly vulgar
red pullover
now see how the two colours blend
Won't somebody stop me
from thinking all the time
about everything
so deeply
so bleakly

 

ASIAN RUT

Day oh so late
strangely the sun still shone
oh Asian boy
what are you on?
Day oh so late
strangely the sun still shone
what drugs are you on?
Tooled-up Asian boy
has come here to avenge
the cruel, cold killing
of his very best friend
Tooled-up Asian boy
has come here to take revenge
for the cruel, cold killing
of his only friend
Peace through the school
so quiet in the hall
it's a strange sign for one
of what's to come
Tough and hard and pale
oh they may just impale you on railings
oh English boys
it must be wrong
three against one?
Brakes slammed, and
a gun jammed, and
as far as I could tell
brave Asian boy
dealt a blow and fell
I'm just passing through here
on my way to somewhere civilised
and maybe I'll even arrive
maybe I'll even arrive?

 

SING YOUR LIFE

Sing your life
any fool can think of words that rhyme
many others do
why don't you?
do you want to?
Sing your life
just walk right up to the microphone
and name
all the things that you love
all the things that you loathe
sing your life
all the things that you love
all the things that you loathe
oh sing your life
oh sing your life
Others sang your life
but now's your chance to shine
and have the pleasure of
saying what you mean
the rare pleasure of
meaning what you sing
oh, make no mistake, my friend
all of this will end
so sing it now
all the things you love
all the things you loathe
oh sing your life
all the things that you love
all the things that you loathe
oh sing your, oh sing your
Don't leave it all unsaid
somewhere in the wasteland of your head
and make no mistake, my friend
your pointless life will end
but before you go
can you look at the truth?
You have a lovely singing voice
a lovely singing voice
and all of those
who sing on key
they stole the notion
from you and me

 

MUTE WITNESS

Your poor witness
crying so loudly on the floor
oh but she's only trying to tell you
what it was that she saw
she is only trying to tell you
what it was that she saw
Now see her standing on the table
with her small arms flailing
and you feel such compassion
in your soul for
Your poor mute witness
still testing the strength
of our patience
oh but she's only trying to tell you
what it was that she saw
Now see her pointing to the frisbee
with a memory too fuzzy
as her silent words
describe the fright of last night
4 a.m. Norhtside, Clapham Common
who knows what she was doing there?
will she sketch the answer later?
Well, I'll ask her
"now dry your tears, my dear"
Now see her mime in time so nicely
it would all have been so clear
is only she had never volunteered
"your taxi is here, my dear"

 

KING LEER

Your boyfriend, he
went down on one knee
well, could it be
he's only got one knee?
I tried to surprise you
with Vodka
or, Tizer
I can't quite remember
but you didn't thank me
you didn't even thank me
because you never do
Your boyfriend, he
has the gift of the gab
or, could it be
the gift of the grab?
I tried to surprise you
I lay down beside you
and...nothing much happened
and you didn't phone me
you didn't even phone me
because it's not your style
to dial
Your boyfriend, he
displays to me
more than just
a hint of cruelty
I tried to surprise you
I crept up behind you
with a homeless chihuahua
you gushed for an hour
you handed him back and said
"You'll never guess
I'm bored now"

 

FOUND FOUND FOUND

found found found found found found
someone who's worth it
in this murkiness
someone who's never
seeming scheming
found found found found found found
someone who's worth it
in this murkiness
someone who's never
seeming scheming
Oh, but if I'd never found
oh, but if I'd never found
oh, but if I'd never found
I do believe that
the more you give your love
and I do believe that
the more you offer trust
the more you chase
the more you cry
the more you're bound to lose
the more you're bound to lose
Oh, but if I'd never found
oh, but if I'd never found
somebody
who wants to be
who wants to be
with me
all the time

 

DRIVING YOUR GIRLFRIEND HOME

I'm driving
your girlfriend home
and she's saying
how she never chose you
"turn left", she says
so I turn left
and she says
"So how did I end up
so deeply involved in
the very existence
I planned on avoiding?"
and I can't answer
I'm driving
your girlfriend home
and she's laughing
to stop herself crying
"drive on", she says
so I drive on
and she says
"So how did I end up
attached to this person
when his sense of humour
gets gradually worser?"
and I can't tell her
I'm parking
outside her home
and we're shaking hands
goodnight, so politely

 

THE HARSH TRUTH OF THE CAMERA EYE

Churchillian legs
hair barely there
the harsh truth of the camera eye
Your eyes signal pain
because of the strain
of smiling
the harsh truth of the camera eye
telling you all
that you never wnated to know
showing what
you didn't want shown
My so friendly lens
zooms into
"the inner you"
and it tells the harsh truth
and nothing but
Laugh with us all here
that's if you can
then take the pictures home
and screamtelling you all
that you never wanted to know
showing you what
you didn't want shown
This photographer
he must have really had it in for you
"Oh, I don't want
to be judged anymore
I don't wnat to be judged
I would sooner be Loved
I would sooner be
just blindly Loved..."

 

(I'M) THE END OF THE FAMILY LINE

With no complications
fifteen generations
(of mine)
all honouring Nature
until I arrive
(with incredible style)
I'm the end fo the line
the end of the family line
the end of the line
No baby pulled screaming
out into this seething whirl
by chance or whim
(or even love?)
our family tree hacked into decline
and I'm spared the pain
of ever saying
("goodbye")
I'm the end of the line
the end of the family line
the end of the line

 

THERE'S A PLACE IN HELL FOR ME AND MY FRIENDS

There is a place
reserved
for me and my friends
and when we go
we all will go
so you see
I'm never alone
there is a place
with a bit more time
and a few more
gentler words
and looking back
we do forgive
(we had no choice
we always did)
all that we hope
is that when we go
our skin
and our blood
and our bones
don't get in your way
making you ill
the way they did
when we lived
There is a place
a place in hell
reserved
for me and my friends
and if ever I
wanted to cry
then I will
because I can

 

TONY THE PONY

Still drinking on the corner 
Just don't say I didn't warn you 
Always nagging big brother 
He's only looking out for you 
Tony The Pony 
Tony The Pony 
You're still standing on the corner 
Just don't say I didn't warn you 
Old and jealous big brother 
You had your time and you spent it 
Crying 
Now, Tony The Pony 
Tony The Pony 
So, that's what they call you now ? 
When you're free outside 
So cold and hard and in control 
And ... 
There's a free ride on 
Tony The Pony 
Oh, why do you always wanna stop me 
From doing the things in life that make me happy ? 
And when I'm outside with friends, laughing loudly 
Why do you always wanna stop me ? 
Oh, I would never 
I would never 
But you will carry the can for anyone 
The free ride on 
Gullible Tony 
You're drunker quicker 
And you're sicker even quicker 
For something heavy is gonna fall on you 
Oh ... 
And what do they call you now ? 
When you're free outside 
So cold and hard and in control 
And, oh ... been a lark 
There's a free ride on 
Fucked-up Tony 
I will never say I told you so 
Or how I knew that something bad 
Would happen to you 
I don't wanna say I told you so 
Oh, but Tony, I told you so !!! 
I told you so

 

YOU'RE GONNA NEED SOMEONE ON YOUR SIDE

With the world's fate 
Resting on your shoulder 
You're gonna need 
Someone on your side 
You can't do it by yourself 
Any longer 
You're gonna need 
Someone on your side 
Someone kindly told me 
That you'd wasted 
Eight of nine lives
Oh, give yourself a break 
Before you break down 
You're gonna need someone on your side 
And here I am, And here I am 
Well, you don't need 
To look so pleased ! 
Day or night, 
There is no difference 
You're gonna need someone on your side 
Day or night, 
There is no difference 
You're gonna need someone soon 
And here I am, And here I am 
Well, you don't need 
To look so pleased

 

GLAMOROUS GLUE

First day with the jar 
You find 
Everyone lies 
First day with the jar 
You find 
Everyone lies, nobody minds 
Everyone lies 
Where is the man you respect ? 
And where is the woman you love ? 
Where's the woman you love ? 
Third week with the jar
You find 
Everything dies 
We won't vote Conservative 
Because we never have 
Everyone lies, everyone lies 
Where is the man you respect ? 
And where is the woman you love ? 
Where's the woman you love ? 
Everything of worth 
On Earth Is there To share 
I used to dream, and I used to vow 
I wouldn't dream of it now 
We look to Los Angeles 
For the language we use 
London is dead, London is dead, London is dead...
Now I'm too much in love 
I'm too much in love 
I know 
I'll go 
Empty hand 
From the land

 

WE'LL LET YOU KNOW

How sad are we ? 
And how sad have we been ? 
We'll let you know 
We'll let you know 
Oh, but only if - you're really interested 
You wonder how 
We've stayed alive 'till now 
We'll let you know 
We'll let you know 
But only if - you're really interested 
We're all smiles 
Then, honest, I swear, it's the turnstiles 
That make us hostile 
Oh ... 
We will descend 
On anyone unable to defend 
Themselves 
Oh ... 
And the songs we sing 
They're not supposed to mean a thing 
La, la, la, la ... 
Oh ...You're lonely, Oh ... you're lonely, Oh ... 
GET OFF THE ROOF ! Oh ... 
Your Arsenal !
We may seem cold, or 
We may even be 
The most depressing people you've ever known 
At heart, what's left, we sadly know 
That we are the last truly British people you'll ever know 
We are the last truly British people you will ever know 
You'll never never want to know

 

THE NATIONAL FRONT DISCO

David, the wind blows 
The wind blows ... 
Bits of your life away 
Your friends all say ... 
"Where is our boy ? Oh, we've lost our boy" 
But they should know 
Where you've gone 
Because again and again you've explained that 
You're going to ... 
Oh, you're going to ... 
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah 
England for the English ! 
England for the English ! 
David, the winds blow 
The winds blow ...
All of my dreams away 
And I still say : 
"Where is our boy ? Ah, we've lost our boy" 
But I should know 
Why you've gone 
Because again and again you've explained
You've gone to the ... 
National, ah ... 
To the National .. 
There's a country; you don't live there 
But one day you would like to 
And if you show them what you're made of 
Oh, then you might do ... 
But David, we wonder 
We wonder if the thunder 
Is ever really gonna begin 
Begin, begin 
Your mom says : 
"I've lost my boy" 
But she should know 
Why you've gone 
Because again and again you've explained 
You've gone to the : 
National 
To the National 
To the National Front Disco 
Because you want the day to come sooner 
You want the day to come sooner 
You want the day to come sooner 
When you've settled the score 
Oh, the National 
Oh, the National

 

CERTAIN PEOPLE I KNOW

I take the cue from 
Certain people I know 
I use the cue 
And then I 
Hand it on to you 
And when I swing it 
So, it catches his eye ... 
(Weren't you there ? 
- You'd have died !) 
I trust the views of 
Certain people I know 
They look at Danger 
And they 
LAUGH THEIR HEADS OFF 
Their clothes are Imitation 
George the 23rd 
(Don't you find this absurd ?) 
I'd hate to be like 
Certain people I know 
They break their necks 
And can't afford to
Get them fixed 
Ah, they'd sacrifice all 
Of their principles for 
anything cashable 
I do believe it's terrible 
Oh, wo, wo, Ah, ah, ah, ah, Oh, wo, wo...

 

WE HATE IT WHEN OUR FRIENDS BECOME SUCCESSFUL

We hate it when our friends become successful 
We hate it when our friends become successful 
Oh, look at those clothes 
Now look at that face, it's so old 
And such a video ! 
Well, it's really laughable 
Ha, ha, ha ...
We hate it when our friends become successful 
And if they're Northern, that makes it even worse
And if we can destroy them 
You bet your life we will 
Destroy them 
If we can hurt them 
Well, we may as well ... 
It's really laughable 
Ha, ha, ha ... 
You see, it should've been me 
It could've been me 
Everybody knows 
Everybody says so 
They say : 
"Ah, you have loads of songs 
So many songs 
More songs than they'd stand 
Verse 
Chorus 
Middle eight 
Break, fade 
Just listen ..."
La, la-la, la-la

SEASICK, YET STILL DOCKED

I am a poor freezingly cold soul 
So far from where 
I intended to go 
Scavenging through life's very constant lulls 
So far from where I'm determined to go 
Wish I knew the way to reach the one I love
There is no way ... 
Wish I had the charm to attract the one I love 
But you see, I've got no charm 
Mmm...
Tonight I've consumed much more than I can hold 
Oh, this is very clear to you 
And you can tell I have never really loved 
You can tell, by the way, I sleep all day
And all of my life no-one gave me anything 
No-one has ever given me anything 
My love is as sharp as a needle in your eye 
You must be such a fool 
To pass me by

 

I KNOW IT'S GONNA HAPPEN SOMEDAY

My love, wherever you are 
Whatever you are 
Don't lose faith 
I know it's gonna happen someday 
To you 
Please wait ... Please wait ... Oh ... Wait ... 
Don't lose faith 
You say that the day just never arrives 
And it's never seemed so far away 
Still, I know it's gonna happen someday 
To you 
Please wait ... 
Don't lose faith

 

TOMORROW

Tomorrow 
Will it really come ? 
And if it does come 
Will I still be Human ? 
All I ask of you is one thing that you never do 
Would you put your arms around me ? 
(I won't tell anyone) 
Tomorrow 
Does it have to come ?
All I ask of you is one thing that you'll never do 
Would you put your arms around me ? 
(I won't tell anybody) 
Tomorrow 
And what must come before ...
Oh, the pain in my arms 
Oh, the pain in my legs 
Ooh, my shiftless body 
Tomorrow 
It's surely nearer now ? 
You don't think I'll make it 
I never said I wanted to ! 
Well did I ? 
Oh, the pain in my arms 
Oh, the pain in my legs 
Oh, yeah; oh, yeah, No, yeah; no, yeah 
Through my shiftless body 
Tomorrow, Tomorrow 
All I ask of you ... oh ... 
Is : would you tell me that you love me 
Tell me, tell me that you love me, Tell me, tell me that you love me ... 
Ah, I know you don't mean it 
Ah, I know you don't mean it 
Tell me, tell me that you love me, Tell me, tell me that you love me ...

 

YOU'RE THE ONE FOR ME, FATTY

NOVEMBER SPAWNED A MONSTER

Sleep on and dream of Love
because it's the closest you will get to love
poor twisted child, so ugly, so ugly
poor twisted child, oh hug me, oh hug me
one November spawned a monster 
in the shape of this child who later cried
"But Jesus made me, so Jesus save me from
pity, sympathy and people discussing me"
a frame of useless limbs what can make GOOD
all the BAD that's been done?
And if the lights were out
could you even bear
to kiss her full on the mouth (or anywhere?)
poor twisted child, so ugly, so ugly
poor twisted child, oh hug me, oh hug me
one November spawned a monster 
in the shape of this child who must remain
a hostage to kindess and the wheels underneath her
a hostage to kindess and the wheels underneath her
a symbol of where mad, mad lovers
must PAUSE and draw the line
So sleep and dream of love
because it's the closest
you will get to love
that November is a time which I must put OUT of my mind
oh one fine day 
LET IT BE SOON
she won't be rich or beautiful
but she'll be walking your streets
in the clothes that she went out
and chose for herself

 

SEASICK, YET STILL DOCKED

I am a poor freezingly cold soul 
So far from where 
I intended to go 
Scavenging through life's very constant lulls 
So far from where I'm determined to go 
Wish I knew the way to reach the one I love
There is no way ... 
Wish I had the charm to attract the one I love 
But you see, I've got no charm 
Mmm...

THE LOOP

I just wanna say 
I haven't been away 
I'm still right here 
Where I always was 
So one day, if you're bored 
By all means call 
Because you can do 
(But only if you want to) 
I just wanna say 
I haven't been away 
I am still right here 
Where I always was 
So one day, when you're bored 
By all means call 
Because you can do 
But you might not get through

 

SISTER I'M A POET

All over this town 
Yes, a low wind may blow 
And I can see through everybo... 
With no reason 
To hide these words I feel 
And no reason 
To talk about the books I read 
But still I do 
That's 'cause I'm a ... Sister I'm a ... 
All over this town 
Along this way 
Outside the prison gates 
I love the romance of crime 
And I wonder 
Does anybody feel the way I do ? 
And is evil just something you are 
Or something you do ? 
Sister I'm a ... Sister I'm a ... 
All over this town, All over this town 
They pull over 
In their Citroen vans 
Not to shake your hand 
With meths on their breaths 
And you with youth on your side 
A plastic bag stranded at the lights 
This once was me ...
But now I'm a ... Sister I'm a ...
All over this town ... Oh, oh, oh 
All over this town, All over this town, Oh ... 
I still cannot speak French ... I am very lazy

 

JACK THE RIPPER

Oh, you look so tired 
Mouth slack and wide 
Ill-housed and ill-advised 
Your face is as mean 
As your life has been 
Crash into my arms 
I WANT YOU 
You don't agree -
But you don't refuse 
I know you 
And I know a place 
Where no one is likely to pass 
Oh, you don't care if it's late 
And you don't care if you're lost 
And oh, you look so tired 
(But tonight you presumed too much) 
Too much, too much 
And if it's the last 
Thing I ever do 
I'M GONNA GET YOU 
Crash into my arms 
I WANT YOU 
You don't agree -
But you don't refuse 
I know you 
And no one knows a thing about my life 
I can come and go as I please 
And if I want to, I can stay 
Oh, or if I want to, I can leave 
Nobody knows me, Nobody knows me, Nobody knows me Oh, oh...

 

SUCH A LITTLE THING MAKES SUCH A BIG DIFFERENCE

Such a little thing, such a little thing
but the difference it made was grave
there you go
wielding a bicycle chain
oh why won't you change
cange and be nicer?
such a little thing
a gentle tone of kindness
or written words on paper
- can you write?
How I love all of
the very simple things of life
(God's good air)
how I love all of
the very simple things of life
such a little thing
a fumbling politeness
the difference it saved me
wielding a bicycle chain
"I WILL NOT CHANGE AND I WILL NOT BE NICE"
Most people keep their brains between your legs (don't you find?)
Leave me alone - I was only singing, leave me alone because
I was only singing
leave me alone - I was only singing, leave me alone
you have just proved (again)
MOST PEOPLE KEEP THEIR BRAINS BETWEEN THEIR LEGS

 

I KNOW IT'S GONNA HAPPEN SOMEDAY

My love, wherever you are 
Whatever you are 
Don't lose faith 
I know it's gonna happen someday 
To you 
Please wait ... 
Please wait ... 
Oh ... Wait ... 
Don't lose faith 
You say that the day just never arrives 
And it's never seemed so far away 
Still, I know it's gonna happen someday 
To you 
Please wait ... 
Don't lose faith

 

WE'LL LET YOU KNOW

How sad are we ? 
And how sad have we been ? 
We'll let you know, We'll let you know

SUEDHEAD

Why do you come here
why do you hang around
I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry
Why do you come here
when you know it makes
things hard for me
when you know, oh
why do you come?
Why do you telephone?
and why send me silly notes?
I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry
why do you come here
when you know it makes
thing hard for me
when you know, oh
why do you come?
You had to sneak into my room
'just' to read my diary
was it just to see all the things
you knew I'd written about you?
and...so many illustrations
I'm so very sickened
oh, I am so sickened NOW

 

HE KNOWS I'D LOVE TO SEE HIM

He Knows (he knows)
Or, I think he does
because when I lived
in the Arse of the world...
he knows, he knows, he knows I'd love
to see him happy (or as close as is allowed)
because when I lived
in the Arse of the world
he knows, he knows, he knows I'd love
to see him happy (or as close as possible
as close as possible, as close as is allowed)
My name still conjours up deadly deeds
and a bad taste in the mouth
the police - they actually knew me
they said:
"You're just another person in the world
you're just another fool with radical views
you're just another who has maddening views
you want to turn it on its head
by staying in bed!"
I said: "I know I do"

 

YOU'RE GONNA NEED SOMEONE ON YOUR SIDE

With the world's fate 
Resting on your shoulder 
You're gonna need

Someone kindly told me 
That you'd wasted 
Eight of nine lives
Oh, give yourself a break 
Before you break down 
You're gonna need someone on your side 
And here I am, And here I am 
Well, you don't need 
To look so pleased ! 
Day or night, 
There is no difference 
You're gonna need someone on your side 
Day or night, 
There is no difference 
You're gonna need someone soon 
And here I am, And here I am 
Well, you don't need 
To look so pleased

If we can hurt them 
Well, we may as well ... 
It's really laughable 
Ha, ha, ha ... 
You see, it should've been me 
It could've been me 
Everybody knows 
Everybody says so 
They say : 
"Ah, you have loads of songs 
So many songs 
More songs than they'd stand 
Verse 
Chorus 
Middle eight 
Break, fade 
Just listen ..."
La, la-la, la-la

 

NOW MY HEART IS FULL

There's gonna be some trouble 
A whole house will need re-building 
And everyone I love in the house 
Will recline on an analyst's couch quite 
Soon 
Your Father cracks a joke 
And in the usual way 
Empties the room 
Tell all of my friends 
(I don't have too many 
Just some rain-coated lovers' puny brothers)
Dallow, Spicer, Pinkie, Cubitt 
Rush to danger 
Wind up nowhere 
Patric Doonan - raised to wait 
I'm tired again, I've tried again, and 
Now my heart is full 
Now my heart is full 
And I just can't explain 
So I won't even try to
Dallow, Spicer, Pinkie, Cubitt 
Every jammy Stressford poet 
Loafing oafs in all-night chemists 
Loafing oafs in all-night chemists 
Underact - express depression 
Ah, but Bunnie I loved you 
I was tired again 
I've tried again, and 
Now my heart is full 
Now my heart is full 
And I just can't explain 
So I won't even try to 
Could you pass by ? 
Could you pass by ? 
Oh ... 
Now my heart is full 
Now my heart is full 
And I just can't explain 
So ... slow ... 
Slow ... slow ... slow ... slow ... slow ...

 

SPRING-HEELED JIM

Spring-heeled Jim winks an eye 
He'll "do", he'll never be "done to" 
He takes on whoever flew through 
"Well, it's the normal thing to do" ... ah ... 
Spring-heeled Jim lives to love 
Now kissing with his mouth full 
And his eyes on some other fool 
So many women 
His head should be spinning 
Ah, but no ! 
Ah, but no ! 
But no !
Ah, no !
Spring-heeled Jim slurs the words : 
"There's no need to be so knowing
Take life at five times the 
Average speed, like I do" 
Until Jim feels the chill 
"Oh, where did all the time go ?" 
Once always in for the kill 
Now it's too cold 
And he feels too 
old 
Too old
Mmm, old... 
La, la, la, la-la, la ...

 

BILLY BUDD

Say, Billy Budd 
So you think you should ? 
Oh, everyone's laughing 
Say, Billy Budd 
So you think that you should ? 
Everyone's laughing ! 
Since I took up with you 
Things have been bad 
Yeah, but now it's 12 years on 
Now it's 12 years on 
Yes, and I took up with you 
I took my job application 
Into town 
Did you hear ? They turned me down 
Yes, and it's all because of us 
Oh, and what was in our eyes 
Oh, what was in our eyes, yeah 
I said, Billy Budd 
I would happily lose 
Both of my legs 
I would lose both of my legs 
Oh, if it meant you could be free 
Oh, if it meant you could be free 
(Don't leave us in the dark!)

 

HOLD ON TO YOUR FRIENDS

A bond of trust 
Has been abused 
Something of value 
May be lost 
Give up your job 
Squander your cash - be rash 
Just hold on to your friends 
There are more than enough 
To fight and oppose 
Why waste good time 
Fighting the people you like 
Who will fall defending your name 
Oh, don't feel so ashamed 
To have friends 
But now you only call me 
When you're feeling depressed 
When you feel happy I'm 
So far from your mind 
My patience is stretched 
My loyalty vexed 
Oh, you're losing all of your friends 
Hold on to your friends 
Hold on to your friends 
Resist - or move on 
Be mad, be rash 
Smoke and explode 
Sell all of your clothes 
Just bear in mind : 
Oh, there just might come a time 
When you need some friends

 

THE MORE YOU IGNORE ME, THE CLOSER I GET

The more you ignore me 
The closer I get 
You're wasting your time 
The more you ignore me 
The closer I get 
You're wasting your time 
I will be 
In the bar 
With my head 
On the bar 
I am now 
A central part 
Of your mind's landscape 
Whether you care 
Or do not 
Yeah, I've made up your mind 
The more you ignore me 
The closer I get 
You're wasting your time 
The more you ignore me 
The closer I get 
You're wasting your time 
Beware !
I bear more grudges 
Than lonely high court judges 
When you sleep 
I will creep 
Into your thoughts 
Like a bad debt 
That you can't pay 
Take the easy way 
And give in 
Yeah, and let me in 
Oh, let me in 
Oh let me ... 
Oh, let me in 
IT'S WAR 
IT'S WAR 
WAR 
WAR 
Oh, let me in 
Ah, the closer I get 
Ah, you're asking for it 
Ah, the closer I get 
Ooh, the closer I ...

 

WHY DON'T YOU FIND OUT FOR YOURSELF

The sanest days are mad 
Why don't you find out for yourself ? 
Then you'll see the price 
Very closely 
Some men here 
They have a special interest 
In your career 
They wanna help you to grow 
And then syphon all your dough 
Why don't you find out for yourself ? 
Then you'll see the glass 
Hidden in the grass 
You'll never believe me, so 
Why don't you find out for yourself ? 
Sick down to my heart 
That's just the way it goes 
Some men here 
They know the full extent of 
Your distress 
They kneel and pray 
And they say : 
"Long may it last" 
Why don't you find out for yourself ?
Then you'll see the glass 
Hidden in the grass 
Bad scenes come and go 
For which you must allow 
Sick down to my heart 
That's just the way it goes 
Don't rake up my mistakes 
I know exactly what they are 
And ... what do YOU do ? 
Well ... you just SIT THERE 
I've been stabbed in the back 
So many many times 
I don't have any skin 
But that's just the way it goes

 

I AM HATED FOR LOVING

I am hated for loving 
I am hated for loving 
Anonymous call, a poison pen 
A brick in the small of the back again 
I still don't belong 
To anyone - I am mine 
And I am hated for loving 
I am haunted for wanting 
Anonymous call, a poison pen 
A brick in the ... ah ... 
A brick in the small of the back again 
I still don't belong 
To anyone - I am mine 
I am falling 
With no-one to catch me 
I am falling 
And there's still 
No-one to catch me 
Ah .. 
Anonymous call, a poison pen 
A brick in the ... ah ... 
A brick in the small of the back again 
I just don't belong 
To anywhere 
I just don't belong 
Mmm ... 
Ah ...

 

LIFEGUARD SLEEPING, GIRL DROWNING

Always looking for attention 
Always needs to be mentioned 
Who does she 
Think she should be ? 
The shrill cry through darkening air 
Doesn't she know he's 
Had such a busy day ? 
Tell her ... sshhh
Somebody tell her ... sshhh 
Slowest ... 
It was only a test 
But she swam too far 
Against the tide 
She deserves all she gets 
The sky became marked with stars 
As an out-stretched arm slowly 
Disappears 
Hooray 
Oh hooray 
No, oh, oh, woh, there's no movement 
No, oh, hooray 
Oh, hooray 
Please don't worry 
There'll be no fuss 
She was ... nobody's nothing 
(What's your name ?) 
When he awoke 
The sea was calm 
And another day passes like a dream 
There's no ... no way 
(What's your name ?)

 

USED TO BE A SWEET BOY

Used to be a sweet boy 
Holding so tightly 
To Daddy's hand 
But that was all 
In some distant land 
Blazer and tie 
And a big bright healthy smile 
Used to make all 
Of our trials worthwhile 
Used to be a sweet boy 
And I'm not to blame 
Something went wrong 
And I know 
I'm not to blame 
Something went wrong 
Can't be to blame 
Ah ...

 

THE LAZY SUNBATHERS

A world war 
Was announced 
Days ago 
But they didn't know 
The lazy sunbathers 
The lazy sunbathers 
The sun burns through 
To the planet's core 
And it isn't enough 
They want more 
Nothing 
Appears 
To be 
Between the ears of 
The lazy sunbathers 
Too jaded 
To question stagnation 
The sun burns through 
To the planet's core 
And it isn't enough 
They want more 
Religions fall 
Children shelled 
"...Children shelled ? That's all 
Very well, but would you 
Please keep the noise 
Down low ? 
Because you're waking 
The lazy sunbathers ..."
Oh, the lazy sunbathers 
The lazy sunbathers

 

SPEEDWAY

And when you slam 
Down the hammer 
Can you see it in your heart ? 
All of the rumours 
Keeping me grounded 
I never said, I never said that they were 
Completely unfounded 
So when you slam 
Down the hammer 
Can you see it in your heart ? 
Can you delve so low ? 
And when you're standing 
On my fingers 
Can you see it in your heart ? ... ah ... 
And when you try 
To break my spirit 
It won't work 
Because there's nothing left to break 
Anymore 
All of the rumours 
Keeping me grounded 
I never said, I never said that they were 
Completely unfounded 
You won't sleep 
Until the earth that wants me 
Finally has me 
Oh you've done it now 
You won't rest 
Until the hearse that becomes me 
Finally takes me 
Oh you've done it now 
And you won't smile 
Until my loving mouth 
Is shut good and proper 
FOREVER 
All of the rumours 
Keeping me grounded 
I never said, I never said that they were 
Completely unfounded 
And all those lies 
Written lies, twisted lies 
Well, they weren't lies 
They weren't lies 
They weren't lies 
I never said 
I never said 
I could have mentioned your name 
I could have dragged you in 
Guilt by implication 
By association 
I've always been true to you 
In my own strange way 
I've always been true to you 
In my own sick way 
I'll always stay true to you

 

THE TEACHERS ARE AFRAID OF THE PUPILS

There's too many people 
Planning your downfall 
When your spirit's on trial 
These nights can be frightening 
Sleep transports sadness 
To some other mid-brain 
And somebody here 
Will not be here next year 
So you stand by the board 
Full of fear and intention 
And, if you think that they're listening 
Well, you've got to be joking 
Oh, you understand change 
And you think it's essential 
But when your profession 
Is humiliation 
Say the wrong word to our children ...
We'll have you, oh yes, we'll have you 
Lay a hand on our children 
And it's never too late to have you 
Mucus on your collar 
A nail up through the staff chair 
A blade in your soap 
And you cry into your pillow 
To be finished would be a relief 
To be finished would be a relief... 
Say the wrong word to our children ...
We'll have you, oh yes, we'll have you 
Lay a hand on our children 
And it's never too late to have you 
To be finished would be a relief 
To be finished would be a relief...
I'm very glad this thing has come 
Sometimes I'm so glad 
Never bother to play the tunes 
I've seen it coming for dear life

 

READER MEET AUTHOR

You don't know a thing about their lives 
They live where you wouldn't dare to drive
You shake as you think of how they sleep 
But you write as if you are my side-by-side 
Reader, meet Author 
With the hope of hearing sense 
But you may be feeling let down 
By the words of defence 
He says : "No-one ever sees me when I cry"
You don't know a thing about their lives 
Books don't save them, books aren't Stanley knives 
And if a fight broke out here tonight 
You'd be the first away, because you're that type 
And the Year 2000 won't change anyone here 
As each fabled promise flies so fast 
You'll swear it was never there 
Oh, have you ever escaped from a shipwrecked life ? 
So safely with your software; all miles from the front line 
You hear the way their sad voices, and you start to imagine things 
Oh, any excuse to write more lies

 

THE BOY RACER

He's just too good-natured and 
He's got too much money and 
He's got too many girlfriends 
I'm jealous, that's all 
Have you seen him go, though, oh ? 
Have you seen him go, though, oh ? 
Boy racer, Boy racer, oh 
We're gonna kill this pretty thing 
Boy racer, Boy racer, oh 
We're gonna kill this pretty thing

He overspeeds and he never gets pulled over 
Have you seen him go, though, oh ? 
Have you seen him go, though, oh ? 
Boy racer, Boy racer, oh 
We're gonna kill this pretty thing 
Boy racer, Boy racer, oh 
We're gonna kill this pretty thing 
He thinks he got the whole world in his hands 
Stood at the urinal 
He thinks he got the whole world in his hands 
And I'm gonna ... kill him !
Oh, no ! Oh, no ! Oh, no ! Oh, no ! Oh, no !Oh .... 
Boy racer Boy racer, oh 
We're gonna kill this pretty thing...
He's just too good-looking, and, And, and ... 
Boy racer Boy racer, oh 
We're gonna kill this pretty thing...

 

THE OPERATION

You fight with your right hand 
And caress with your left hand 
Everyone I know is sick to death of you 
With a tear that's a mile wide 
In the kite that you're flying 
Everyone I know is sick to death of you 
Ever since 
You don't look the same 
You're just not the same, no way 
You say clever things and 
You never used to 
You don't catch what I'm saying 
When you're deafened to advice 
Everyone here is sick to the 
Back teeth of you 
With a tear that's a mile wide 
In the kite that you're flying 
Everyone here is sick to the 
Tattoo of you 
Ever since 
You don't look the same 
You're just not the same, no way 
You say pleasant things and 
There is no need to
Still, you fight with your right hand 
And caress with your left hand 
Ooh, ooh ... Sad to say ... 
How once I was in love with you 
Sad to say ... 
You don't catch what I'm saying 
When you're deafened to advice 
Ooh, ooh ... Ever since 
You don't look the same 
You're just not the same, no way 
What the hell have 
They stuck into you ?

 

DAGENHAM DAVE

Head in the clouds, and a mouthful of pie 
Head in a blouse, everybody loves him 
I see why 
Dagenham Dave, Dagenham Dave, Oh, Dagenham Dave 
Dagenham Dave, Dagenham Dave, Oh, Dagenham Dave 
"I love Karen, I love Sharon" on the windowscreen 
With never the need to fight or to question a single thing 
Dagenham Dave, Dagenham Dave Oh, Dagenham Dave 
Dagenham Dave, Dagenham Dave Oh, Dagenham Dave ...
He'd love to touch, he's afraid that he might self-combust 
I could say more, but you get the general idea 
Dagenham Dave, Dagenham Dave Dagenham Dave, Dagenham Dave 
Dagenham, Dagenham Dagenham Dave, Dagenham Dave ...
Oh, Dave, oh, Dagenham, dagenham, Oh, Dave, oh, Dave, ...

 

DO YOUR BEST AND DON'T WORRY

Compare the best of their days 
With the worst of your days 
You won't win 
With your standards so high 
And your spirits so low 
At least remember ... 
This is you on a bad day, you on a pale day 
Just do your best and don't ... Don't worry, oh 
The way you hang yourself is oh, so unfair 
See the best of how they look 
Against the worst of how you are
And again, you won't win 
With your standards so high 
And your spirits so low 
At least remember ... 
This is you on a drab day, you in a drab dress 
Just do your best and don't ... Don't worry, oh 
The way you hang yourself is oh, so unfair 
Just do your best and don't ... Don't worry, oh 
The way you watch yourself is oh, so unfair 
Just do your best and don't ... Don't worry, oh 
Do your best and don't ...

SOUTHPAW

You were a boy before you became a man 
I don't see the joy 
And you ran with your pals in the sun 
You turned around and they were gone 
Again ... 
A sick boy should be treated 
So easily defeated 
Oh, I just don't understand 
So you ran with your pals in the sun 
You turned around 
You were alone 
Again ... 
And you ran back to Ma 
Which set the pace for the rest of your days 
Oh, you ran back to Ma 
Which set the pace for the rest of your days 
Oh, you ran back to Ma 
Which set the pace for the rest of your days 
And now, there is something that you should know 
There is something that you should know 
The girl of your dreams is 
Here all alone 
Girl of your dreams is 
Here all alone 
The girl of your dreams is 
Sad and all alone 
The girl of your dreams is 
Here all alone 
There is something that you should know 
There is something that you should know 
Girl of your dreams is 
Here all alone 
The girl of your dreams is 
Sad and is all alone 
The girl of your dreams is 
Sad and is feeling all alone 
Oh, there is something that you should know 
Help me, help me, help me ...

 

MALADJUSTED

I wanna start from 
Before the beginning 
Loot wine, "Be mine, and 
Then let's stay out for the night"
Ride via Parkside 
Semi-perilous lives 
Jeer the lights in the windows 
Of all safe and stable homes 
(But wondering then, well what 
Could peace of mind be like ?)
Anyway do you want to hear 
Our story, or not ? 
As the Fulham Road lights 
Stretch and invite into the night 
From a Stevenage overspill 
We'd kill to live around 
SW6 - with someone like you 
Keep thieves' hours 
With someone like you 
...As long as it slides 
You stalk the house 
In a low-cut blouse : 
"Oh Christ, another stifled 
Friday night !"
And the Fulham Road lights 
Stretch and invite into the night 
Well, I was fifteen 
What could I know ?
When the gulf between 
All the things I need 
And the things I receive 
Is an ancient ocean 
Wide, wild, lost, uncrossed 
Still I maintain there's nothing 
Wrong with you 
You do all that you do 
Because it's all you can do 
Well, I was fifteen 
Where could I go ?
With a soul full of loathing 
For stinging bureaucracy 
Making it anything 
Other than easy 
For working girls like me 
With my hands on my head 
I flop on your bed 
With a head full of dread 
For all I've ever said 
Maladjusted, maladjusted 
Maladjusted maladjusted 
Never to be trusted 
Oh, never to be trusted 
There's nothing wrong with you, oh 
...There's nothing wrong with you

 

ALMA MATTERS

So : the choice I have made 
May seem strange to you 
But who asked you, anyway ? 
It's my life to wreck 
My own way 
You see : to someone, somewhere, oh yeah ... 
Alma matters 
In mind, body and soul 
In part, and in whole 
Because to someone, somewhere, oh yeah ... 
Alma matters 
In mind, body and soul 
In part, and in whole 
So the life I have made 
May seem wrong to you 
But, I've never been surer 
It's my life to ruin 
My own way 
You see : to someone, somewhere, oh yeah ... 
Alma matters 
In mind, body and soul 
In part, and in whole 
Because to someone, somewhere, oh yeah ... 
Alma matters 
In mind, body and soul 
In part, and in whole 
To someone, somewhere, oh yeah ... 
Alma matters 
In mind, body and soul 
Part, and in whole 
So to someone, somewhere, oh yeah ... 
Alma matters 
In mind, body and soul 
Part, and in whole 
To someone, somewhere, oh yeah ... 
Oh yeah ... Oh yeah, oh yeah Oh yeah ...

 

AMBITIOUS OUTSIDERS

Bolt-lock your doors 
Alarm your cars 
And still we move in closer 
Every day 
Top of the list 
Is your smiling kids 
But we'll be smiling too 
So that's OK 
Oh, and by the way 
Thank you, because you're 
Giving, giving, giving 
And we're receiving - 
No, no, we're taking 
Keeping the population down 
Your taxes paid, but 
Police waylaid 
And we knows 
When the school bus 
Comes and goes 
We're on your street, but 
You don't see us 
Or, if you do 
You smile and say Hello 
BUT DON'T UNDERESTIMATE US 
When you are 
Giving, giving, giving 
And we're receiving - 
No, no, we're taking 
Just keeping 
The population down 
You're giving, giving, giving 
Well, it's your own fault 
For reproducing 
We're just keeping 
The population down

 

TROUBLE LOVES ME

Trouble loves me 
Trouble needs me 
Two things 
More than you do 
Or would attempt to 
So, console me 
Otherwise, hold me 
Just when it seems like 
Everything's evened out 
And the balance 
Seems serene 
Trouble loves me 
Walks beside me 
To chide me 
Not to guide me 
It's still much more 
Than you'll do 
So, console me 
Otherwise, hold me 
Just when it seems like 
Everything's evened out 
And the balance seems serene 
See the fool I'll be 
Still running 'round 
On the flesh rampage 
Still running 'round 
Ready with ready-wit 
Still running 'round 
On the flesh rampage 
- At your age ! 
Go to Soho, oh 
Go to waste in 
The wrong arms 
Still running 'round 
Trouble loves me 
Seeks and finds me 
To charlatanize me 
Which is only 
As it should be 
Oh, please fulfill me 
Otherwise, kill me 
Show me a barrel and watch me scrape it 
Faced with the music, as always I'll face it 
In the half-light 
So English, frowning 
Then at midnight I 
Can't get you out of my head 
A disenchanted taste 
Still running 'round 
A disenchanted taste 
Still running 'round

 

PAPA JACK

Papa Jack 
Wants to turn 
Back the clock 
And reach out 
To the kids 
He once had 
Who have flown 
Papa Jack 
In decline 
Feels inclined 
To reach out 
To the kids 
He once had 
Who have flown 
But there was a time 
When the kids reached up 
And Papa Jack just 
Pushed them away 
Looking deep 
In his heart 
Papa Jack 
Doesn't like 
What he sees 
Or the time 
On his hands 
The dying day 
The chilly sun 
Papa Jack 
All alone 
Sings slow 
Grieving and low 
But there was a time 
When the kids reached up 
Now you can't always 
Have it your way 
Papa Jack 
Ah ...

 

AMMUNITION

I know these roads 
Each ridge 
And narrow bridge 
Each cheveron 
Enticing me on 
Each warning sign 
I take in my stride 
I don't need more ammunition 
I've got more than I can spend 
I don't dwell on things I'm missing 
I'm just pleased 
With the things I've found 
I know these roads 
An old hand understands 
Above all, I know what's 
Expected of me now 
Veering cliffwards 
I don't need more ammunition 
I've got more than I can spend 
I don't dwell on things I'm missing 
I'm just pleased 
With the things I've found 
With the things I've found 
With the things I've found 
I've found 
I've been crying 
It comes back on these salient days 
And it stays 
And it says : 
"We've never really been away" 
I don't need more ammunition 
I've got more than I can spend 
I don't think of who I'm missing 
I've got no space and no time 
In my life, anymore 
No space or time 
In my life, anymore 
For Revenge

 

WIDE TO RECEIVE

Download something 
Useful, or useless 
Because I'm lying here 
Wide to receive 
Almost anything 
You'd care to give 
And I don't 
Get along with myself 
And I'm not too keen 
On anyone else 
Turn on, plug in 
Then just walk away 
Unlock, process 
And then just go 
And I've never felt quite so alone 
As I do right now 
I'm lying here 
Wide to receive 
Almost anything 
You'd care to leave 
Wide, wide, wide Wide, wide, wide...

 

ROY'S KEEN

(GO ON !)
He's romancing you 
And chancing his arm 
He'll be here 
Smiling on time 
He's romancing you 
And chancing his arm 
He'll be here 
Smiling on time 
Roy's keen oh Roy's keen 
Roy's keen oh Roy's keen 
We've never seen a 
Keener window-cleaner 
Back up the ladder 
Into each corner 
Dunking the chamois 
Just think of the goodwill 
The ladder's a planet 
Roy is a star, and 
I am a satellite 
(But that's alright) 
He can hold a smile for as long 
As you require (even longer) 
He can hold a smile for as long 
As you require (even longer) 
Roy's keen oh Roy's keen 
Roy's keen oh Roy's keen 
We've never seen a 
Keener window-cleaner 
Back up the ladder 
Into each corner 
Dunking the chamois 
Just think of the goodwill 
The ladder's a planet 
Roy is a star, and 
I am a satellite 
I will be set alight 
Don't say you'll hold it steady 
Then you let it go 
Don't say you'll hold it steady 
Then you let it go Oh ...
You're up the ladder 
Into each corner 
Foot in a bucket 
We trust you to wreck it 
Even when it's under your nose 
Well, you just can't 
See it, can you ? 
Well, it's here 
Right under your nose 
And you just can't 
See it, can you? La la la la ...
Roy's keen, Roy's keen La la la la ...
We've never seen a 
Keener window-cleaner 
Oh ... La la la la ...

 

HE CRIED

I need you 
Simple words 
But words which had never been heard 
By the soul 
Stoned to death 
But still living 
And so he froze where he stood 
And he looked to the ground 
And he cried 
He cried 
Ride our minds 
If you must 
But there's always a line you don't cross 
Time is short 
Don't be cruel 
Oh you don't know the power 
In what you're saying 
Oh ... 
And so he froze where he stood 
And he looked to the ground 
And he cried 
He cried 
People where 
I come from 
They survive without feelings or blood 
I never could 
Was stoned to death 
But I'm still living 
So he froze where he stood 
And he looked to the ground 
And he cried 
He cried 
So he froze 
And he looked, and he looked 
To the ground 
And he cried 
He cried

 

SORROW WILL COME IN THE END

Legalized theft 
Leaves me bereft 
I get it straight in the neck 
(Somehow expecting no less) 
A court of justice 
With no use for Truth 
Lawyer ...liar 
Lawyer ...liar 
You pleaded and squealed 
And you think you've won 
But Sorrow will come 
To you in the end 
And as sure as my words are pure 
I praise the day that brings you pain 
Q.C.'s obsessed with sleaze 
Frantic for Fame 
They're all on the game 
They just use a different name 
You lied 
And you were believed 
By a J.P. senile and vile 
You pleaded and squealed 
And you think you've won 
But Sorrow will come 
To you in the end 
And as sure as my words are pure 
I praise the day that brings you pain 
So don't close your eyes 
Don't close your eyes 
A man who slits throats 
Has time on his hands 
And I'm gonna get you 
So don't close your eyes 
Don't ever close your eyes 
You think you've won 
OH NO

 

SATAN REJECTED MY SOUL

Satan rejected my soul 
He knows my kind 
He won't be dragged down 
He's seen my face around 
He knows Heaven doesn't seem 
To be my home 
So I must find 
Somewhere else to go 
So I must find 
Somewhere else to go 
So, take it - please 
It's free 
You'll never see 
You'll never see 
All the fun in life it's cost me 
Satan rejected my soul 
As low as he goes 
He never quite goes this low 
He's seen my face around 
He knows Heaven doesn't seem 
To be my home 
So I must find 
Somewhere else to go 
So I must find 
Somewhere else to go 
So, take it please 
It's really sly 
Come on, come on, ah Come on, come on, come on 
Take it please, It's really sly 
Come on, come on, ah Come on, come on, come on 
Call me in, Pull me in, call me in 
Come on, come on, oh Come on, come on, come on 
Pull me in, pull me in, Call me in, haul me in, pull me in 
Come on, come on, ah, Come on, come on 
La la la la la, Oh ...

 
 REEL AROUND THE FOUNTAIN

It's time the tale was told
of how you took a child
and you made him old
Reel around the fountain
slap me on the patio
I'll take it now
Fifteen minutes with you
well, I wouldn't say no
people said that you were virtually dead
and they were so wrong
fifteen minutes with you
well, i wouldn't say no
people said that you were easily led
and they were half-right
I dreamt about you last night
and i fell out of bed twice
you can pin and mount me like a butterfly
but take me to the haven of your bed
was something that you never said
two lumps, please
you're the bee's knees
but so am I
Meet me at the fountain
shove me on the patio
I'll take it slowly
Fifteen minutes with you
oh I wouldn't say no
people see no worth in you
oh but I do

 

YOU'VE GOT EVERYTHING NOW

As merry as the days were long
I was right and you were wrong
back at the old grey school
I would win and you would lose
But you've got everything now
and what a terrible mess I've made of my life
No, I've never had a job
because I've never wanted one
I've seen you smile
but I've never really heard you laugh
So who is rich and who is poor?
I cannot say...
You are your mother's only son
and you're a desperate one
But I don't want a lover
I just want to be seen in the back of your car
A friendship sadly lost?
Well, this is true ...and yet, it's false
Did I ever tell you , by the way
I never did like your face
But you've got everything now
and what a terrible mess I've made of my life
No, I've never had a job
because I'm too shy
But I don't want a lover
I just want to be tied to the back of your car.

 

MISERABLE LIE

So, goodbye
please stay with your own kind
and I'll stay with mine
There's something against us
it's not time
So, goodbye
I know I hardly say
how much I love your casual way
but please put your tongue away
a little higher and we're well away
the dark nights are drawing in
and your humour is as black as them
I look at yours, you laugh at mine
and"love" is just a miserable lie
you have destroyed my flower like-life
not once-but twice
you have corrupt my innocent mind
not once-but twice
I know that wind-swept mystical air
it means: I'd like to see your underwear
I recognise that mystical air
it means: I'd like to see your underwear
what do we get for the trouble and pain?
just a rented room in Whalley Range
into the depths of the criminal world
I followed her...
I need advice, I need advice
because nobody ever looks at me twice
I'm just a country-mile behind
the world
I'm just a country mile behind
the whole world
so take me when you go

 

PRETTY GIRLS MAKE GRAVES

Upon the sand,upon the bay
"there is a quick and easy way" you say
before you illustrate
I'd rather state:
"I'm not the man you think I am
I'm not the man you think I am "
And Sorrow's native son
he will not smile for anyone
And pretty girls makes the graves
End of the pier, end of the bay
you tug my arm and say:"Give into lust,
give up to lust, oh heaven knows we'll
soon be dust..."
But I'm not the man you think I am
I'm not the man you think I am
And Sorrow's native son
he will not rise for anyone
And pretty girls make graves
I could have been wild and I could have been free
but Nature played this trick on me
She wants it Now
and she will not wait
but she's too rough
and I'm too delicate
Then on the sand
another man, he takes her hand
and a smile lights up her stupid face
(and well, it would)
I lost my faith in Womanhood
I lost my faith in Womanhood, I lost my faith

 

THE HAND THAT ROCKS THE CRADLE

Please don't cry
the ghost and the storm outside
will not invade this sacred shire
nor infiltrate your mind
my life down I shall lie
if the bogey-man should try
to play tricks on your sacred mind
to tease, torment and tantalise
wavering shadows loom
a piano plays in an empty room
there'll be blood on the cleaver tonight
when darkness lifts and the room is bright
I'll still be by your side
for you are all that matters
and I'll love you till the day I die
there never need to be longing in your eyes
as long as the hand that rocks the cradle is mine
ceiling shadows shimmy by
and when the wardrobe towers like a beast of prey
there's a sadness in your beautiful eyes
you're untouched, unsoiled, wonderous eyes
my life down I shall lie
should restless spirts try
to play tricks on you sacred mind
but whom I never gave a name
I just looked into his wonderous eyes
and said" never never never again"
all too soon I did return
just like a moth to a flame
so rattle my bones all over the stones
because I'm only a beggar-man whom nobody owns
see how words as old as sin
fit me like a glove I'm here and here I'll stay
together we lie, together we pray
there never need be longing in your eyes
as long as the hand that rocks the cradle is mine

 

STILL ILL

I decree today that life
is simply taking and not giving
England is mine and it owes me a living
ask me why, and I'll spit in your eye
ask me why, and I'll spit in your eye
but we cannot cling to the old dreams anymore
no, we cannot cling to the old dreams anymore
Does the body rule the mind
or does the mind rule the body?
I dunno...
Under the iron bridge we kissed
and although I ended up with sore lips
it just wasn't like the old days anymore
no, it wasn't like those days
am I still ill?
Does the body rule the mind
or does the mind rule the body ?
I dunno...
Ask me why, and I'll die
ask me why, and I'll die
and if you must go to work tomorrow
well, if I were you I wouldn't bother
for there are brighter sides to life
and I should know because I've seen them
but not very often...
under the iron bridge we kissed
and although I ended up with sore lips
it just wasn't like the old days anymore
no, it wasn't like those days
am I still ill?

 

HAND IN GLOVE

Hand in glove
the sun shines out of our behinds
no, it's not like any other love
this one is different-because it's us
Hand in glove
we can go wherever we please
and everything depends upon
how near you stand to me
And if the people stare
then the people stare
I really don't know and I really don't care
Hand in glove
the Good People laugh
yes, we may be hidden by rags
but we have something they'll never have
So, hand in glove I stake my claim
I'll fight to the last breath
If they dare touch a hair on your head
I'll fight to the last breath
The Good Life is out there, somewhere
so stay on my arm, you little charmer
But I know my luck too well
and I'll probably never see you again.

 

WHAT DIFFERENCE DOES IT MAKE?

All men have secrets and here is mine
so let it be known
we have been through hell and high tide,
I can surely rely on you?
and yet you start to recoil,
heavy words are so lightly thrown
but still I'd leap in front of a flying bullet for you
So, what difference does it make?
so, what difference does it make?
it makes none
but you have gone
and you must be looking very old tonight
The devil will find work for idle hands to do
I stole and I lied, and why?
because you asked me to!
but now you make feel so ashamed
because I've only got two hands
well, I'm still fond of you
So, what difference does it make?
so, what difference does it make?
it makes none
but you have gone
and your prejudice won't keep you warm tonight
So, no more apologies
no more apologies
I'm too tired
I'm too sick and tired
and I'm feeling very sick and ill today
But I'm still fond of you

 

I DON'T OWE YOU ANYTHING

Bought on stolen wine
a nod was the first step
you know very well
what was coming next
did I really walk all this way
just to hear you say
"oh I don't want to go out tonight"
but you will
for you must
I don't owe you anything
but you owe me something
repay me now
you should never go to them
let them come to you
just like I do
you should not go to them
let them come to you
just like I do
Too freely on your lips
words prematurely said
oh but I know what will make you smile tonight
Life is never kind
life is never kind
oh but I know what will make you smile tonight

 

SUFFER LITTLE CHILDREN

Over the moors,take me to the moors
dig a shallow grave
and I'll lay me down
Lesley-Anne, with your pretty white beads
oh John, you'll never be a man
and you'll never see your home again
oh Manchester, so much to answer for
Edward, see those alluring lights?
tonight will be your very last night
a woman said "I know my son is dead
I'll never rest my hands on his scared head"
Hindley wakes and Hindley says:
"Wherever he has gone, I have gone "
But fresh lilaced moorland fields
cannot hide the stoild stench of death
Hindley wakes and Hindley says:
"Whatever he has done, I have done"
But this is no easy ride
for a child cries
"find me...find me, nothing more
we're on a sullen misty moor
we may be dead and we may be gone
but we will be right by your side
until the day you die
this is no easy ride
we will haunt you when you laugh
yes, you could say we're a team
you might sleep
BUT YOU WILL NEVER DREAM!"
Oh Manchester, so much to answer for
Oh Manchester, so much to answer for
Over the moor, I'm on the moor
the child is on the moor

 

THE HEADMASTER RITUAL

Belligerent ghouls
run Manchester schools
spineless swines
cemented mines
Sir leads the troops
jealous of youth
same old suit since 1962
he does the military two-step
down the nape of my neck
I wanna go home
I don't want to stay
give up education
is a bad mistake
mid-week on the playing fields
Sir thwacks you on the knees
knees you in the groin
elbow in the face
I wanna go home
I don't want to stay
Belligerent ghouls
run Manchester schools
spineless bastards all
Sir leads the troops
jealous of youth
same old jokes since 1902
he does the military two-step
down the nape of my neck
I wanna go home
I don't want to stay
give up life
as a bad mistake
please excuse me from gym
I've got this terrible cold coming on
he grabs and devours
he kicks me in the showers
kicks me in the showers
and he grabs and devours
I wanna go home
I don't want to stay

 

RUSHOLME RUFFIANS

The last night at the fair
by the big wheel generator
a boy is stabbed
and his money is grabbed
and the air hangs heavy like a dulling wine
she is famous
she is funny
an engagement ring
doesn't mean a thing
to a mind consumed by brass(money)
and though I walk home alone
my faith in love is still devout
the last night at the fair
from a seat on a whirling waltzer
her skirt ascends for a watching eye
it's a hideous trait( on her mother's side)
and though I walk home alone
my faith in love is still devout
then someone falls in love
and someone's beaten up
and the senses being dulled are mine

this is the last night of the fair
and the grease in the hair
of a speedway operator
is all a tremulous heart requires
a schoolgirl is denied
she said "How quickly would I die
if I jumped from the top of the parachutes?"

I WANT THE ONE I CAN'T HAVE

On the day that your mentality
catches up with your biology
I want the one I can't have
and it's driving me mad
it's written all over my face
A double-bed
and a stalwart lover, for sure
these are the riches of the poor
A double-bed
and a stalwart lover, for sure
these are the riches of the poor
a tough kid who sometimes swallows nails
raised on Prisoner's Aid
he killed a policeman when he was thirteen
and somehow that really impressed me
it's written all over my face
On the day that your mentality
catches up with your biology
And if you ever need self-validation
just meet me in the alley by the
railway-station
it's written all over my face

 

WHAT SHE SAID

What she said:
"How come someone hasn't noticed
that I'm dead
and decided to bury me
God knows, I'm ready"
What she said was
but then, all the rejection she's had
to pretend to be happy
could only be idiocy
What she said was not for the job or
lover that she never had
What she read
all heady books
she'd sit and prophesise
(it took a tattoed boy from Birkenhead
to really really open her eyes)

THAT JOKE ISN'T FUNNY ANYMORE

Park the car at the side of the road
you should know
time's tide will smother you
and I will too
when you laugh about other people who feel so
very lonely
their only desire is to die
well I'm afraid
it doesn't make me smile
I wish I could laugh
but that joke isn't funny anymore
it's too close to home and it's too near the bone
it's too close to home and it's too near the bone
more than you'll ever know
It was dark as I drove the point home
and on cold leather seats
well, it suddenly struck me
I just might die with a smile on my
face after all
I've seen this happen in other people's lives
and now it's happening in mine

 

NOWHERE FAST

I'd like to drop my trousers to the world
I am a man of means(of slender means)
each household appliance
is like a new science in my town
and if a day came when I felt a natural emotion
I'd get such a shock I'd probably jump in the ocean
and when a train goes by
it's such a sad sound
I'd like to drop my trousers to the Queen
every sensible child will know what this means
the poor and the needy
are selfish and greedy on her terms
and if the day came when I felt a natural emotion
I'd get such a shock I'd probably jump in the ocean
and when a train goes by
it's such a sad song
And when I'm lying in my bed
I think about life
and I think about death
and neither one particularly appeals to me
and if the day came when I felt a natural emotion
I'd get such a shock I'd probably lie
in the middle of the street and die
I'd lie down and die

 

WELL I WONDER

Well I wonder
do you hear me when you sleep?
I hoarsely cry
Well I wonder
do you see me when we pass?
I half-die
Please keep me in mind
please keep me in mind
Gasping-but somehow still alive
this is the fierce last stand of all I am
Gasping-dying-but somehow still alive
this is the final stand of all I am
Please keep me in mind

 

BARBARISM BEGINS AT HOME

Unruly boys
who will not grow up
must be taken in hand
Unruly girls
who will not settle down
they must be taken in hand
A crack on the head
is what you get for not asking
and a crack on the head
is what you get for asking

 

MEAT IS MURDER

Heifer whines could be human cries
closer comes the screaming knife
this beautiful creature must die
this beautiful creature must die
a death for no reason
and death for reason is MURDER
and the flesh you so fancifully fry
is not succulent, tasty or nice
it's death for no reason
and death for no reason is MURDER
and the calf that you carve with a smile
is MURDER
and the turkey you festively slice
is MURDER
do you know how animals die?
kitchen aroma aren't very homely
it's not "comforting," "cheery" or kind
it's sizzling blood and the unholy stench
of MURDER
it's not "natural," "normal" or kind
the fleas you so fancifully fry
as you savour the flavour
of MURDER
NO, NO, NO, IT'S MURDER
NO, NO, NO, IT'S MURDER
who hears when animals cry?

 

THE QUEEN IS DEAD

Farewell to this lands cheerless marches
hemmed in like a boar between arches
her very Lowness with her head in a sling
Im truely sorry-but it sounds like a wonderful thing
dear Charles, dont you ever crave
to appear on the front of the Daily mail
dressed in your Mother's bridal veil?
So, I checked all the registered historical facts
and I was shocked into shame to discover
how Im the 18th pale descendent
of some, old queen or other
has the world changed, or have I changed?
has the world changed, or have I changed?
as some 9-year old tough peddles drugs
(I never even knew what drugs were)
And so, I broke into the Palace
with a sponge and a rusty spanner
she said: "Eh, I know you, and you cannot sing"
I said: "that's nothing -you should hear me play piano"
We can go for a walk where it's quiet and dry
and we can talk about precious things
but when you are tied to your mother's apron
not one talks about castration
We can go for a walk where it's quiet and dry
and we can talk about precious things
like love and law and poverty
these are the things that kill me
We can go for a walk where it's quiet and dry
and we can talk about precious things
but the rain that flattens my hair
theses are the things that kill me
Passed the Pub that saps your body
and the church who'll snatch your money
the Queen is dead, boys
and it's so lonely on a limb
Pass the Pub that wrecks your body
and the church-all they want is your money
the Queen is dead, boys`
you can trust me, boys
life is very long, when you're lonely
life is very long, when you're lonely...

 

FRANKLY MR.SHANKLY

Frankly, Mr Shankly, this position Ive held
it pays my way, but it corrodes my soul
I want to leave you will not miss me
I want to go down in musical history
Frankly, Mr Shankly, Im a sickening wreck
Ive got the 21st Century breathing down my neck
I must move fast, you understand me
I want to go down in celluloid history
Fame, Fame, fatal Fame
it can play hideous tricks on the brain
but still I rather be Famous
than righteous or holy, any day
but sometimes Id feel more fulfilled
making Christmas cards with the mentally ill
I want to Live and I want to Love
I want to catch something that I might be ashamed of
Frankly, Mr Shankly, this position I've held
it pays my way and it corrodes my soul
oh, I didnt realise that you wrote poetry
(I didnt realise you wrote such bloody awful poetry)
Frankly, Mr Shankly, since you ask
you are a flatulent pain the arse
I do not mean to be so rude
but still, I must speck frankly, Mr Shankly

 

I KNOW IT'S ALL OVER

Oh Mother, I can fell the soil falling over my head
and as i climb into an empty bed
Oh well, Enough said
I know it's over-still I cling
I don't know where else I can go
Oh Mother, I can feel the soil falling over my head
see, the sea want s to take me
the knife wants to cut me
do you think you can help me?
Sad veiled bride, please be happy
handsome groom, give her room
loud, loutish lover, treat her kindly
(although she needs you
more than she loves you)
and I know it's over
and it never really began
but in my heart it was so real
and you even spoke to me and said:
"If you're so funny
then why are you on your own tonight?
and if you are so clever
then why are you on your own tonight?
if you're so terribly good looking
then why do you sleep alone tonight?
because tonight is just like any other night
that's why you're on your own tonight
with your triumphs and your charms
while they are in each other's arms.."
It's so easy to laugh
it's so easy to hate
it takes strength to be gentle and kind
It's so easy to laugh
it's so easy to hate
it takes guts to be gentle and kind
love is Natural and Real
but not for you, my love
not tonight my love
love is Natural and Real
but not for such as you and I, my love
Oh Mother, I can fell the soil falling over my head
Oh Mother, I can fell the soil falling over my head...

 

NEVER HAD NO ONE EVER

When you walk without ease
on these
the very streets where you were raised
I had a really bad dream
it lasted 20 years, 7 months, and 27 days
Never had no one ever.

 

CEMETERY GATES

A dreaded sunny day
so I meet you at the cemetry gates
Keats and Yeats are on your side
A dreaded sunny day
so I meet you at the cemetry gates
Keats and Yeats are on your side
while Wilde is on mine
So we go inside and we gravely read the stones
all those people all those lives
where are they now ?
with loves, and hates
and passions just like mine
they were born
and then they lived and then they died
which seems so unfair
and I wantr to crv
You say: "ere thrice the sun hath done salutation to the dawn"
and you claim these words as your own
but Im well-read, have heard them said
a hundred times (maybe less, maybe more)
if you must write prose/poems
the words you use should be your own
dont plagiarise or take "on loans"
there's alweays someone, somewhere
with a big nose, who knows
and who trips you up and laughs
when you fall
You say: "ere long done do does did "
words which could only be your own
you then produce the text
from whence was ripped
(some dizzy whore, 1804)
A dreaded sunny day
so let's go where we're happy
so I meet you at the cemetry gates
Keats and Yeats are on your side
A dreaded sunny day
so let's go where we're wanted
so I meet you at the cemetry gates
Keats and Yeats are on your side
but you lose
because Wilde is on mine

 

BIGMOUTH STRIKES AGAIN

Sweetness, sweetness I was only joking
when I said Id like to smash every tooth
in your head
Sweetness, sweetness I was only joking
when I said by right s you should be
bludgeoned in your bed
and now I know how Joan of Arc felt
now I know how Joan of Arc felt
as the flames roseto her roman nose
and her Walkman stared to melt
Bibmouth, bigmouth
bigmouth strikes again
and Ive got no right to take my place
with the Human race
and now I know how Joan of Arc felt
now I know of Joan of Arc felt
as the flames rose to her roman nose
and her hearing aid started to melt
Bigmouth, bigmouth
bigmouth strikes again

THE BOY WITH A THORN IN HIS SIDE

The boy with the thorn in his side
behind the hatred there lies
a murderous desire for love
how can they look into my eyes
and still they dont believe me
how can they hear me say those words
and still they dont believe me
and if they don't believe me now
will they ever believe me?
and if they don't believe me now
will they ever believe me?
The boy with the thorn in his side
behind the hatred there lies
a plundering desire for love
how can they see the Love in our eyes
and still they don't believe us
and after all this time
they don't want to believe us
and if they dont believe us now
will they ever believe us ?
andd when you want to Live
how do you start ?
where do you go ?
who do you know?

 

VICAR IN A TUTU

I was minding mind business
lifting some lead off
the roof of the Holy Name church
it was worthwhile living a laughable life
just to set my eyes on a blistering sight
of a vicar in a tu-tu
he's not strange
he just wants to live his life this way
a scanty bit of a thing
with a decorative ring
that wouldn't cover the head of a child
as Rose collects the money in the cannister
who comes sliding down the bannister
the vicar in a tu-tu
he's not strange
he just wants to live his life this way
the monkish monsignor
with a head full of plaster
said "my man, get your vile soul dry-cleaned"
as Rose counts the money in the cannister
as natural as rain
he dances again
vicar in a tu-tu
The next day in the pulpit
with Freedom and Ease
combating ignoranca,dust and disease
as Rose counts the money in the cannister
as natural as rain
he dances again
the fabric of a tu-tu
any man could get us to
and I am a living sign.

 

THERE IS A LIGHT THAT NEVER GOES OUT

Take me out tonight
where there's music and there's people
who are young and alive
driving in your car
I never never want to go home
because I havent got one
anymore
take me out tonight
because I want to see people and I
want to see lights
driving in your car
oh please dont drop me home
because it's not my home, it's their
home, and Im welcome no morw
and if a double-decker bus
crashes in to us
to die by your side
such a heavenly way to die
and if a ten ton truck
kills the both of us
to die by your side
the pleasure and the privilege is mine
take me out tonight
oh take me anywhere, I dont care
and in the darken underpass
I thought Oh God, my chance has come at last
(but then a strange fear gripped me and I just couldn't ask)
take me out tonight
take me anywhere, I dont care
just driving in your car
I never never want to go home
because I havent got one
I havent got one.

 

SOME GIRLS ARE BIGGER THAN OTHERS

From the ice-age to the dole-age
there is but one concern
and I have just discover
some girls are bigger than others
some girls are bigger than others
some girls mothers are bigger than
other girls mothers
As Anthony said to Cleopatra
as he opened a crate of ale:
some girls are bigger than others
some girls are bigger than others
some girls mothers are bigger than
other girls mothers.

 

A RUSH AND A PUSH AND AND THE LAND IS OURS

HELLO
I am the ghost of Troubled Joe
hung by his pretty white neck
some eighteen months ago
I travelled to a mystical time zone
but I missed my bed
so I soon came home
they said:
"there's too much caffeine
in your bloodstream
and a lack of real spice
in your life"
I said:
"leave me alone
because I'm alright, dad
just surprised to still
be on my own...."
Ooh, but don't mention love
I'd hate the real strain of the pain again
a rush and a push and the land that
we stand on is ours
it has been before
so it shall be again
and people who are uglier than you and I
they take what they need, and leave
Ooh, but don't mention love
I'd hate the pain and the strain all over again
a rush and a push and the land that
we stand on is ours
it has been before
so why can't it be now?
and people who are weaker than you and I
they take what they want from life
Ooh, but don't mention love
no - just don't mention love!
a rush and a push and the land that
we stand on is ours
your youth may be gone
but you're still a young man
so phone me, phone me, phone me
so phone me, phone me, phone me
Ooh, I think I'm in love...
Urrgh, I think I'm in lerv

 

I STARTED SOMETHING I COULDN'T FINISH

The lanes were silent
with nothing or no one around for miles
I doused our friendly venture
with a hard-faced
three-word gesture
I started something
I forced you into a zone
and you were clearly
never meant to go
hair brushed and parted
typical me, typical me, typical me
I started something
...and now I'm not too sure
I grabbed you by the guilded beams
that's what Tradition means
and I doused another venture
with a gesture
that was...absolutely vile
I started something
forced you to a zone
and you were clearly
never meant to go
hair brushed and parted
typical me, typical me, typical me

...and now I'm not too sure
I grabbed you by the guilded beams
that's what Tradition means
and now eighteen months' hard-labour
seems...fair enough
I started something

DEATH OF A DISCO DANCER

The death of a disco dancer
well, it happens a lot 'round here
and if you think Peace
is a common goal
well, that goes to show
just how little you know
The death of a disco dancer
well, I'd rather not get involved
I never talk to my neighbour
I'd just rather not get involved
Love, peace and harmony?
Love, peace and harmony?
Oh, very nice, very nice, very nice, very nice
...but maybe in the next world.

 

GIRLFRIEND IN A COMA

Girlfriend in a coma, I know
I know - it's serious
Girlfriend in a coma, I know
I know - it's really serious
there wree times when I could
have 'murdered' her
(but, you know, I would hate
anything to happen to her)
NO, I DON'T WANT TO SEE HER
Do you really think
she'll pull through?
Do you really think
she'll pull through?
Girlfriend in a coma, I know

WOULD YOU PLEASE LET ME SEE HER!
Do you really think she'll pull through?
Do you really think she'll pull through?
Let me wisper my last goodbyes
I know - IT'S SERIOUS

 

STOP ME IF YOU'VE HEARD THIS ONE BEFORE

Stop me, stop me,
stop me if you think that you've heard this one before
stop me, stop me
stop me if you think that you've heard this one before
nothing's changed
I still love you, oh I still love you
...only slightly less than I used to
I was delayed, I was way-laid
an emergency stop
I smelt the last ten seconds of life
I crashed down on the crossbar
and the pain was enough to make
a shy, bald buddhist reflect
and plan a mass-murder
who said I'd lied to her?
who said I'd lied because I never
who said I'd lied because I never
I was detained, I was restrained
he broke my spleen
he broke my knees
(and then he really laid into me)
Friday night in Out-patients
who said I'd lied to her?
who said I'd lied - because I never
who said I'd lied - because I never
Oh, so I drank one
or was it four
and when I fell on the floor
...I drank more
stop me, stop me
stop me if you think that you've heard this one before
nothing's changed
I still love you, I still love you
but only slightly
less than I used to

 

LAST NIGHT I DREAMT THAT SOMEBODY LOVED ME

Last night I dreamt
that somebody loved me
no hope - but no harm
just another false alarm
Las night I felt
real arms around me
no hope - no harm
just another false alarm
so, tell me how long
before the last one?
and tell me how long
before the right one?
this story is old - I KNOW
but it goes on
this story is old - I KNOW
but it goes on

 

UNHAPPY BIRTHDAY

I've come to wish you an unhappy birthday
I've come to wish you an unhappy birthday
because you're evil
and you lie
and if you should die
I may feel slightly sad
(but I won't cry)
Loved and lost
and some may say
when usually its Nothing
surely you're happy
it should be this way?
I say "No, I'm gonna kill my dog"
and: "May the lines sag heavy
and deep tonight XXX"

PAINT A VULGAR PICTURE

At the record company meeting
On their hands - a dead star
and ooh, the plans that they weave
and ooh, the sikening greed
At the record company meeting
on their hands - a dead star
the sycophantic slags all say:
"I knew him first, and I knew him well"
Re-issue! Re-package! Re-package!
Re-evaluate the songs
double-pack with a photograph
Extra Track (and a tacky badge)
A-list, playlist
"Please them, please them!"
"Please them! Please them!"
(sadly, THIS was your life)
but you could have said no
if you'd wanted to
you could have said no
if you'd wanted to
BPI, MTV, BBC
"Please them! Please them!"
(sadly this was your life)
but you could have said no
if you'd wanted to
you could have walked away
...couldn't you?
I touched you at the soundcheck
you had no real way of knowing
in my heart I bgged "please, take
me with you...
I don't care where you're going"
But to you I was faceless
I was fawning, I was boring
just a child from those ugly new houses
who could never begin to know
who could never really know
Best of? Most of?
Satiate the need
slip them into different sleeves!
Buy both, and be decieved
climber - new entry, re-entry
World tour! ("media whore")
"Please the Press in Belgium!"
(THIS was your life...)
and when it fails to recoup?
Well, maybe:
You just haven't earned it yet, baby
I walked a pace behind you at the soundcheck
you're just the same as I am
what makes most people feel happy
leads us headlong into harm
so, in my bedroom in those 'ugly new houses'
I dance my legs down to the knees
but me and my 'true love'
we will never meet again...
At the record company meeting
on their hands - at last! - a dead star!
but they cannot taint you in my eyes
no, they cannout touch you now
No, they cannot hurt you my darling
they cannot touch you now
but me and my 'true love'
will never meet again

 

DEATH AT ONE'S ELBOW

Ooh Glenn, don't come to the house tonight
Ooh, Glenn, don't come to the house tonight
because there's somebody here
who really really loves you
stay home
be bored
(it's crap, I KNOW)
Ooh, Glenn, don't come to the house tonight
Ooh, Glen, don't come to the house tonight
because there's somebody here
who'll take a hatchet to your ear
how the frustration renders me
hateful, Glenn!
don't come to the house tonight
don't come to the house tonight
because you'll slip on the
trail of my bespattered remains
and so, that's why
GOODBYE MY LOVE, GOODBYE MY LOVE, GOODBYE MY LOVE...
Belch

 

I WON'T SHARE YOU

I won't share you
I won't share you
with the drive and ambition
and the zeal I feel
this is my time
as the note I wrote
was read, she said
has the Perrier gone
straight to my head
or is life plainly sick and cruel, instead?
"YES!"
No-no-no-no-no-no
I won't share you
I won't share you
with the drive and the dreams inside
this is my time
Life tends to come and go
well, that's OK
just as long as you know
Life tends to come and go
well, that's OK

I won't share you

THE QUEEN IS DEAD

Farewell to this lands cheerless marches
hemmed in like a boar between arches
her very Lowness with her head in a sling
Im truely sorry-but it sounds like a wonderful thing
dear Charles, dont you ever crave
to appear on the front of the Daily mail
dressed in your Mother's bridal veil?
So, I checked all the registered historical facts
and I was shocked into shame to discover
how Im the 18th pale descendent
of some, old queen or other
has the world changed, or have I changed?
has the world changed, or have I changed?
as some 9-year old tough peddles drugs
(I never even knew what drugs were)
And so, I broke into the Palace
with a sponge and a rusty spanner
she said: "Eh, I know you, and you cannot sing"
I said: "that's nothing -you should hear me play piano"
We can go for a walk where it's quiet and dry
and we can talk about precious things
but when you are tied to your mother's apron
not one talks about castration
We can go for a walk where it's quiet and dry
and we can talk about precious things
like love and law and poverty
these are the things that kill me
We can go for a walk where it's quiet and dry
and we can talk about precious things
but the rain that flattens my hair
theses are the things that kill me
Passed the Pub that saps your body
and the church who'll snatch your money
the Queen is dead, boys
and it's so lonely on a limb
Pass the Pub that wrecks your body
and the church-all they want is your money
the Queen is dead, boys`
you can trust me, boys
life is very long, when you're lonely
life is very long, when you're lonely...

 

PANIC

Panic on the streets of London
Panic on the streets of Birmingham
I wonder to myself
Could life ever be sane again
on the Leeds side-streets that you slip down
I wonder to myself
Hopes may rise on the Grasmeres
But Honey Pie, you're not safe here
So you run down
To the safety of the town
But there's Panic on the streets of Carlisle
Dublin, Dundee, Humberside
I wonder to myself
Burn down the Disco
Hang the blessed D.J.
Because the music that they constantly play
IT SAYS NOTHING TO ME ABOUT MY LIFE
Hang the blessed D.J.
Because the music they constantly play
On the Leeds side-streets that you slip down
On the provincial towns that you jog 'round
Hang the D.J.,. Hang the D.J.,.Hang the D.J...

ASK

Shyness is nice, but
Shyness can stop you
From doing all the things in life
That you'd like to
So, if there's something you'd like to try
ASK ME-I WON'T SAY "NO"-HOW COULD I?
Coyness is nice, but ,
Coyness can stop you
from saying all the things in
life that you want to
If there's something that you'd like to try
ASK ME-I WON'TSAY"NO"-HOW COULD I?
Spending warm, Summer days indoors
Writing fringhtening verse
To a buck-toothed girl in Luxembourg
ASK ME, ASK ME ,ASK ME, ASK ME, ASK ME ,ASK ME
Because if it's not Love
Then it's the Bomb
That will bring us together
Nature is a language-can't you read?
Nature is a language-can't you read?
ASK ME, ASK ME ,ASK ME, ASK ME, ASK ME ,ASK ME
Because if it's not Love
Then it's the Bomb
That will bring us together

 

MARIE'S THE NAME (HIS LATEST FLAME) / RUSHOLME RUFFIANS

Very old friend 
Came by today 
As he was telling everyone in town 
Of all the love that he'd just found 
And Marie's the name (of his latest flame) 
Talked and talked 
And I heard him say 
That she had the longest blackest hair 
Prettiest green eyes anywhere 
And Marie's the name (of his latest flame) 
The last night of the fair 
By the big wheel generator 
A boy is stabbed 
His money is grabbed 
And the air hangs heavy like a dulling wine 
She is Famous 
She is Funny 
An engagement ring 
Doesn't mean a thing 
To a mind consumed by brass (money), oh 
The last night of the fair 
From a seat on a whirling waltzer 
Her skirt ascends for a watching eye 
It's a hideous trait (on her mother's side)
From a seat on a whirling waltzer 
Her skirt ascends for a watching eye 
A hideous trait (on her mother's side) 
Then someone falls in love 
Someone's beaten up 
Someone's beaten up 
And the senses being dulled are mine 
And someone falls in love 
Someone's beaten up 
And the senses being dulled are mine 
This is the last night of the fair 
And the grease in the hair 
Of a speedway operator 
Is all a tremulous heart requires 
A schoolgirl is denied 
She said : "How quickly would I die 
If I jumped from the top of the parachutes ?"
This is the last night of the fair 
And the grease in the hair 
Of a speedway operator 
Is all a tremulous heart requires 
A schoolgirl is denied 
She said : "How quickly would I die 
Oh, if I jumped from the top of the parachutes ?"
...Oh, walk home alone 
I might walk home alone 
But my faith in love is still devout

 

THE BOY WITH THE THORN IN HIS SIDE

The boy with the thorn in his side
behind the hatred there lies
a murderous desire for love
how can they look into my eyes
and still they dont believe me

and if they don't believe me now
will they ever believe me?

RUBBER RING / WHAT SHE SAID

Yeah! What she says : 
"How come someone hasn't noticed 
That I'm dead 
And decided to bury me ? 
God knows, I'm ready !"
La-la-la ... 
What she said was sad 
But then, all the rejection she's had 
To pretend to be happy 
Could only be idiocy 
La-la-la ... 
What she said was not for the job or 
Lover that she never had 
No no no ... 
What she read 
All heady books 
She'd sit and prophesise 
(It took a tattooed boy from 
Birkenhead 
To really really open her eyes)

IS IT REALLY SO STRANGE?

I left the North 
I travelled South 
I found a tiny house 
And I can't help the way I feel 
Oh yes, you can kick me 
And you can punch me 
And you can break my face 
But you won't change the way I feel 
'Cause I love you, Oh ... 
And is it really so strange ? 
Oh, is it really so strange ? 
Oh, is it really so, really so strange ? 
I say NO, you say YES 
(and you will change your mind) 
I left the South 
I travelled North 
I got confused - I killed a horse 
I can't help the way I feel 
Oh yes, you can punch me 
And you can butt me 
And you can break my spine 
But you won't change the way I feel 
'Cause I love you, Oh ... 
And is it really so strange ? 
Oh, is it really so strange ? 
Oh, is it really so, really so strange ? 
I say NO, you say YES 
(But you will change your mind) 
I left the North again 
I travelled South again 
And I got confused - I killed a nun 
I CAN'T HELP THE WAY I FEEL 
(I lost my bag in Newport Pagnell) 
Why is the last mile the hardest mile ? 
My throat was dry, with the sun in my eyes 
And I realised, I realised 
I could never 
I could never, never, never, go back home again

 

CEMETERY GATES

so I meet you at the cemetry gates
Keats and Yeats are on your side
A dreaded sunny day
so I meet you at the cemetry gates
Keats and Yeats are on your side
while Wilde is on mine
So we go inside and we gravely read the stones
all those people all those lives
where are they now ?
with loves, and hates
and passions just like mine
they were born
and then they lived and then they died
which seems so unfair
and I wantr to crv
You say: "ere thrice the sun hath done salutation to the dawn"
and you claim these words as your own
but Im well-read, have heard them said
a hundred times (maybe less, maybe more)
if you must write prose/poems
the words you use should be your own
dont plagiarise or take "on loans"
there's alweays someone, somewhere
with a big nose, who knows
and who trips you up and laughs
when you fall
You say: "ere long done do does did "
words which could only be your own
you then produce the text
from whence was ripped
(some dizzy whore, 1804)
A dreaded sunny day
so let's go where we're happy
so I meet you at the cemetry gates
Keats and Yeats are on your side
A dreaded sunny day
so let's go where we're wanted
so I meet you at the cemetry gates
Keats and Yeats are on your side
but you lose
because Wilde is on mine

 

LONDON

Smoke
Lingers 'round your fingers
Train
Heave on - to Euston
Do you think you've made
The right decision this time?
You left
Your tired family grieving
And you think they're sad because you're leaving
But didn't you see the Jealousy in the eyes
Of the ones who had to stay behind?
And do you think you've made
The right decision thins time?
You left
Your girlfriend on the platform
With thei really ragged notion that you'll return
But she knows
That when he goes
He really goes
So do you think you've made
The right decision this time?

 

I KNOW IT'S OVER

I can feel the soil falling over my head 
And as I climb into an empty bed 
Oh well. Enough said. 
I know it's over - still I cling 
I don't know where else I can go 
Over ... 
Oh Mother, I can feel the soil falling over my head 
See, the sea wants to take me 
The knife wants to cut me 
Do you think you can help me ? 
Sad veiled bride, please be happy 
Handsome groom, give her room 
Loud, loutish lover, treat her kindly 
(Though she needs you 
More than she loves you) 
And I know it's over - still I cling 
I don't know where else I can go 
Over, it's over, it's over, it's over 
It's over, la ... 
I know it's over 
And it never really began 
But in my heart it was so real
And you even spoke to me, and said : 
"If you're so funny 
Then why are you on your own tonight ? 
And if you're so clever 
Then why are you on your own tonight ? 
I know ... 
'Cause tonight - it's just like any other night 
That's why you're on your own tonight 
Your triumphs and your charms 
While they're in each other's arms..."
It's so easy to laugh 
It's so easy to hate 
It takes strength to be gentle and kind 
Over, over, over, over 
It's so easy to laugh 
It's so easy to hate 
It takes guts to be gentle and kind 
Over, over 
Love is Natural and Real 
But not for you, my love 
Not tonight, my love 
Love is Natural and Real 
But not for such as you and I, my love 
Oh Mother, I can feel the soil falling over my head...
Oh Mother, I can feel the soil fall over, fall over my head 
Oh Mother, I can feel the ... fall over my ... , Oh ...

 

THE DRAIZE TRAIN

A vastly superior version of the instrumental B-side, acting as a peace 
offering to Marr (Morrissey chose the tracks for the compilation, 
and of course, receives no royalties on this track).

 

STILL ILL

I decree today that life
is simply taking and not giving
England is mine and it owes me a living
ask me why, and I'll spit in your eye
ask me why, and I'll spit in your eye
but we cannot cling to the old dreams anymore
no, we cannot cling to the old dreams anymore
Does the body rule the mind
or does the mind rule the body?
I dunno...
Under the iron bridge we kissed
and although I ended up with sore lips
it just wasn't like the old days anymore
no, it wasn't like those days
am I still ill?
Does the body rule the mind
or does the mind rule the body ?
I dunno...
Ask me why, and I'll die
ask me why, and I'll die
and if you must go to work tomorrow
well, if I were you I wouldn't bother
for there are brighter sides to life
and I should know because I've seen them
but not very often...
under the iron bridge we kissed
and although I ended up with sore lips
it just wasn't like the old days anymore
no, it wasn't like those days
am I still ill?

 

BIGMOUTH STRIKES AGAIN

Sweetness, sweetness I was only joking
when I said Id like to smash every tooth
in your head
Sweetness, sweetness I was only joking
when I said by right s you should be
bludgeoned in your bed
and now I know how Joan of Arc felt
now I know how Joan of Arc felt
as the flames roseto her roman nose
and her Walkman stared to melt
Bibmouth, bigmouth
bigmouth strikes again
and Ive got no right to take my place
with the Human race
and now I know how Joan of Arc felt
now I know of Joan of Arc felt
as the flames rose to her roman nose
and her hearing aid started to melt
Bigmouth, bigmouth
bigmouth strikes again
and Ive got no right to take my place
with the Human race

 
ALSATIAN COUSTIN

Were you and he Lovers?
and would you say so if you were?
on a forecourt
on a Friday
passing my way
Were you and he Lovers?
and if you were, then say that you were!
on a groundsheet
under canvas
with your tent-flap
open wide
A note upon his desk:
"P.S. Bring Me Home And Have Me!"
Leather elbows on a tweed coat
- Oh! -
Is THAT the best you can do?
So came his reply:
"...but on the desk is where I want you!"
So I ask (even though I know):
were you and he Lovers?

 

LITTLE MAN, WHAT NOW?

An afternoon nostalgia
television show
you spoke in silhouette
(but they couldn't name you)
although the panel were
very polite to you
but I remembered you
from Friday nights 1969
ATV - you murdered every line
too old to be a child star
too young to take leads
four seasons passed
and they AXED you
nervously juvenile
(WON'T SMILE!)
What became of you?
did that swift eclipse torture you?
a star at eighteen
and then-suddenly gone
down to a few lines
in the back page of a teenage annual
oh but I remembered you
I looked up to you

 

EVERYDAY IS LIKE SUNDAY

Trudging slowly over wet sand
back to the bench
where your clothes were stolen
this is the coastal town
that they forgot to close down
Armageddon - come Armageddon!
Come Armageddon! Come!
Everyday is like Sunday
everyday is silent and grey
Hide on the promenade
scratch out a postcard
"how I dearly with I was not here"
in the seaside town
...that they forgot to bomb
Come! Come! Come - nuclear bomb!
Everyday is like Sunday
everyday is silent and grey
Trudging back over pebbles and sand
and a strange dust lands on your hands
(and on your face)
Everyday is like Sunday
"Win Yourself A Cheap Tray"
share some greased tea with me
everyday is silent and grey

 

BENGALI IN PLATFORMS

No no no
he does not want to depress you
oh no no no no no
he only wants to impress you
Bengali in platform
she only wants to embrace your culture
and to be your friend forever
Bengali, Bengali
oh shelve your Western plans
and understand that life is hard enough when you belong here
A silver-studded rim that glistens
and an ankle-star that...blinds me
a lemon sole so very high
which only reminds me, to tell you
so I break the news gently
I break the news to you gently
"Shelve your plans"
Bengali, Bengali
its the touchy march of time
that blinds you
don't blame me
don't hate me
just because I'm the one to tell you
that life is hard enough when you belong here
life is hard enough when you belong here
shelve your western plans
life is hard enough when you belong here

 

ANGEL, ANGEL, DOWN WE GO TOGETHER

Angel, Angel
don't take your life tonight
I know they take
and that they take in turn
and they give you nothing real
for yourself in return
and when they've used you
and they've broken you
and wasted all your money
and cast your shell aside
and when they've bought you
and they've sold you
and they've billed you for the pleasure
and they've made your parents cry
I will be here
BELIEVE ME
I will be here
...believe me
Angel, don't take your life
some people have got no pride
they do not understand
the Urgency of life
but I love you more than life
I love you more than life
I love you more than life
I love you more than life

 

LALE NIGHT, MAUDLIN STREET

The last night on Maudlin Street
goodbye house
goodbye stairs
I was born here
I was raised here, and
...I took some stick here
love at first sight
may sound trite
but it's true, you know
I could list the details
of everything you ever wore
or said, or how you stood that day
and as we spend the last night
on Maudlin Street, I say
"goodbye house-forever!"
I never stole a happy hour
around here
Where the world's ugliest boy
became what you see
here I am - the ugliest man
Its the last night on Maudlin Street
and truly I do love you
oh, truly I do love you
When I sleep with that picture of
you framed beside my bed
oh, it's childish and it's silly
but I think it's you in my room
by the bed (...yes, I told you it was silly...)
and I know
I took strange pills
but I never meant to hurt you
oh truly I love you
I came home late one night
everyone had gone to bed
nobody stays up for you
when you have sixteen stitches
all around your head
the last buss I missed to Maudlin Street
so, he drove me home in the Van
complaining: "Women only like me for my mind..."
don't leave your torch behind
power-cuts ahead
as we crept through the park
but no I cannot steal a pair of jeans
off a clothesline for you
but you...without clothes
oh I could not keep a straight face
me - without clothes?
well a nation turns its back and gags...
I'm packed
I am moving house
a half-life disappears today
every slag waves me on
(secretly wishing me gone
well, I will be soon
oh - I will be soon)
There were bad times on Maudlin Street
when they took you away in a police car
dear Inspector - don't you know?
don't you care?
don't you know - about Love?
Your gran died
and your mother died
on Maudlin Street
in pain and ashamed
with never time to say
those special things
I took the keys from Maudlin Street
well, it's only bricks and mortar!
and...truly I do love you
wherever you are
wherever you are

 

SUEDHEAD

Why do you come here
why do you hang around
I'm so sorry
I'm so sorry
Why do you come here
when you know it makes
things hard for me
when you know, oh
why do you come?
Why do you telephone?
and why send me silly notes?
I'm so sorry
I'm so sorry
why do you come here
when you know it makes
thing hard for me
when you know, oh
why do you come?
You had to sneak into my room
'just' to read my diary
was it just to see all the things
you knew I'd written about you?
and...so many illustrations
I'm so very sickened
oh, I am so sickened NOW

 

BREAK UP THE FAMILY

The strange logic of your clumsiest line
stayed emblazoned on my mind
break up the family
and lets begin to live our lives
I went to see all my friends tonight
it wasn't Youth, it wasn't even Life
born Old, sadly wise
resigned (well, we were)
to ending our lives
I'm so glad to grow older
to move away from those awful times
I want to see all my friends tonight
Yes you found love but you weren't
at peace with your life
home late, full of Hate
despise the ties that bind
oh I'm so glad to grow older
to move away from those younger years
now I'm in love for the first time
and I don't feel bad
Let me see all my old friends
let me put my arm around them
because I really do love them
now, does that sound mad?
Captain of games, solid framed
I stood on the touchline
hailstones, driven home
in his car - no breaks? I don't mind
I'm just so glad to grow older
to move away from those darker years
I'm in love for the first time
and I don't feel bad
so wish me luck my friends
goodbye

 

HAIRDRESSER ON FIRE

Here is London
here is London
is it home of the free,
or what?
can you squeeze me
into an empty page of your diary
and psychologically save me
I've got faith in you
I sense the power
in the fingers
within an hour the power
can totally destroy me
or it could same my life
here is London
'home of the brash, outrageous
and free'
you are repressed
but you're remarkably dressed
is it Real?
but you're far to busy
busy scissors
busy clippers
hair dresser on fire
all around Sloane Square
and you're far too busy
to see me
"busy,busy"
hairdresser on fire
was a client over-cautious
he made you nervous
and when he said
"I'm gonna sue you"
I really felt for you
so can you squeeze me
into an empty page of your diary
and supernaturally change me
CHANGE ME, CHANGE ME

 

THE ORDINARY BOYS

Ordinary boys, happy knowing nothing
happy being no one, but themselves
Ordinary girls, supermarket clothes
who think it's very clever to be cruel to you
for you were so different
you stood all alone
and you knew
that it had to be so
avoiding ordinary boys
happy going nowhere, just around here
in their rattling cars
and ordinary girls
never seeing further
than the cold, small streets
that trap them
but you were so different
you had to say no
when those empty fools
tried to change you, and claim you
for the lair of their ordinary world
where they feel so lucky
so lucky, so lucky
with their lives laid out before them
they're so lucky, so lucky
so lucky, so lucky

 

I DON'T MIND IF YOU FORGET ME

I don't mind
I don't mind if you forget me
having learned my lesson
I never left an impression on anyone
so now you send me your hardened 'regards'
when once you'd send me 'love'
sincerely I must tell you
your mild 'best wishes'
they make me suspicious
but I don't mind
I don't mind if you forget me
having learned my lesson
I never left
an impression on anyone
the pressure to change, to move on
was strange
and very strong
so this is why I tell you
I really do understand
BYE BYE
I don't mind if you forget me
no no no no no no no
REJECTION IS ONE THING
BUT REJECTION FROM A FOOL
IS CRUEL
REJECTION IS ONE THING
BUT REJECTION FROM A FOOL
IS CRUEL
and I don't mind if you forget me
I don't mind if your forget me

 

DIAL-A-CLICHE

Further into the fog I fall
well, I was just
following you!
when you said:
"Do as I do and scrap your fey ways"
(dial-a-cliche)
"grow up, be a man, and close your mealy-mouth!"
(dial-a-cliche)
But the person underneath
where does he go?
does he slide by the wayside?
or...does he just die?
when you find that you've organized
your feelings, for people
who didn't like you then
and certainly don't like you now
yet still you say:
"Do as I do and scrap your fey ways"
(dial-a-cliche)
"grow up, be a man, and close your mealy-mouth!"
(dial-a-cliche)
"the Safe way is the only way!
there's always time to change, son!"
yes well I've changed
but I'm in pain!
dial-a-chiche

 

MARGARET ON THE GUILLOTINE

The kind people
have a wonderful dream
Margaret on the guillotine
because people like you
make me feel so tired
when will you die?
when will you die?
when will you die?
when will you die?
when will you die?
because people like you
make me feel so old inside
please die
and kind people
do not shelter this dream
make it real
make the dream real
make the dream real
make it real

 

OUR FRANK

Our frank and open
deep conversations
they get me nowhere
they bring me down, so
give it a rest, won't you?
give me a cigarette
God give me patience
just no more conversation
Give us a drink
and make it quick
or else I'm gonna be sick
sick all over
your frankly vulgar
red pullover
now see how the colours blend
Our frank and open
deep conversations
they get me nowhere
they bring me down, so
give it a rest, won't you?
now will you just give over
the world may be ending
but look, I'm only human
Give us a drink
and make it quick
or else I'm gonna be sick
all over
your frankly vulgar
red pullover
now see how the two colours blend
Won't somebody stop me
from thinking all the time
about everything
so deeply
so bleakly

 

ASIAN RUT

Day oh so late
strangely the sun still shone
oh Asian boy
what are you on?
Day oh so late
strangely the sun still shone
what drugs are you on?
Tooled-up Asian boy
has come here to avenge
the cruel, cold killing
of his very best friend
Tooled-up Asian boy
has come here to take revenge
for the cruel, cold killing
of his only friend
Peace through the school
so quiet in the hall
it's a strange sign for one
of what's to come
Tough and hard and pale
oh they may just impale you on railings
oh English boys
it must be wrong
three against one?
Brakes slammed, and
a gun jammed, and
as far as I could tell
brave Asian boy
dealt a blow and fell
I'm just passing through here
on my way to somewhere civilised
and maybe I'll even arrive
maybe I'll even arrive?

 

SING YOUR LIFE

Sing your life
any fool can think of words that rhyme
many others do
why don't you?
do you want to?
Sing your life
just walk right up to the microphone
and name
all the things that you love
all the things that you loathe
sing your life
all the things that you love
all the things that you loathe
oh sing your life
oh sing your life
Others sang your life
but now's your chance to shine
and have the pleasure of
saying what you mean
the rare pleasure of
meaning what you sing
oh, make no mistake, my friend
all of this will end
so sing it now
all the things you love
all the things you loathe
oh sing your life
all the things that you love
all the things that you loathe
oh sing your, oh sing your
Don't leave it all unsaid
somewhere in the wasteland of your head
and make no mistake, my friend
your pointless life will end
but before you go
can you look at the truth?
You have a lovely singing voice
a lovely singing voice
and all of those
who sing on key
they stole the notion
from you and me

 

MUTE WITNESS

Your poor witness
crying so loudly on the floor
oh but she's only trying to tell you
what it was that she saw
she is only trying to tell you
what it was that she saw
Now see her standing on the table
with her small arms flailing
and you feel such compassion
in your soul for
Your poor mute witness
still testing the strength
of our patience
oh but she's only trying to tell you
what it was that she saw
Now see her pointing to the frisbee
with a memory too fuzzy
as her silent words
describe the fright of last night
4 a.m. Norhtside, Clapham Common
who knows what she was doing there?
will she sketch the answer later?
Well, I'll ask her
"now dry your tears, my dear"
Now see her mime in time so nicely
it would all have been so clear
is only she had never volunteered
"your taxi is here, my dear"

 

KING LEER

Your boyfriend, he
went down on one knee
well, could it be
he's only got one knee?
I tried to surprise you
with Vodka
or, Tizer
I can't quite remember
but you didn't thank me
you didn't even thank me
because you never do
Your boyfriend, he
has the gift of the gab
or, could it be
the gift of the grab?
I tried to surprise you
I lay down beside you
and...nothing much happened
and you didn't phone me
you didn't even phone me
because it's not your style
to dial
Your boyfriend, he
displays to me
more than just
a hint of cruelty
I tried to surprise you
I crept up behind you
with a homeless chihuahua
you gushed for an hour
you handed him back and said
"You'll never guess
I'm bored now"

 

FOUND FOUND FOUND

found found found found found found
someone who's worth it
in this murkiness
someone who's never
seeming scheming
found found found found found found
someone who's worth it
in this murkiness
someone who's never
seeming scheming
Oh, but if I'd never found
oh, but if I'd never found
oh, but if I'd never found
I do believe that
the more you give your love
and I do believe that
the more you offer trust
the more you chase
the more you cry
the more you're bound to lose
the more you're bound to lose
Oh, but if I'd never found
oh, but if I'd never found
somebody
who wants to be
who wants to be
with me
all the time

 

DRIVING YOUR GIRLFRIEND HOME

I'm driving
your girlfriend home
and she's saying
how she never chose you
"turn left", she says
so I turn left
and she says
"So how did I end up
so deeply involved in
the very existence
I planned on avoiding?"
and I can't answer
I'm driving
your girlfriend home
and she's laughing
to stop herself crying
"drive on", she says
so I drive on
and she says
"So how did I end up
attached to this person
when his sense of humour
gets gradually worser?"
and I can't tell her
I'm parking
outside her home
and we're shaking hands
goodnight, so politely

 

THE HARSH TRUTH OF THE CAMERA EYE

Churchillian legs
hair barely there
the harsh truth of the camera eye
Your eyes signal pain
because of the strain
of smiling
the harsh truth of the camera eye
telling you all
that you never wnated to know
showing what
you didn't want shown
My so friendly lens
zooms into
"the inner you"
and it tells the harsh truth
and nothing but
Laugh with us all here
that's if you can
then take the pictures home
and screamtelling you all
that you never wanted to know
showing you what
you didn't want shown
This photographer
he must have really had it in for you
"Oh, I don't want
to be judged anymore
I don't wnat to be judged
I would sooner be Loved
I would sooner be
just blindly Loved..."

 

(I'M) THE END OF THE FAMILY LINE

With no complications
fifteen generations
(of mine)
all honouring Nature
until I arrive
(with incredible style)
I'm the end fo the line
the end of the family line
the end of the line
No baby pulled screaming
out into this seething whirl
by chance or whim
(or even love?)
our family tree hacked into decline
and I'm spared the pain
of ever saying
("goodbye")
I'm the end of the line
the end of the family line
the end of the line

 

THERE'S A PLACE IN HELL FOR ME AND MY FRIENDS

There is a place
reserved
for me and my friends
and when we go
we all will go
so you see
I'm never alone
there is a place
with a bit more time
and a few more
gentler words
and looking back
we do forgive
(we had no choice
we always did)
all that we hope
is that when we go
our skin
and our blood
and our bones
don't get in your way
making you ill
the way they did
when we lived
There is a place
a place in hell
reserved
for me and my friends
and if ever I
wanted to cry
then I will
because I can

 

TONY THE PONY

Still drinking on the corner 
Just don't say I didn't warn you 
Always nagging big brother 
He's only looking out for you 
Tony The Pony 
Tony The Pony 
You're still standing on the corner 
Just don't say I didn't warn you 
Old and jealous big brother 
You had your time and you spent it 
Crying 
Now, Tony The Pony 
Tony The Pony 
So, that's what they call you now ? 
When you're free outside 
So cold and hard and in control 
And ... 
There's a free ride on 
Tony The Pony 
Oh, why do you always wanna stop me 
From doing the things in life that make me happy ? 
And when I'm outside with friends, laughing loudly 
Why do you always wanna stop me ? 
Oh, I would never 
I would never 
But you will carry the can for anyone 
The free ride on 
Gullible Tony 
You're drunker quicker 
And you're sicker even quicker 
For something heavy is gonna fall on you 
Oh ... 
And what do they call you now ? 
When you're free outside 
So cold and hard and in control 
And, oh ... been a lark 
There's a free ride on 
Fucked-up Tony 
I will never say I told you so 
Or how I knew that something bad 
Would happen to you 
I don't wanna say I told you so 
Oh, but Tony, I told you so !!! 
I told you so

 

YOU'RE GONNA NEED SOMEONE ON YOUR SIDE

With the world's fate 
Resting on your shoulder 
You're gonna need 
Someone on your side 
You can't do it by yourself 
Any longer 
You're gonna need 
Someone on your side 
Someone kindly told me 
That you'd wasted 
Eight of nine lives
Oh, give yourself a break 
Before you break down 
You're gonna need someone on your side 
And here I am, And here I am 
Well, you don't need 
To look so pleased ! 
Day or night, 
There is no difference 
You're gonna need someone on your side 
Day or night, 
There is no difference 
You're gonna need someone soon 
And here I am, And here I am 
Well, you don't need 
To look so pleased

 

GLAMOROUS GLUE

First day with the jar 
You find 
Everyone lies 
First day with the jar 
You find 
Everyone lies, nobody minds 
Everyone lies 
Where is the man you respect ? 
And where is the woman you love ? 
Where's the woman you love ? 
Third week with the jar
You find 
Everything dies 
We won't vote Conservative 
Because we never have 
Everyone lies, everyone lies 
Where is the man you respect ? 
And where is the woman you love ? 
Where's the woman you love ? 
Everything of worth 
On Earth Is there To share 
I used to dream, and I used to vow 
I wouldn't dream of it now 
We look to Los Angeles 
For the language we use 
London is dead, London is dead, London is dead...
Now I'm too much in love 
I'm too much in love 
I know 
I'll go 
Empty hand 
From the land

 

WE'LL LET YOU KNOW

How sad are we ? 
And how sad have we been ? 
We'll let you know 
We'll let you know 
Oh, but only if - you're really interested 
You wonder how 
We've stayed alive 'till now 
We'll let you know 
We'll let you know 
But only if - you're really interested 
We're all smiles 
Then, honest, I swear, it's the turnstiles 
That make us hostile 
Oh ... 
We will descend 
On anyone unable to defend 
Themselves 
Oh ... 
And the songs we sing 
They're not supposed to mean a thing 
La, la, la, la ... 
Oh ...You're lonely, Oh ... you're lonely, Oh ... 
GET OFF THE ROOF ! Oh ... 
Your Arsenal !
We may seem cold, or 
We may even be 
The most depressing people you've ever known 
At heart, what's left, we sadly know 
That we are the last truly British people you'll ever know 
We are the last truly British people you will ever know 
You'll never never want to know

 

THE NATIONAL FRONT DISCO

David, the wind blows 
The wind blows ... 
Bits of your life away 
Your friends all say ... 
"Where is our boy ? Oh, we've lost our boy" 
But they should know 
Where you've gone 
Because again and again you've explained that 
You're going to ... 
Oh, you're going to ... 
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah 
England for the English ! 
England for the English ! 
David, the winds blow 
The winds blow ...
All of my dreams away 
And I still say : 
"Where is our boy ? Ah, we've lost our boy" 
But I should know 
Why you've gone 
Because again and again you've explained
You've gone to the ... 
National, ah ... 
To the National .. 
There's a country; you don't live there 
But one day you would like to 
And if you show them what you're made of 
Oh, then you might do ... 
But David, we wonder 
We wonder if the thunder 
Is ever really gonna begin 
Begin, begin 
Your mom says : 
"I've lost my boy" 
But she should know 
Why you've gone 
Because again and again you've explained 
You've gone to the :

I trust the views of 
Certain people I know 
They look at Danger 
And they 
LAUGH THEIR HEADS OFF 
Their clothes are Imitation 
George the 23rd 
(Don't you find this absurd ?) 
I'd hate to be like 
Certain people I know 
They break their necks 
And can't afford to
Get them fixed 
Ah, they'd sacrifice all 
Of their principles for 
anything cashable 
I do believe it's terrible 
Oh, wo, wo, Ah, ah, ah, ah, Oh, wo, wo...

You bet your life we will 
Destroy them 
If we can hurt them

I am a poor freezingly cold soul 
So far from where 
I intended to go 
Scavenging through life's very constant lulls 
So far from where I'm determined to go 
Wish I knew the way to reach the one I love
There is no way ... 
Wish I had the charm to attract the one I love 
But you see, I've got no charm 
Mmm...
Tonight I've consumed much more than I can hold 
Oh, this is very clear to you 
And you can tell I have never really loved 
You can tell, by the way, I sleep all day
And all of my life no-one gave me anything 
No-one has ever given me anything 
My love is as sharp as a needle in your eye 
You must be such a fool 
To pass me by

 

I KNOW IT'S GONNA HAPPEN SOMEDAY

My love, wherever you are 
Whatever you are 
Don't lose faith 
I know it's gonna happen someday 
To you 
Please wait ... Please wait ... Oh ... Wait ... 
Don't lose faith 
You say that the day just never arrives 
And it's never seemed so far away 
Still, I know it's gonna happen someday 
To you 
Please wait ... 
Don't lose faith

Tomorrow 
Does it have to come ?
All I ask of you is one thing that you'll never do 
Would you put your arms around me ? 
(I won't tell anybody) 
Tomorrow 
And what must come before ...
Oh, the pain in my arms 
Oh, the pain in my legs 
Ooh, my shiftless body 
Tomorrow 
It's surely nearer now ? 
You don't think I'll make it 
I never said I wanted to ! 
Well did I ? 
Oh, the pain in my arms 
Oh, the pain in my legs 
Oh, yeah; oh, yeah, No, yeah; no, yeah 
Through my shiftless body 
Tomorrow, Tomorrow 
All I ask of you ... oh ... 
Is : would you tell me that you love me 
Tell me, tell me that you love me, Tell me, tell me that you love me ... 
Ah, I know you don't mean it 
Ah, I know you don't mean it 
Tell me, tell me that you love me, Tell me, tell me that you love me ...

NOVEMBER SPAWNED A MONSTER

Sleep on and dream of Love
because it's the closest you will get to love
poor twisted child, so ugly, so ugly
poor twisted child, oh hug me, oh hug me
one November spawned a monster 
in the shape of this child who later cried
"But Jesus made me, so Jesus save me from
pity, sympathy and people discussing me"
a frame of useless limbs what can make GOOD
all the BAD that's been done?
And if the lights were out
could you even bear
to kiss her full on the mouth (or anywhere?)
poor twisted child, so ugly, so ugly
poor twisted child, oh hug me, oh hug me
one November spawned a monster 
in the shape of this child who must remain
a hostage to kindess and the wheels underneath her
a hostage to kindess and the wheels underneath her
a symbol of where mad, mad lovers
must PAUSE and draw the line
So sleep and dream of love
because it's the closest
you will get to love
that November is a time which I must put OUT of my mind
oh one fine day 
LET IT BE SOON
she won't be rich or beautiful
but she'll be walking your streets
in the clothes that she went out
and chose for herself

 

SEASICK, YET STILL DOCKED

I am a poor freezingly cold soul 
So far from where 
I intended to go 
Scavenging through life's very constant lulls 
So far from where I'm determined to go 
Wish I knew the way to reach the one I love
There is no way ... 
Wish I had the charm to attract the one I love 
But you see, I've got no charm 
Mmm...

Oh, this is very clear to you

You must be such a fool

THE LOOP

I just wanna say 
I haven't been away 
I'm still right here 
Where I always was 
So one day, if you're bored 
By all means call 
Because you can do 
(But only if you want to) 
I just wanna say 
I haven't been away 
I am still right here 
Where I always was 
So one day, when you're bored 
By all means call

SISTER I'M A POET

All over this town 
Yes, a low wind may blow 
And I can see through everybo... 
With no reason 
To hide these words I feel 
And no reason 
To talk about the books I read 
But still I do 
That's 'cause I'm a ... Sister I'm a ... 
All over this town 
Along this way 
Outside the prison gates 
I love the romance of crime 
And I wonder 
Does anybody feel the way I do ? 
And is evil just something you are 
Or something you do ? 
Sister I'm a ... Sister I'm a ... 
All over this town, All over this town 
They pull over 
In their Citroen vans 
Not to shake your hand 
With meths on their breaths 
And you with youth on your side 
A plastic bag stranded at the lights 
This once was me ...
But now I'm a ... Sister I'm a ...
All over this town ... Oh, oh, oh 
All over this town, All over this town, Oh ... 
I still cannot speak French ... I am very lazy

 

JACK THE RIPPER

Oh, you look so tired 
Mouth slack and wide 
Ill-housed and ill-advised 
Your face is as mean 
As your life has been 
Crash into my arms 
I WANT YOU 
You don't agree -
But you don't refuse 
I know you 
And I know a place 
Where no one is likely to pass 
Oh, you don't care if it's late 
And you don't care if you're lost 
And oh, you look so tired 
(But tonight you presumed too much) 
Too much, too much 
And if it's the last 
Thing I ever do 
I'M GONNA GET YOU 
Crash into my arms 
I WANT YOU 
You don't agree -
But you don't refuse 
I know you 
And no one knows a thing about my life 
I can come and go as I please 
And if I want to, I can stay 
Oh, or if I want to, I can leave 
Nobody knows me, Nobody knows me, Nobody knows me Oh, oh...

 

SUCH A LITTLE THING MAKES SUCH A BIG DIFFERENCE

Such a little thing, such a little thing
but the difference it made was grave
there you go
wielding a bicycle chain
oh why won't you change
cange and be nicer?
such a little thing
a gentle tone of kindness
or written words on paper
- can you write?
How I love all of
the very simple things of life
(God's good air)
how I love all of
the very simple things of life
such a little thing
a fumbling politeness
the difference it saved me
wielding a bicycle chain
"I WILL NOT CHANGE AND I WILL NOT BE NICE"
Most people keep their brains between your legs (don't you find?)
Leave me alone - I was only singing, leave me alone because
I was only singing
leave me alone - I was only singing, leave me alone
you have just proved (again)
MOST PEOPLE KEEP THEIR BRAINS BETWEEN THEIR LEGS

 

I KNOW IT'S GONNA HAPPEN SOMEDAY

My love, wherever you are 
Whatever you are 
Don't lose faith 
I know it's gonna happen someday 
To you

Oh ... Wait ... 
Don't lose faith 
You say that the day just never arrives 
And it's never seemed so far away 
Still, I know it's gonna happen someday 
To you 
Please wait ... 
Don't lose faith

why do you hang around

Why do you telephone?
and why send me silly notes?
I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry
why do you come here

You had to sneak into my room
'just' to read my diary
was it just to see all the things
you knew I'd written about you?
and...so many illustrations
I'm so very sickened
oh, I am so sickened NOW

and a bad taste in the mouth
the police - they actually knew me
they said:
"You're just another person in the world
you're just another fool with radical views
you're just another who has maddening views
you want to turn it on its head
by staying in bed!"

There's gonna be some trouble 
A whole house will need re-building 
And everyone I love in the house 
Will recline on an analyst's couch quite 
Soon 
Your Father cracks a joke 
And in the usual way 
Empties the room 
Tell all of my friends 
(I don't have too many 
Just some rain-coated lovers' puny brothers)
Dallow, Spicer, Pinkie, Cubitt 
Rush to danger 
Wind up nowhere 
Patric Doonan - raised to wait 
I'm tired again, I've tried again, and 
Now my heart is full 
Now my heart is full 
And I just can't explain 
So I won't even try to

Loafing oafs in all-night chemists

Underact - express depression 
Ah, but Bunnie I loved you 
I was tired again 
I've tried again, and 
Now my heart is full

And I just can't explain 
So I won't even try to 
Could you pass by ? 
Could you pass by ? 
Oh ...

Slow ... slow ... slow ... slow ... slow ...

 

SPRING-HEELED JIM

Spring-heeled Jim winks an eye 
He'll "do", he'll never be "done to" 
He takes on whoever flew through 
"Well, it's the normal thing to do" ... ah ... 
Spring-heeled Jim lives to love 
Now kissing with his mouth full 
And his eyes on some other fool 
So many women 
His head should be spinning 
Ah, but no ! 
Ah, but no ! 
But no !
Ah, no !
Spring-heeled Jim slurs the words : 
"There's no need to be so knowing
Take life at five times the 
Average speed, like I do" 
Until Jim feels the chill 
"Oh, where did all the time go ?" 
Once always in for the kill 
Now it's too cold 
And he feels too 
old 
Too old
Mmm, old... 
La, la, la, la-la, la ...

Into town 
Did you hear ? They turned me down 
Yes, and it's all because of us 
Oh, and what was in our eyes 
Oh, what was in our eyes, yeah 
I said, Billy Budd 
I would happily lose 
Both of my legs 
I would lose both of my legs 
Oh, if it meant you could be free 
Oh, if it meant you could be free 
(Don't leave us in the dark!)

 

HOLD ON TO YOUR FRIENDS

A bond of trust 
Has been abused 
Something of value 
May be lost 
Give up your job 
Squander your cash - be rash 
Just hold on to your friends 
There are more than enough 
To fight and oppose 
Why waste good time 
Fighting the people you like 
Who will fall defending your name 
Oh, don't feel so ashamed 
To have friends 
But now you only call me 
When you're feeling depressed 
When you feel happy I'm 
So far from your mind 
My patience is stretched 
My loyalty vexed 
Oh, you're losing all of your friends 
Hold on to your friends 
Hold on to your friends 
Resist - or move on 
Be mad, be rash 
Smoke and explode 
Sell all of your clothes 
Just bear in mind : 
Oh, there just might come a time 
When you need some friends

 

THE MORE YOU IGNORE ME, THE CLOSER I GET

The more you ignore me 
The closer I get 
You're wasting your time 
The more you ignore me 
The closer I get 
You're wasting your time 
I will be 
In the bar 
With my head 
On the bar 
I am now 
A central part 
Of your mind's landscape 
Whether you care 
Or do not 
Yeah, I've made up your mind 
The more you ignore me 
The closer I get 
You're wasting your time 
The more you ignore me 
The closer I get 
You're wasting your time 
Beware !
I bear more grudges 
Than lonely high court judges 
When you sleep 
I will creep 
Into your thoughts 
Like a bad debt 
That you can't pay 
Take the easy way 
And give in 
Yeah, and let me in 
Oh, let me in 
Oh let me ... 
Oh, let me in 
IT'S WAR 
IT'S WAR 
WAR 
WAR 
Oh, let me in 
Ah, the closer I get 
Ah, you're asking for it 
Ah, the closer I get 
Ooh, the closer I ...

 

WHY DON'T YOU FIND OUT FOR YOURSELF

The sanest days are mad 
Why don't you find out for yourself ? 
Then you'll see the price 
Very closely 
Some men here 
They have a special interest 
In your career 
They wanna help you to grow 
And then syphon all your dough 
Why don't you find out for yourself ? 
Then you'll see the glass 
Hidden in the grass 
You'll never believe me, so 
Why don't you find out for yourself ? 
Sick down to my heart 
That's just the way it goes 
Some men here 
They know the full extent of 
Your distress 
They kneel and pray 
And they say : 
"Long may it last" 
Why don't you find out for yourself ?
Then you'll see the glass 
Hidden in the grass 
Bad scenes come and go 
For which you must allow 
Sick down to my heart 
That's just the way it goes 
Don't rake up my mistakes 
I know exactly what they are 
And ... what do YOU do ? 
Well ... you just SIT THERE 
I've been stabbed in the back 
So many many times 
I don't have any skin 
But that's just the way it goes

 

I AM HATED FOR LOVING

I am hated for loving 
I am hated for loving 
Anonymous call, a poison pen 
A brick in the small of the back again 
I still don't belong 
To anyone - I am mine 
And I am hated for loving 
I am haunted for wanting 
Anonymous call, a poison pen 
A brick in the ... ah ... 
A brick in the small of the back again 
I still don't belong 
To anyone - I am mine 
I am falling 
With no-one to catch me 
I am falling 
And there's still 
No-one to catch me 
Ah .. 
Anonymous call, a poison pen 
A brick in the ... ah ... 
A brick in the small of the back again 
I just don't belong 
To anywhere 
I just don't belong 
Mmm ... 
Ah ...

 

LIFEGUARD SLEEPING, GIRL DROWNING

Always looking for attention 
Always needs to be mentioned 
Who does she 
Think she should be ? 
The shrill cry through darkening air 
Doesn't she know he's 
Had such a busy day ? 
Tell her ... sshhh
Somebody tell her ... sshhh 
Slowest ... 
It was only a test 
But she swam too far 
Against the tide 
She deserves all she gets 
The sky became marked with stars 
As an out-stretched arm slowly 
Disappears 
Hooray 
Oh hooray 
No, oh, oh, woh, there's no movement 
No, oh, hooray 
Oh, hooray 
Please don't worry 
There'll be no fuss 
She was ... nobody's nothing 
(What's your name ?) 
When he awoke 
The sea was calm 
And another day passes like a dream 
There's no ... no way 
(What's your name ?)

 

USED TO BE A SWEET BOY

Used to be a sweet boy 
Holding so tightly 
To Daddy's hand 
But that was all 
In some distant land 
Blazer and tie 
And a big bright healthy smile 
Used to make all 
Of our trials worthwhile 
Used to be a sweet boy 
And I'm not to blame 
Something went wrong 
And I know 
I'm not to blame 
Something went wrong 
Can't be to blame 
Ah ...

 

THE LAZY SUNBATHERS

A world war 
Was announced 
Days ago 
But they didn't know 
The lazy sunbathers 
The lazy sunbathers 
The sun burns through 
To the planet's core 
And it isn't enough 
They want more 
Nothing 
Appears 
To be 
Between the ears of 
The lazy sunbathers 
Too jaded 
To question stagnation 
The sun burns through 
To the planet's core 
And it isn't enough 
They want more 
Religions fall 
Children shelled 
"...Children shelled ? That's all 
Very well, but would you 
Please keep the noise 
Down low ? 
Because you're waking 
The lazy sunbathers ..."
Oh, the lazy sunbathers 
The lazy sunbathers

 

SPEEDWAY

And when you slam 
Down the hammer 
Can you see it in your heart ? 
All of the rumours 
Keeping me grounded 
I never said, I never said that they were 
Completely unfounded 
So when you slam 
Down the hammer 
Can you see it in your heart ? 
Can you delve so low ? 
And when you're standing 
On my fingers 
Can you see it in your heart ? ... ah ... 
And when you try 
To break my spirit 
It won't work 
Because there's nothing left to break 
Anymore 
All of the rumours 
Keeping me grounded 
I never said, I never said that they were 
Completely unfounded 
You won't sleep 
Until the earth that wants me 
Finally has me 
Oh you've done it now 
You won't rest 
Until the hearse that becomes me 
Finally takes me 
Oh you've done it now 
And you won't smile 
Until my loving mouth 
Is shut good and proper 
FOREVER 
All of the rumours 
Keeping me grounded 
I never said, I never said that they were 
Completely unfounded 
And all those lies 
Written lies, twisted lies 
Well, they weren't lies 
They weren't lies 
They weren't lies 
I never said 
I never said 
I could have mentioned your name 
I could have dragged you in 
Guilt by implication 
By association 
I've always been true to you 
In my own strange way 
I've always been true to you 
In my own sick way 
I'll always stay true to you

 

THE TEACHERS ARE AFRAID OF THE PUPILS

There's too many people 
Planning your downfall 
When your spirit's on trial 
These nights can be frightening 
Sleep transports sadness 
To some other mid-brain 
And somebody here 
Will not be here next year 
So you stand by the board 
Full of fear and intention 
And, if you think that they're listening 
Well, you've got to be joking 
Oh, you understand change 
And you think it's essential 
But when your profession 
Is humiliation 
Say the wrong word to our children ...
We'll have you, oh yes, we'll have you 
Lay a hand on our children 
And it's never too late to have you 
Mucus on your collar 
A nail up through the staff chair 
A blade in your soap 
And you cry into your pillow 
To be finished would be a relief 
To be finished would be a relief... 
Say the wrong word to our children ...
We'll have you, oh yes, we'll have you 
Lay a hand on our children 
And it's never too late to have you 
To be finished would be a relief 
To be finished would be a relief...
I'm very glad this thing has come 
Sometimes I'm so glad 
Never bother to play the tunes 
I've seen it coming for dear life

 

READER MEET AUTHOR

You don't know a thing about their lives 
They live where you wouldn't dare to drive
You shake as you think of how they sleep 
But you write as if you are my side-by-side 
Reader, meet Author 
With the hope of hearing sense 
But you may be feeling let down 
By the words of defence 
He says : "No-one ever sees me when I cry"
You don't know a thing about their lives 
Books don't save them, books aren't Stanley knives 
And if a fight broke out here tonight 
You'd be the first away, because you're that type 
And the Year 2000 won't change anyone here 
As each fabled promise flies so fast 
You'll swear it was never there 
Oh, have you ever escaped from a shipwrecked life ? 
So safely with your software; all miles from the front line 
You hear the way their sad voices, and you start to imagine things 
Oh, any excuse to write more lies

 

THE BOY RACER

He's just too good-natured and 
He's got too much money and 
He's got too many girlfriends 
I'm jealous, that's all 
Have you seen him go, though, oh ? 
Have you seen him go, though, oh ? 
Boy racer, Boy racer, oh 
We're gonna kill this pretty thing 
Boy racer, Boy racer, oh 
We're gonna kill this pretty thing

Boy racer, Boy racer, oh 
We're gonna kill this pretty thing 
Boy racer, Boy racer, oh 
We're gonna kill this pretty thing 
He thinks he got the whole world in his hands 
Stood at the urinal 
He thinks he got the whole world in his hands 
And I'm gonna ... kill him !
Oh, no ! Oh, no ! Oh, no ! Oh, no ! Oh, no !Oh .... 
Boy racer Boy racer, oh 
We're gonna kill this pretty thing...
He's just too good-looking, and, And, and ... 
Boy racer Boy racer, oh 
We're gonna kill this pretty thing...

 

THE OPERATION

You fight with your right hand 
And caress with your left hand 
Everyone I know is sick to death of you 
With a tear that's a mile wide 
In the kite that you're flying 
Everyone I know is sick to death of you 
Ever since 
You don't look the same 
You're just not the same, no way 
You say clever things and 
You never used to 
You don't catch what I'm saying 
When you're deafened to advice 
Everyone here is sick to the 
Back teeth of you 
With a tear that's a mile wide 
In the kite that you're flying 
Everyone here is sick to the 
Tattoo of you 
Ever since 
You don't look the same 
You're just not the same, no way 
You say pleasant things and 
There is no need to
Still, you fight with your right hand 
And caress with your left hand 
Ooh, ooh ... Sad to say ... 
How once I was in love with you 
Sad to say ... 
You don't catch what I'm saying 
When you're deafened to advice 
Ooh, ooh ... Ever since 
You don't look the same 
You're just not the same, no way 
What the hell have 
They stuck into you ?

 

DAGENHAM DAVE

Head in the clouds, and a mouthful of pie 
Head in a blouse, everybody loves him 
I see why 
Dagenham Dave, Dagenham Dave, Oh, Dagenham Dave 
Dagenham Dave, Dagenham Dave, Oh, Dagenham Dave 
"I love Karen, I love Sharon" on the windowscreen 
With never the need to fight or to question a single thing 
Dagenham Dave, Dagenham Dave Oh, Dagenham Dave 
Dagenham Dave, Dagenham Dave Oh, Dagenham Dave ...
He'd love to touch, he's afraid that he might self-combust 
I could say more, but you get the general idea 
Dagenham Dave, Dagenham Dave Dagenham Dave, Dagenham Dave 
Dagenham, Dagenham Dagenham Dave, Dagenham Dave ...
Oh, Dave, oh, Dagenham, dagenham, Oh, Dave, oh, Dave, ...

 

DO YOUR BEST AND DON'T WORRY

Compare the best of their days 
With the worst of your days 
You won't win 
With your standards so high 
And your spirits so low 
At least remember ... 
This is you on a bad day, you on a pale day 
Just do your best and don't ... Don't worry, oh 
The way you hang yourself is oh, so unfair 
See the best of how they look 
Against the worst of how you are
And again, you won't win 
With your standards so high 
And your spirits so low 
At least remember ... 
This is you on a drab day, you in a drab dress 
Just do your best and don't ... Don't worry, oh 
The way you hang yourself is oh, so unfair 
Just do your best and don't ... Don't worry, oh 
The way you watch yourself is oh, so unfair 
Just do your best and don't ... Don't worry, oh 
Do your best and don't ...

SOUTHPAW

You were a boy before you became a man 
I don't see the joy 
And you ran with your pals in the sun 
You turned around and they were gone 
Again ... 
A sick boy should be treated 
So easily defeated 
Oh, I just don't understand 
So you ran with your pals in the sun 
You turned around 
You were alone 
Again ... 
And you ran back to Ma 
Which set the pace for the rest of your days 
Oh, you ran back to Ma 
Which set the pace for the rest of your days 
Oh, you ran back to Ma 
Which set the pace for the rest of your days 
And now, there is something that you should know 
There is something that you should know 
The girl of your dreams is 
Here all alone 
Girl of your dreams is 
Here all alone 
The girl of your dreams is 
Sad and all alone 
The girl of your dreams is 
Here all alone 
There is something that you should know 
There is something that you should know 
Girl of your dreams is 
Here all alone 
The girl of your dreams is 
Sad and is all alone 
The girl of your dreams is 
Sad and is feeling all alone 
Oh, there is something that you should know 
Help me, help me, help me ...

 

MALADJUSTED

I wanna start from 
Before the beginning 
Loot wine, "Be mine, and 
Then let's stay out for the night"
Ride via Parkside 
Semi-perilous lives 
Jeer the lights in the windows 
Of all safe and stable homes 
(But wondering then, well what 
Could peace of mind be like ?)
Anyway do you want to hear 
Our story, or not ? 
As the Fulham Road lights 
Stretch and invite into the night 
From a Stevenage overspill 
We'd kill to live around 
SW6 - with someone like you 
Keep thieves' hours 
With someone like you 
...As long as it slides 
You stalk the house 
In a low-cut blouse : 
"Oh Christ, another stifled 
Friday night !"
And the Fulham Road lights 
Stretch and invite into the night 
Well, I was fifteen 
What could I know ?
When the gulf between 
All the things I need 
And the things I receive 
Is an ancient ocean 
Wide, wild, lost, uncrossed 
Still I maintain there's nothing 
Wrong with you 
You do all that you do 
Because it's all you can do 
Well, I was fifteen 
Where could I go ?
With a soul full of loathing 
For stinging bureaucracy 
Making it anything 
Other than easy 
For working girls like me 
With my hands on my head 
I flop on your bed 
With a head full of dread 
For all I've ever said 
Maladjusted, maladjusted 
Maladjusted maladjusted 
Never to be trusted 
Oh, never to be trusted 
There's nothing wrong with you, oh 
...There's nothing wrong with you

 

ALMA MATTERS

So : the choice I have made 
May seem strange to you 
But who asked you, anyway ? 
It's my life to wreck 
My own way 
You see : to someone, somewhere, oh yeah ... 
Alma matters 
In mind, body and soul 
In part, and in whole 
Because to someone, somewhere, oh yeah ... 
Alma matters 
In mind, body and soul 
In part, and in whole 
So the life I have made 
May seem wrong to you 
But, I've never been surer 
It's my life to ruin 
My own way 
You see : to someone, somewhere, oh yeah ... 
Alma matters 
In mind, body and soul 
In part, and in whole 
Because to someone, somewhere, oh yeah ... 
Alma matters 
In mind, body and soul 
In part, and in whole 
To someone, somewhere, oh yeah ... 
Alma matters 
In mind, body and soul 
Part, and in whole 
So to someone, somewhere, oh yeah ... 
Alma matters 
In mind, body and soul 
Part, and in whole 
To someone, somewhere, oh yeah ... 
Oh yeah ... Oh yeah, oh yeah Oh yeah ...

 

AMBITIOUS OUTSIDERS

Bolt-lock your doors 
Alarm your cars 
And still we move in closer 
Every day 
Top of the list 
Is your smiling kids 
But we'll be smiling too 
So that's OK 
Oh, and by the way 
Thank you, because you're 
Giving, giving, giving 
And we're receiving - 
No, no, we're taking 
Keeping the population down 
Your taxes paid, but 
Police waylaid 
And we knows 
When the school bus 
Comes and goes 
We're on your street, but 
You don't see us 
Or, if you do 
You smile and say Hello 
BUT DON'T UNDERESTIMATE US 
When you are 
Giving, giving, giving 
And we're receiving - 
No, no, we're taking 
Just keeping 
The population down 
You're giving, giving, giving 
Well, it's your own fault 
For reproducing 
We're just keeping 
The population down

 

TROUBLE LOVES ME

Trouble loves me 
Trouble needs me 
Two things 
More than you do 
Or would attempt to 
So, console me 
Otherwise, hold me 
Just when it seems like 
Everything's evened out 
And the balance 
Seems serene 
Trouble loves me 
Walks beside me 
To chide me 
Not to guide me 
It's still much more 
Than you'll do 
So, console me 
Otherwise, hold me 
Just when it seems like 
Everything's evened out 
And the balance seems serene 
See the fool I'll be 
Still running 'round 
On the flesh rampage 
Still running 'round 
Ready with ready-wit 
Still running 'round 
On the flesh rampage 
- At your age ! 
Go to Soho, oh 
Go to waste in 
The wrong arms 
Still running 'round 
Trouble loves me 
Seeks and finds me 
To charlatanize me 
Which is only 
As it should be 
Oh, please fulfill me 
Otherwise, kill me 
Show me a barrel and watch me scrape it 
Faced with the music, as always I'll face it 
In the half-light 
So English, frowning 
Then at midnight I 
Can't get you out of my head 
A disenchanted taste 
Still running 'round 
A disenchanted taste 
Still running 'round

 

PAPA JACK

Papa Jack 
Wants to turn 
Back the clock 
And reach out 
To the kids 
He once had 
Who have flown 
Papa Jack 
In decline 
Feels inclined 
To reach out 
To the kids 
He once had 
Who have flown 
But there was a time 
When the kids reached up 
And Papa Jack just 
Pushed them away 
Looking deep 
In his heart 
Papa Jack 
Doesn't like 
What he sees 
Or the time 
On his hands 
The dying day 
The chilly sun 
Papa Jack 
All alone 
Sings slow 
Grieving and low 
But there was a time 
When the kids reached up 
Now you can't always 
Have it your way 
Papa Jack 
Ah ...

 

AMMUNITION

I know these roads 
Each ridge 
And narrow bridge 
Each cheveron 
Enticing me on 
Each warning sign 
I take in my stride 
I don't need more ammunition 
I've got more than I can spend 
I don't dwell on things I'm missing 
I'm just pleased 
With the things I've found 
I know these roads 
An old hand understands 
Above all, I know what's 
Expected of me now 
Veering cliffwards 
I don't need more ammunition 
I've got more than I can spend 
I don't dwell on things I'm missing 
I'm just pleased 
With the things I've found 
With the things I've found 
With the things I've found 
I've found 
I've been crying 
It comes back on these salient days 
And it stays 
And it says : 
"We've never really been away" 
I don't need more ammunition 
I've got more than I can spend 
I don't think of who I'm missing 
I've got no space and no time 
In my life, anymore 
No space or time 
In my life, anymore 
For Revenge

 

WIDE TO RECEIVE

Download something 
Useful, or useless 
Because I'm lying here 
Wide to receive 
Almost anything 
You'd care to give 
And I don't 
Get along with myself 
And I'm not too keen 
On anyone else 
Turn on, plug in 
Then just walk away 
Unlock, process 
And then just go 
And I've never felt quite so alone 
As I do right now 
I'm lying here 
Wide to receive 
Almost anything 
You'd care to leave 
Wide, wide, wide Wide, wide, wide...

 

ROY'S KEEN

(GO ON !)
He's romancing you 
And chancing his arm 
He'll be here 
Smiling on time 
He's romancing you 
And chancing his arm 
He'll be here 
Smiling on time 
Roy's keen oh Roy's keen 
Roy's keen oh Roy's keen 
We've never seen a 
Keener window-cleaner 
Back up the ladder 
Into each corner 
Dunking the chamois 
Just think of the goodwill 
The ladder's a planet 
Roy is a star, and 
I am a satellite 
(But that's alright) 
He can hold a smile for as long 
As you require (even longer) 
He can hold a smile for as long 
As you require (even longer) 
Roy's keen oh Roy's keen 
Roy's keen oh Roy's keen 
We've never seen a 
Keener window-cleaner 
Back up the ladder 
Into each corner 
Dunking the chamois 
Just think of the goodwill 
The ladder's a planet 
Roy is a star, and 
I am a satellite 
I will be set alight 
Don't say you'll hold it steady 
Then you let it go 
Don't say you'll hold it steady 
Then you let it go Oh ...
You're up the ladder 
Into each corner 
Foot in a bucket 
We trust you to wreck it 
Even when it's under your nose 
Well, you just can't 
See it, can you ? 
Well, it's here 
Right under your nose 
And you just can't 
See it, can you? La la la la ...
Roy's keen, Roy's keen La la la la ...
We've never seen a 
Keener window-cleaner 
Oh ... La la la la ...

 

HE CRIED

I need you 
Simple words 
But words which had never been heard 
By the soul 
Stoned to death 
But still living 
And so he froze where he stood 
And he looked to the ground 
And he cried 
He cried 
Ride our minds 
If you must 
But there's always a line you don't cross 
Time is short 
Don't be cruel 
Oh you don't know the power 
In what you're saying 
Oh ... 
And so he froze where he stood 
And he looked to the ground 
And he cried 
He cried 
People where 
I come from 
They survive without feelings or blood 
I never could 
Was stoned to death 
But I'm still living 
So he froze where he stood 
And he looked to the ground 
And he cried 
He cried 
So he froze 
And he looked, and he looked 
To the ground 
And he cried 
He cried

 

SORROW WILL COME IN THE END

Legalized theft 
Leaves me bereft 
I get it straight in the neck 
(Somehow expecting no less) 
A court of justice 
With no use for Truth 
Lawyer ...liar 
Lawyer ...liar 
You pleaded and squealed 
And you think you've won 
But Sorrow will come 
To you in the end 
And as sure as my words are pure 
I praise the day that brings you pain 
Q.C.'s obsessed with sleaze 
Frantic for Fame 
They're all on the game 
They just use a different name 
You lied 
And you were believed 
By a J.P. senile and vile 
You pleaded and squealed 
And you think you've won 
But Sorrow will come 
To you in the end 
And as sure as my words are pure 
I praise the day that brings you pain 
So don't close your eyes 
Don't close your eyes 
A man who slits throats 
Has time on his hands 
And I'm gonna get you 
So don't close your eyes 
Don't ever close your eyes 
You think you've won 
OH NO

 

SATAN REJECTED MY SOUL

Satan rejected my soul 
He knows my kind 
He won't be dragged down 
He's seen my face around 
He knows Heaven doesn't seem 
To be my home 
So I must find 
Somewhere else to go 
So I must find 
Somewhere else to go 
So, take it - please 
It's free 
You'll never see 
You'll never see 
All the fun in life it's cost me 
Satan rejected my soul 
As low as he goes 
He never quite goes this low 
He's seen my face around 
He knows Heaven doesn't seem 
To be my home 
So I must find 
Somewhere else to go 
So I must find 
Somewhere else to go 
So, take it please 
It's really sly 
Come on, come on, ah Come on, come on, come on 
Take it please, It's really sly 
Come on, come on, ah Come on, come on, come on 
Call me in, Pull me in, call me in 
Come on, come on, oh Come on, come on, come on 
Pull me in, pull me in, Call me in, haul me in, pull me in 
Come on, come on, ah, Come on, come on 
La la la la la, Oh ...

 
 REEL AROUND THE FOUNTAIN

It's time the tale was told
of how you took a child
and you made him old
Reel around the fountain
slap me on the patio
I'll take it now
Fifteen minutes with you
well, I wouldn't say no
people said that you were virtually dead
and they were so wrong
fifteen minutes with you
well, i wouldn't say no
people said that you were easily led
and they were half-right
I dreamt about you last night
and i fell out of bed twice
you can pin and mount me like a butterfly
but take me to the haven of your bed
was something that you never said
two lumps, please
you're the bee's knees
but so am I
Meet me at the fountain
shove me on the patio
I'll take it slowly
Fifteen minutes with you
oh I wouldn't say no
people see no worth in you
oh but I do

 

YOU'VE GOT EVERYTHING NOW

As merry as the days were long
I was right and you were wrong
back at the old grey school
I would win and you would lose
But you've got everything now
and what a terrible mess I've made of my life
No, I've never had a job
because I've never wanted one
I've seen you smile
but I've never really heard you laugh
So who is rich and who is poor?
I cannot say...
You are your mother's only son
and you're a desperate one
But I don't want a lover
I just want to be seen in the back of your car
A friendship sadly lost?
Well, this is true ...and yet, it's false
Did I ever tell you , by the way
I never did like your face
But you've got everything now
and what a terrible mess I've made of my life
No, I've never had a job
because I'm too shy
But I don't want a lover
I just want to be tied to the back of your car.

 

MISERABLE LIE

So, goodbye
please stay with your own kind
and I'll stay with mine
There's something against us
it's not time
So, goodbye
I know I hardly say
how much I love your casual way
but please put your tongue away
a little higher and we're well away
the dark nights are drawing in
and your humour is as black as them
I look at yours, you laugh at mine
and"love" is just a miserable lie
you have destroyed my flower like-life
not once-but twice
you have corrupt my innocent mind
not once-but twice
I know that wind-swept mystical air
it means: I'd like to see your underwear
I recognise that mystical air
it means: I'd like to see your underwear
what do we get for the trouble and pain?
just a rented room in Whalley Range
into the depths of the criminal world
I followed her...
I need advice, I need advice
because nobody ever looks at me twice
I'm just a country-mile behind
the world
I'm just a country mile behind
the whole world
so take me when you go

 

PRETTY GIRLS MAKE GRAVES

Upon the sand,upon the bay
"there is a quick and easy way" you say
before you illustrate
I'd rather state:
"I'm not the man you think I am
I'm not the man you think I am "
And Sorrow's native son
he will not smile for anyone
And pretty girls makes the graves
End of the pier, end of the bay
you tug my arm and say:"Give into lust,
give up to lust, oh heaven knows we'll
soon be dust..."
But I'm not the man you think I am
I'm not the man you think I am
And Sorrow's native son
he will not rise for anyone
And pretty girls make graves
I could have been wild and I could have been free
but Nature played this trick on me
She wants it Now
and she will not wait
but she's too rough
and I'm too delicate
Then on the sand
another man, he takes her hand
and a smile lights up her stupid face
(and well, it would)
I lost my faith in Womanhood
I lost my faith in Womanhood, I lost my faith

 

THE HAND THAT ROCKS THE CRADLE

Please don't cry
the ghost and the storm outside
will not invade this sacred shire
nor infiltrate your mind
my life down I shall lie
if the bogey-man should try
to play tricks on your sacred mind
to tease, torment and tantalise
wavering shadows loom
a piano plays in an empty room
there'll be blood on the cleaver tonight
when darkness lifts and the room is bright
I'll still be by your side
for you are all that matters
and I'll love you till the day I die
there never need to be longing in your eyes
as long as the hand that rocks the cradle is mine
ceiling shadows shimmy by
and when the wardrobe towers like a beast of prey
there's a sadness in your beautiful eyes
you're untouched, unsoiled, wonderous eyes
my life down I shall lie
should restless spirts try
to play tricks on you sacred mind
but whom I never gave a name
I just looked into his wonderous eyes
and said" never never never again"
all too soon I did return
just like a moth to a flame
so rattle my bones all over the stones
because I'm only a beggar-man whom nobody owns
see how words as old as sin
fit me like a glove I'm here and here I'll stay
together we lie, together we pray
there never need be longing in your eyes
as long as the hand that rocks the cradle is mine

 

STILL ILL

I decree today that life
is simply taking and not giving
England is mine and it owes me a living
ask me why, and I'll spit in your eye
ask me why, and I'll spit in your eye
but we cannot cling to the old dreams anymore
no, we cannot cling to the old dreams anymore
Does the body rule the mind
or does the mind rule the body?
I dunno...
Under the iron bridge we kissed
and although I ended up with sore lips
it just wasn't like the old days anymore
no, it wasn't like those days
am I still ill?
Does the body rule the mind
or does the mind rule the body ?
I dunno...
Ask me why, and I'll die
ask me why, and I'll die
and if you must go to work tomorrow
well, if I were you I wouldn't bother
for there are brighter sides to life
and I should know because I've seen them
but not very often...
under the iron bridge we kissed
and although I ended up with sore lips
it just wasn't like the old days anymore
no, it wasn't like those days
am I still ill?

 

HAND IN GLOVE

Hand in glove
the sun shines out of our behinds
no, it's not like any other love
this one is different-because it's us
Hand in glove
we can go wherever we please
and everything depends upon
how near you stand to me
And if the people stare
then the people stare
I really don't know and I really don't care
Hand in glove
the Good People laugh
yes, we may be hidden by rags
but we have something they'll never have
So, hand in glove I stake my claim
I'll fight to the last breath
If they dare touch a hair on your head
I'll fight to the last breath
The Good Life is out there, somewhere
so stay on my arm, you little charmer
But I know my luck too well
and I'll probably never see you again.

 

WHAT DIFFERENCE DOES IT MAKE?

All men have secrets and here is mine
so let it be known
we have been through hell and high tide,
I can surely rely on you?
and yet you start to recoil,
heavy words are so lightly thrown
but still I'd leap in front of a flying bullet for you
So, what difference does it make?
so, what difference does it make?
it makes none
but you have gone
and you must be looking very old tonight
The devil will find work for idle hands to do
I stole and I lied, and why?
because you asked me to!
but now you make feel so ashamed
because I've only got two hands
well, I'm still fond of you
So, what difference does it make?
so, what difference does it make?
it makes none
but you have gone
and your prejudice won't keep you warm tonight
So, no more apologies
no more apologies
I'm too tired
I'm too sick and tired
and I'm feeling very sick and ill today
But I'm still fond of you

 

I DON'T OWE YOU ANYTHING

Bought on stolen wine
a nod was the first step
you know very well
what was coming next
did I really walk all this way
just to hear you say
"oh I don't want to go out tonight"
but you will
for you must
I don't owe you anything
but you owe me something
repay me now
you should never go to them
let them come to you
just like I do
you should not go to them
let them come to you
just like I do
Too freely on your lips
words prematurely said
oh but I know what will make you smile tonight
Life is never kind
life is never kind
oh but I know what will make you smile tonight

 

SUFFER LITTLE CHILDREN

Over the moors,take me to the moors
dig a shallow grave
and I'll lay me down
Lesley-Anne, with your pretty white beads
oh John, you'll never be a man
and you'll never see your home again
oh Manchester, so much to answer for
Edward, see those alluring lights?
tonight will be your very last night
a woman said "I know my son is dead
I'll never rest my hands on his scared head"
Hindley wakes and Hindley says:
"Wherever he has gone, I have gone "
But fresh lilaced moorland fields
cannot hide the stoild stench of death
Hindley wakes and Hindley says:
"Whatever he has done, I have done"
But this is no easy ride
for a child cries
"find me...find me, nothing more
we're on a sullen misty moor
we may be dead and we may be gone
but we will be right by your side
until the day you die
this is no easy ride
we will haunt you when you laugh
yes, you could say we're a team
you might sleep
BUT YOU WILL NEVER DREAM!"
Oh Manchester, so much to answer for
Oh Manchester, so much to answer for
Over the moor, I'm on the moor
the child is on the moor

 

THE HEADMASTER RITUAL

Belligerent ghouls
run Manchester schools
spineless swines
cemented mines
Sir leads the troops
jealous of youth
same old suit since 1962
he does the military two-step
down the nape of my neck
I wanna go home
I don't want to stay
give up education
is a bad mistake
mid-week on the playing fields
Sir thwacks you on the knees
knees you in the groin
elbow in the face
I wanna go home
I don't want to stay
Belligerent ghouls
run Manchester schools
spineless bastards all
Sir leads the troops
jealous of youth
same old jokes since 1902
he does the military two-step
down the nape of my neck
I wanna go home
I don't want to stay
give up life
as a bad mistake
please excuse me from gym
I've got this terrible cold coming on
he grabs and devours
he kicks me in the showers
kicks me in the showers
and he grabs and devours
I wanna go home
I don't want to stay

 

RUSHOLME RUFFIANS

The last night at the fair
by the big wheel generator
a boy is stabbed
and his money is grabbed
and the air hangs heavy like a dulling wine
she is famous
she is funny
an engagement ring
doesn't mean a thing
to a mind consumed by brass(money)
and though I walk home alone
my faith in love is still devout
the last night at the fair
from a seat on a whirling waltzer
her skirt ascends for a watching eye
it's a hideous trait( on her mother's side)
and though I walk home alone
my faith in love is still devout
then someone falls in love
and someone's beaten up
and the senses being dulled are mine

this is the last night of the fair
and the grease in the hair
of a speedway operator
is all a tremulous heart requires
a schoolgirl is denied
she said "How quickly would I die
if I jumped from the top of the parachutes?"

I WANT THE ONE I CAN'T HAVE

On the day that your mentality
catches up with your biology
I want the one I can't have
and it's driving me mad
it's written all over my face
A double-bed
and a stalwart lover, for sure
these are the riches of the poor
A double-bed
and a stalwart lover, for sure
these are the riches of the poor
a tough kid who sometimes swallows nails
raised on Prisoner's Aid
he killed a policeman when he was thirteen
and somehow that really impressed me
it's written all over my face
On the day that your mentality
catches up with your biology
And if you ever need self-validation
just meet me in the alley by the
railway-station
it's written all over my face

 

WHAT SHE SAID

What she said:
"How come someone hasn't noticed
that I'm dead
and decided to bury me
God knows, I'm ready"
What she said was
but then, all the rejection she's had
to pretend to be happy
could only be idiocy
What she said was not for the job or
lover that she never had
What she read
all heady books
she'd sit and prophesise
(it took a tattoed boy from Birkenhead
to really really open her eyes)

THAT JOKE ISN'T FUNNY ANYMORE

Park the car at the side of the road
you should know
time's tide will smother you
and I will too
when you laugh about other people who feel so
very lonely
their only desire is to die
well I'm afraid
it doesn't make me smile
I wish I could laugh
but that joke isn't funny anymore
it's too close to home and it's too near the bone
it's too close to home and it's too near the bone
more than you'll ever know
It was dark as I drove the point home
and on cold leather seats
well, it suddenly struck me
I just might die with a smile on my
face after all
I've seen this happen in other people's lives
and now it's happening in mine

 

NOWHERE FAST

I'd like to drop my trousers to the world
I am a man of means(of slender means)
each household appliance
is like a new science in my town
and if a day came when I felt a natural emotion
I'd get such a shock I'd probably jump in the ocean
and when a train goes by
it's such a sad sound
I'd like to drop my trousers to the Queen
every sensible child will know what this means
the poor and the needy
are selfish and greedy on her terms
and if the day came when I felt a natural emotion
I'd get such a shock I'd probably jump in the ocean
and when a train goes by
it's such a sad song
And when I'm lying in my bed
I think about life
and I think about death
and neither one particularly appeals to me
and if the day came when I felt a natural emotion
I'd get such a shock I'd probably lie
in the middle of the street and die
I'd lie down and die

 

WELL I WONDER

Well I wonder
do you hear me when you sleep?
I hoarsely cry
Well I wonder
do you see me when we pass?
I half-die
Please keep me in mind
please keep me in mind
Gasping-but somehow still alive
this is the fierce last stand of all I am
Gasping-dying-but somehow still alive
this is the final stand of all I am
Please keep me in mind

 

BARBARISM BEGINS AT HOME

Unruly boys
who will not grow up
must be taken in hand
Unruly girls
who will not settle down
they must be taken in hand
A crack on the head
is what you get for not asking
and a crack on the head
is what you get for asking

 

MEAT IS MURDER

Heifer whines could be human cries
closer comes the screaming knife
this beautiful creature must die
this beautiful creature must die
a death for no reason
and death for reason is MURDER
and the flesh you so fancifully fry
is not succulent, tasty or nice
it's death for no reason
and death for no reason is MURDER
and the calf that you carve with a smile
is MURDER
and the turkey you festively slice
is MURDER
do you know how animals die?
kitchen aroma aren't very homely
it's not "comforting," "cheery" or kind
it's sizzling blood and the unholy stench
of MURDER
it's not "natural," "normal" or kind
the fleas you so fancifully fry
as you savour the flavour
of MURDER
NO, NO, NO, IT'S MURDER
NO, NO, NO, IT'S MURDER
who hears when animals cry?

 

THE QUEEN IS DEAD

Farewell to this lands cheerless marches
hemmed in like a boar between arches
her very Lowness with her head in a sling
Im truely sorry-but it sounds like a wonderful thing
dear Charles, dont you ever crave
to appear on the front of the Daily mail
dressed in your Mother's bridal veil?
So, I checked all the registered historical facts
and I was shocked into shame to discover
how Im the 18th pale descendent
of some, old queen or other
has the world changed, or have I changed?
has the world changed, or have I changed?
as some 9-year old tough peddles drugs
(I never even knew what drugs were)
And so, I broke into the Palace
with a sponge and a rusty spanner
she said: "Eh, I know you, and you cannot sing"
I said: "that's nothing -you should hear me play piano"
We can go for a walk where it's quiet and dry
and we can talk about precious things
but when you are tied to your mother's apron
not one talks about castration
We can go for a walk where it's quiet and dry
and we can talk about precious things
like love and law and poverty
these are the things that kill me
We can go for a walk where it's quiet and dry
and we can talk about precious things
but the rain that flattens my hair
theses are the things that kill me
Passed the Pub that saps your body
and the church who'll snatch your money
the Queen is dead, boys
and it's so lonely on a limb
Pass the Pub that wrecks your body
and the church-all they want is your money
the Queen is dead, boys`
you can trust me, boys
life is very long, when you're lonely
life is very long, when you're lonely...

 

FRANKLY MR.SHANKLY

Frankly, Mr Shankly, this position Ive held
it pays my way, but it corrodes my soul
I want to leave you will not miss me
I want to go down in musical history
Frankly, Mr Shankly, Im a sickening wreck
Ive got the 21st Century breathing down my neck
I must move fast, you understand me
I want to go down in celluloid history
Fame, Fame, fatal Fame
it can play hideous tricks on the brain
but still I rather be Famous
than righteous or holy, any day
but sometimes Id feel more fulfilled
making Christmas cards with the mentally ill
I want to Live and I want to Love
I want to catch something that I might be ashamed of
Frankly, Mr Shankly, this position I've held
it pays my way and it corrodes my soul
oh, I didnt realise that you wrote poetry
(I didnt realise you wrote such bloody awful poetry)
Frankly, Mr Shankly, since you ask
you are a flatulent pain the arse
I do not mean to be so rude
but still, I must speck frankly, Mr Shankly

 

I KNOW IT'S ALL OVER

Oh Mother, I can fell the soil falling over my head
and as i climb into an empty bed
Oh well, Enough said
I know it's over-still I cling
I don't know where else I can go
Oh Mother, I can feel the soil falling over my head
see, the sea want s to take me
the knife wants to cut me
do you think you can help me?
Sad veiled bride, please be happy
handsome groom, give her room
loud, loutish lover, treat her kindly
(although she needs you
more than she loves you)
and I know it's over
and it never really began
but in my heart it was so real
and you even spoke to me and said:
"If you're so funny
then why are you on your own tonight?
and if you are so clever
then why are you on your own tonight?
if you're so terribly good looking
then why do you sleep alone tonight?
because tonight is just like any other night
that's why you're on your own tonight
with your triumphs and your charms
while they are in each other's arms.."
It's so easy to laugh
it's so easy to hate
it takes strength to be gentle and kind
It's so easy to laugh
it's so easy to hate
it takes guts to be gentle and kind
love is Natural and Real
but not for you, my love
not tonight my love
love is Natural and Real
but not for such as you and I, my love
Oh Mother, I can fell the soil falling over my head
Oh Mother, I can fell the soil falling over my head...

 

NEVER HAD NO ONE EVER

When you walk without ease
on these
the very streets where you were raised
I had a really bad dream
it lasted 20 years, 7 months, and 27 days
Never had no one ever.

 

CEMETERY GATES

A dreaded sunny day
so I meet you at the cemetry gates
Keats and Yeats are on your side
A dreaded sunny day
so I meet you at the cemetry gates
Keats and Yeats are on your side
while Wilde is on mine
So we go inside and we gravely read the stones
all those people all those lives
where are they now ?
with loves, and hates
and passions just like mine
they were born
and then they lived and then they died
which seems so unfair
and I wantr to crv
You say: "ere thrice the sun hath done salutation to the dawn"
and you claim these words as your own
but Im well-read, have heard them said
a hundred times (maybe less, maybe more)
if you must write prose/poems
the words you use should be your own
dont plagiarise or take "on loans"
there's alweays someone, somewhere
with a big nose, who knows
and who trips you up and laughs
when you fall
You say: "ere long done do does did "
words which could only be your own
you then produce the text
from whence was ripped
(some dizzy whore, 1804)
A dreaded sunny day
so let's go where we're happy
so I meet you at the cemetry gates
Keats and Yeats are on your side
A dreaded sunny day
so let's go where we're wanted
so I meet you at the cemetry gates
Keats and Yeats are on your side
but you lose
because Wilde is on mine

 

BIGMOUTH STRIKES AGAIN

Sweetness, sweetness I was only joking
when I said Id like to smash every tooth
in your head
Sweetness, sweetness I was only joking
when I said by right s you should be
bludgeoned in your bed
and now I know how Joan of Arc felt
now I know how Joan of Arc felt
as the flames roseto her roman nose
and her Walkman stared to melt
Bibmouth, bigmouth
bigmouth strikes again
and Ive got no right to take my place
with the Human race
and now I know how Joan of Arc felt
now I know of Joan of Arc felt
as the flames rose to her roman nose
and her hearing aid started to melt
Bigmouth, bigmouth
bigmouth strikes again
and Ive got no right to take my place
with the Human race

 

THE BOY WITH A THORN IN HIS SIDE

The boy with the thorn in his side
behind the hatred there lies
a murderous desire for love
how can they look into my eyes
and still they dont believe me
how can they hear me say those words
and still they dont believe me
and if they don't believe me now
will they ever believe me?
and if they don't believe me now
will they ever believe me?
The boy with the thorn in his side
behind the hatred there lies
a plundering desire for love
how can they see the Love in our eyes
and still they don't believe us
and after all this time
they don't want to believe us
and if they dont believe us now
will they ever believe us ?
andd when you want to Live
how do you start ?
where do you go ?
who do you know?

 

VICAR IN A TUTU

I was minding mind business
lifting some lead off
the roof of the Holy Name church
it was worthwhile living a laughable life
just to set my eyes on a blistering sight
of a vicar in a tu-tu
he's not strange
he just wants to live his life this way
a scanty bit of a thing
with a decorative ring
that wouldn't cover the head of a child
as Rose collects the money in the cannister
who comes sliding down the bannister
the vicar in a tu-tu
he's not strange
he just wants to live his life this way
the monkish monsignor
with a head full of plaster
said "my man, get your vile soul dry-cleaned"
as Rose counts the money in the cannister
as natural as rain
he dances again
vicar in a tu-tu
The next day in the pulpit
with Freedom and Ease
combating ignoranca,dust and disease
as Rose counts the money in the cannister
as natural as rain
he dances again
the fabric of a tu-tu
any man could get us to
and I am a living sign.

 

THERE IS A LIGHT THAT NEVER GOES OUT

Take me out tonight
where there's music and there's people
who are young and alive
driving in your car
I never never want to go home
because I havent got one
anymore
take me out tonight
because I want to see people and I
want to see lights
driving in your car
oh please dont drop me home
because it's not my home, it's their
home, and Im welcome no morw
and if a double-decker bus
crashes in to us
to die by your side
such a heavenly way to die
and if a ten ton truck
kills the both of us
to die by your side
the pleasure and the privilege is mine
take me out tonight
oh take me anywhere, I dont care
and in the darken underpass
I thought Oh God, my chance has come at last
(but then a strange fear gripped me and I just couldn't ask)
take me out tonight
take me anywhere, I dont care
just driving in your car
I never never want to go home
because I havent got one
I havent got one.

 

SOME GIRLS ARE BIGGER THAN OTHERS

From the ice-age to the dole-age
there is but one concern
and I have just discover
some girls are bigger than others
some girls are bigger than others
some girls mothers are bigger than
other girls mothers
As Anthony said to Cleopatra
as he opened a crate of ale:
some girls are bigger than others
some girls are bigger than others
some girls mothers are bigger than
other girls mothers.

 

A RUSH AND A PUSH AND AND THE LAND IS OURS

HELLO
I am the ghost of Troubled Joe
hung by his pretty white neck
some eighteen months ago
I travelled to a mystical time zone
but I missed my bed
so I soon came home
they said:
"there's too much caffeine
in your bloodstream
and a lack of real spice
in your life"
I said:
"leave me alone
because I'm alright, dad
just surprised to still
be on my own...."
Ooh, but don't mention love
I'd hate the real strain of the pain again
a rush and a push and the land that
we stand on is ours
it has been before
so it shall be again
and people who are uglier than you and I
they take what they need, and leave
Ooh, but don't mention love
I'd hate the pain and the strain all over again
a rush and a push and the land that
we stand on is ours
it has been before
so why can't it be now?
and people who are weaker than you and I
they take what they want from life
Ooh, but don't mention love
no - just don't mention love!
a rush and a push and the land that
we stand on is ours
your youth may be gone
but you're still a young man
so phone me, phone me, phone me
so phone me, phone me, phone me
Ooh, I think I'm in love...
Urrgh, I think I'm in lerv

 

I STARTED SOMETHING I COULDN'T FINISH

The lanes were silent
with nothing or no one around for miles
I doused our friendly venture
with a hard-faced
three-word gesture
I started something
I forced you into a zone
and you were clearly
never meant to go
hair brushed and parted
typical me, typical me, typical me
I started something
...and now I'm not too sure
I grabbed you by the guilded beams
that's what Tradition means
and I doused another venture
with a gesture
that was...absolutely vile
I started something
forced you to a zone
and you were clearly
never meant to go
hair brushed and parted
typical me, typical me, typical me
I started something
...and now I'm not too sure
I grabbed you by the guilded beams
that's what Tradition means
and now eighteen months' hard-labour
seems...fair enough
I started something
forced you to a zone
and you were clearly
never meant to go

typical me, typical me, typical me

DEATH OF A DISCO DANCER

The death of a disco dancer
well, it happens a lot 'round here
and if you think Peace
is a common goal
well, that goes to show
just how little you know
The death of a disco dancer
well, I'd rather not get involved
I never talk to my neighbour
I'd just rather not get involved
Love, peace and harmony?
Love, peace and harmony?
Oh, very nice, very nice, very nice, very nice
...but maybe in the next world.

 

GIRLFRIEND IN A COMA

Girlfriend in a coma, I know
I know - it's serious
Girlfriend in a coma, I know
I know - it's really serious
there wree times when I could
have 'murdered' her
(but, you know, I would hate
anything to happen to her)
NO, I DON'T WANT TO SEE HER
Do you really think
she'll pull through?
Do you really think
she'll pull through?
Girlfriend in a coma, I know
I know, it's serious
there were time when I could
have 'strangeled' her
(but, you know, I would hate

WOULD YOU PLEASE LET ME SEE HER!
Do you really think she'll pull through?
Do you really think she'll pull through?
Let me wisper my last goodbyes
I know - IT'S SERIOUS

 

STOP ME IF YOU'VE HEARD THIS ONE BEFORE

Stop me, stop me,
stop me if you think that you've heard this one before
stop me, stop me
stop me if you think that you've heard this one before
nothing's changed
I still love you, oh I still love you
...only slightly less than I used to
I was delayed, I was way-laid
an emergency stop
I smelt the last ten seconds of life
I crashed down on the crossbar
and the pain was enough to make
a shy, bald buddhist reflect
and plan a mass-murder
who said I'd lied to her?
who said I'd lied because I never
who said I'd lied because I never
I was detained, I was restrained
he broke my spleen
he broke my knees
(and then he really laid into me)
Friday night in Out-patients
who said I'd lied to her?
who said I'd lied - because I never
who said I'd lied - because I never
Oh, so I drank one
or was it four
and when I fell on the floor
...I drank more
stop me, stop me
stop me if you think that you've heard this one before
nothing's changed
I still love you, I still love you
but only slightly
less than I used to

 

LAST NIGHT I DREAMT THAT SOMEBODY LOVED ME

Last night I dreamt
that somebody loved me
no hope - but no harm
just another false alarm
Las night I felt
real arms around me
no hope - no harm
just another false alarm
so, tell me how long
before the last one?
and tell me how long
before the right one?
this story is old - I KNOW
but it goes on
this story is old - I KNOW
but it goes on

 

UNHAPPY BIRTHDAY

I've come to wish you an unhappy birthday
I've come to wish you an unhappy birthday
because you're evil
and you lie
and if you should die
I may feel slightly sad
(but I won't cry)
Loved and lost
and some may say
when usually its Nothing
surely you're happy
it should be this way?
I say "No, I'm gonna kill my dog"
and: "May the lines sag heavy
and deep tonight XXX"

PAINT A VULGAR PICTURE

At the record company meeting
On their hands - a dead star
and ooh, the plans that they weave
and ooh, the sikening greed
At the record company meeting
on their hands - a dead star
the sycophantic slags all say:
"I knew him first, and I knew him well"
Re-issue! Re-package! Re-package!
Re-evaluate the songs
double-pack with a photograph
Extra Track (and a tacky badge)
A-list, playlist
"Please them, please them!"
"Please them! Please them!"
(sadly, THIS was your life)
but you could have said no
if you'd wanted to
you could have said no
if you'd wanted to
BPI, MTV, BBC
"Please them! Please them!"
(sadly this was your life)
but you could have said no
if you'd wanted to
you could have walked away
...couldn't you?
I touched you at the soundcheck
you had no real way of knowing
in my heart I bgged "please, take
me with you...
I don't care where you're going"
But to you I was faceless
I was fawning, I was boring
just a child from those ugly new houses
who could never begin to know
who could never really know
Best of? Most of?
Satiate the need
slip them into different sleeves!
Buy both, and be decieved
climber - new entry, re-entry
World tour! ("media whore")
"Please the Press in Belgium!"
(THIS was your life...)
and when it fails to recoup?
Well, maybe:
You just haven't earned it yet, baby
I walked a pace behind you at the soundcheck
you're just the same as I am
what makes most people feel happy
leads us headlong into harm
so, in my bedroom in those 'ugly new houses'
I dance my legs down to the knees
but me and my 'true love'
we will never meet again...
At the record company meeting
on their hands - at last! - a dead star!
but they cannot taint you in my eyes
no, they cannout touch you now
No, they cannot hurt you my darling
they cannot touch you now
but me and my 'true love'
will never meet again

 

DEATH AT ONE'S ELBOW

Ooh Glenn, don't come to the house tonight
Ooh, Glenn, don't come to the house tonight
because there's somebody here
who really really loves you
stay home
be bored
(it's crap, I KNOW)
Ooh, Glenn, don't come to the house tonight
Ooh, Glen, don't come to the house tonight
because there's somebody here
who'll take a hatchet to your ear
how the frustration renders me
hateful, Glenn!
don't come to the house tonight
don't come to the house tonight
because you'll slip on the
trail of my bespattered remains
and so, that's why
GOODBYE MY LOVE, GOODBYE MY LOVE, GOODBYE MY LOVE...
Belch

 

I WON'T SHARE YOU

I won't share you
I won't share you
with the drive and ambition
and the zeal I feel
this is my time
as the note I wrote
was read, she said
has the Perrier gone
straight to my head
or is life plainly sick and cruel, instead?
"YES!"
No-no-no-no-no-no
I won't share you
I won't share you
with the drive and the dreams inside
this is my time
Life tends to come and go
well, that's OK
just as long as you know
Life tends to come and go
well, that's OK

I won't share you

THE QUEEN IS DEAD

Farewell to this lands cheerless marches
hemmed in like a boar between arches
her very Lowness with her head in a sling
Im truely sorry-but it sounds like a wonderful thing
dear Charles, dont you ever crave
to appear on the front of the Daily mail
dressed in your Mother's bridal veil?
So, I checked all the registered historical facts
and I was shocked into shame to discover
how Im the 18th pale descendent
of some, old queen or other
has the world changed, or have I changed?
has the world changed, or have I changed?
as some 9-year old tough peddles drugs
(I never even knew what drugs were)
And so, I broke into the Palace
with a sponge and a rusty spanner
she said: "Eh, I know you, and you cannot sing"
I said: "that's nothing -you should hear me play piano"
We can go for a walk where it's quiet and dry
and we can talk about precious things
but when you are tied to your mother's apron
not one talks about castration
We can go for a walk where it's quiet and dry
and we can talk about precious things
like love and law and poverty
these are the things that kill me
We can go for a walk where it's quiet and dry
and we can talk about precious things
but the rain that flattens my hair
theses are the things that kill me
Passed the Pub that saps your body
and the church who'll snatch your money
the Queen is dead, boys
and it's so lonely on a limb
Pass the Pub that wrecks your body
and the church-all they want is your money
the Queen is dead, boys`
you can trust me, boys
life is very long, when you're lonely
life is very long, when you're lonely...

 

PANIC

Panic on the streets of London
Panic on the streets of Birmingham
I wonder to myself
Could life ever be sane again
on the Leeds side-streets that you slip down
I wonder to myself
Hopes may rise on the Grasmeres
But Honey Pie, you're not safe here
So you run down
To the safety of the town
But there's Panic on the streets of Carlisle
Dublin, Dundee, Humberside
I wonder to myself
Burn down the Disco
Hang the blessed D.J.
Because the music that they constantly play
IT SAYS NOTHING TO ME ABOUT MY LIFE
Hang the blessed D.J.
Because the music they constantly play
On the Leeds side-streets that you slip down
On the provincial towns that you jog 'round
Hang the D.J.,. Hang the D.J.,.Hang the D.J...

ASK

Shyness is nice, but
Shyness can stop you
From doing all the things in life
That you'd like to
So, if there's something you'd like to try
ASK ME-I WON'T SAY "NO"-HOW COULD I?
Coyness is nice, but ,
Coyness can stop you
from saying all the things in
life that you want to
If there's something that you'd like to try
ASK ME-I WON'TSAY"NO"-HOW COULD I?
Spending warm, Summer days indoors
Writing fringhtening verse
To a buck-toothed girl in Luxembourg
ASK ME, ASK ME ,ASK ME, ASK ME, ASK ME ,ASK ME
Because if it's not Love
Then it's the Bomb
That will bring us together
Nature is a language-can't you read?
Nature is a language-can't you read?
ASK ME, ASK ME ,ASK ME, ASK ME, ASK ME ,ASK ME
Because if it's not Love
Then it's the Bomb

MARIE'S THE NAME (HIS LATEST FLAME) / RUSHOLME RUFFIANS

Very old friend 
Came by today 
As he was telling everyone in town 
Of all the love that he'd just found 
And Marie's the name (of his latest flame) 
Talked and talked 
And I heard him say 
That she had the longest blackest hair 
Prettiest green eyes anywhere 
And Marie's the name (of his latest flame) 
The last night of the fair 
By the big wheel generator 
A boy is stabbed 
His money is grabbed 
And the air hangs heavy like a dulling wine 
She is Famous 
She is Funny 
An engagement ring 
Doesn't mean a thing 
To a mind consumed by brass (money), oh 
The last night of the fair 
From a seat on a whirling waltzer 
Her skirt ascends for a watching eye 
It's a hideous trait (on her mother's side)
From a seat on a whirling waltzer 
Her skirt ascends for a watching eye 
A hideous trait (on her mother's side) 
Then someone falls in love 
Someone's beaten up 
Someone's beaten up 
And the senses being dulled are mine 
And someone falls in love 
Someone's beaten up 
And the senses being dulled are mine 
This is the last night of the fair 
And the grease in the hair 
Of a speedway operator 
Is all a tremulous heart requires 
A schoolgirl is denied 
She said : "How quickly would I die 
If I jumped from the top of the parachutes ?"
This is the last night of the fair 
And the grease in the hair 
Of a speedway operator 
Is all a tremulous heart requires 
A schoolgirl is denied 
She said : "How quickly would I die 
Oh, if I jumped from the top of the parachutes ?"
...Oh, walk home alone 
I might walk home alone 
But my faith in love is still devout

 

THE BOY WITH THE THORN IN HIS SIDE

The boy with the thorn in his side
behind the hatred there lies
a murderous desire for love
how can they look into my eyes
and still they dont believe me
how can they hear me say those words
and still they dont believe me
and if they don't believe me now
will they ever believe me?
and if they don't believe me now
will they ever believe me?

andd when you want to Live
how do you start ?
where do you go ?
who do you know?

 

RUBBER RING / WHAT SHE SAID

Yeah! What she says : 
"How come someone hasn't noticed 
That I'm dead 
And decided to bury me ? 
God knows, I'm ready !"
La-la-la ... 
What she said was sad 
But then, all the rejection she's had 
To pretend to be happy 
Could only be idiocy 
La-la-la ... 
What she said was not for the job or 
Lover that she never had 
No no no ... 
What she read 
All heady books 
She'd sit and prophesise 
(It took a tattooed boy from 
Birkenhead 
To really really open her eyes)

IS IT REALLY SO STRANGE?

I left the North 
I travelled South 
I found a tiny house 
And I can't help the way I feel 
Oh yes, you can kick me 
And you can punch me 
And you can break my face 
But you won't change the way I feel 
'Cause I love you, Oh ... 
And is it really so strange ? 
Oh, is it really so strange ? 
Oh, is it really so, really so strange ? 
I say NO, you say YES 
(and you will change your mind) 
I left the South 
I travelled North 
I got confused - I killed a horse 
I can't help the way I feel 
Oh yes, you can punch me 
And you can butt me 
And you can break my spine 
But you won't change the way I feel 
'Cause I love you, Oh ... 
And is it really so strange ? 
Oh, is it really so strange ? 
Oh, is it really so, really so strange ? 
I say NO, you say YES 
(But you will change your mind) 
I left the North again 
I travelled South again 
And I got confused - I killed a nun 
I CAN'T HELP THE WAY I FEEL 
(I lost my bag in Newport Pagnell) 
Why is the last mile the hardest mile ? 
My throat was dry, with the sun in my eyes 
And I realised, I realised 
I could never 
I could never, never, never, go back home again

 

CEMETERY GATES

A dreaded sunny day
so I meet you at the cemetry gates
Keats and Yeats are on your side
A dreaded sunny day
so I meet you at the cemetry gates
Keats and Yeats are on your side
while Wilde is on mine
So we go inside and we gravely read the stones
all those people all those lives
where are they now ?
with loves, and hates
and passions just like mine
they were born
and then they lived and then they died
which seems so unfair
and I wantr to crv
You say: "ere thrice the sun hath done salutation to the dawn"
and you claim these words as your own
but Im well-read, have heard them said
a hundred times (maybe less, maybe more)
if you must write prose/poems
the words you use should be your own
dont plagiarise or take "on loans"
there's alweays someone, somewhere
with a big nose, who knows
and who trips you up and laughs
when you fall
You say: "ere long done do does did "
words which could only be your own
you then produce the text
from whence was ripped
(some dizzy whore, 1804)
A dreaded sunny day
so let's go where we're happy
so I meet you at the cemetry gates
Keats and Yeats are on your side
A dreaded sunny day
so let's go where we're wanted
so I meet you at the cemetry gates
Keats and Yeats are on your side
but you lose
because Wilde is on mine

 

LONDON

Smoke
Lingers 'round your fingers
Train
Heave on - to Euston
Do you think you've made
The right decision this time?
You left
Your tired family grieving
And you think they're sad because you're leaving
But didn't you see the Jealousy in the eyes
Of the ones who had to stay behind?
And do you think you've made
The right decision thins time?
You left
Your girlfriend on the platform
With thei really ragged notion that you'll return
But she knows
That when he goes
He really goes
So do you think you've made
The right decision this time?

 

I KNOW IT'S OVER

I can feel the soil falling over my head 
And as I climb into an empty bed 
Oh well. Enough said. 
I know it's over - still I cling 
I don't know where else I can go 
Over ... 
Oh Mother, I can feel the soil falling over my head 
See, the sea wants to take me 
The knife wants to cut me 
Do you think you can help me ? 
Sad veiled bride, please be happy 
Handsome groom, give her room 
Loud, loutish lover, treat her kindly 
(Though she needs you 
More than she loves you) 
And I know it's over - still I cling 
I don't know where else I can go 
Over, it's over, it's over, it's over 
It's over, la ... 
I know it's over 
And it never really began 
But in my heart it was so real
And you even spoke to me, and said : 
"If you're so funny 
Then why are you on your own tonight ? 
And if you're so clever 
Then why are you on your own tonight ? 
I know ... 
'Cause tonight - it's just like any other night 
That's why you're on your own tonight 
Your triumphs and your charms 
While they're in each other's arms..."
It's so easy to laugh 
It's so easy to hate 
It takes strength to be gentle and kind 
Over, over, over, over 
It's so easy to laugh 
It's so easy to hate 
It takes guts to be gentle and kind 
Over, over 
Love is Natural and Real 
But not for you, my love 
Not tonight, my love 
Love is Natural and Real 
But not for such as you and I, my love 
Oh Mother, I can feel the soil falling over my head...
Oh Mother, I can feel the soil fall over, fall over my head 
Oh Mother, I can feel the ... fall over my ... , Oh ...

 

THE DRAIZE TRAIN

A vastly superior version of the instrumental B-side, acting as a peace

STILL ILL

I decree today that life
is simply taking and not giving
England is mine and it owes me a living
ask me why, and I'll spit in your eye
ask me why, and I'll spit in your eye
but we cannot cling to the old dreams anymore
no, we cannot cling to the old dreams anymore
Does the body rule the mind
or does the mind rule the body?
I dunno...
Under the iron bridge we kissed
and although I ended up with sore lips
it just wasn't like the old days anymore
no, it wasn't like those days
am I still ill?
Does the body rule the mind
or does the mind rule the body ?
I dunno...
Ask me why, and I'll die
ask me why, and I'll die
and if you must go to work tomorrow
well, if I were you I wouldn't bother
for there are brighter sides to life
and I should know because I've seen them
but not very often...
under the iron bridge we kissed
and although I ended up with sore lips
it just wasn't like the old days anymore
no, it wasn't like those days
am I still ill?

 

BIGMOUTH STRIKES AGAIN

Sweetness, sweetness I was only joking
when I said Id like to smash every tooth
in your head
Sweetness, sweetness I was only joking
when I said by right s you should be
bludgeoned in your bed
and now I know how Joan of Arc felt
now I know how Joan of Arc felt
as the flames roseto her roman nose
and her Walkman stared to melt
Bibmouth, bigmouth
bigmouth strikes again
and Ive got no right to take my place
with the Human race
and now I know how Joan of Arc felt
now I know of Joan of Arc felt
as the flames rose to her roman nose
and her hearing aid started to melt
Bigmouth, bigmouth
bigmouth strikes again
and Ive got no right to take my place
with the Human race

 
ALSATIAN COUSTIN

Were you and he Lovers?
and would you say so if you were?
on a forecourt
on a Friday
passing my way
Were you and he Lovers?
and if you were, then say that you were!
on a groundsheet
under canvas
with your tent-flap
open wide
A note upon his desk:
"P.S. Bring Me Home And Have Me!"
Leather elbows on a tweed coat
- Oh! -
Is THAT the best you can do?
So came his reply:
"...but on the desk is where I want you!"
So I ask (even though I know):
were you and he Lovers?

 

LITTLE MAN, WHAT NOW?

An afternoon nostalgia
television show
you spoke in silhouette
(but they couldn't name you)
although the panel were
very polite to you
but I remembered you
from Friday nights 1969
ATV - you murdered every line
too old to be a child star
too young to take leads
four seasons passed
and they AXED you
nervously juvenile
(WON'T SMILE!)
What became of you?
did that swift eclipse torture you?
a star at eighteen
and then-suddenly gone
down to a few lines
in the back page of a teenage annual
oh but I remembered you
I looked up to you

 

EVERYDAY IS LIKE SUNDAY

Trudging slowly over wet sand
back to the bench
where your clothes were stolen
this is the coastal town
that they forgot to close down
Armageddon - come Armageddon!
Come Armageddon! Come!
Everyday is like Sunday
everyday is silent and grey
Hide on the promenade
scratch out a postcard
"how I dearly with I was not here"
in the seaside town
...that they forgot to bomb
Come! Come! Come - nuclear bomb!
Everyday is like Sunday
everyday is silent and grey
Trudging back over pebbles and sand
and a strange dust lands on your hands
(and on your face)
Everyday is like Sunday
"Win Yourself A Cheap Tray"
share some greased tea with me
everyday is silent and grey

 

BENGALI IN PLATFORMS

No no no
he does not want to depress you
oh no no no no no
he only wants to impress you
Bengali in platform
she only wants to embrace your culture
and to be your friend forever
Bengali, Bengali
oh shelve your Western plans
and understand that life is hard enough when you belong here
A silver-studded rim that glistens
and an ankle-star that...blinds me
a lemon sole so very high
which only reminds me, to tell you
so I break the news gently
I break the news to you gently
"Shelve your plans"
Bengali, Bengali
its the touchy march of time
that blinds you
don't blame me
don't hate me
just because I'm the one to tell you
that life is hard enough when you belong here
life is hard enough when you belong here
shelve your western plans
life is hard enough when you belong here

 

ANGEL, ANGEL, DOWN WE GO TOGETHER

Angel, Angel
don't take your life tonight
I know they take
and that they take in turn
and they give you nothing real
for yourself in return
and when they've used you
and they've broken you
and wasted all your money
and cast your shell aside
and when they've bought you
and they've sold you
and they've billed you for the pleasure
and they've made your parents cry
I will be here
BELIEVE ME
I will be here
...believe me
Angel, don't take your life
some people have got no pride
they do not understand
the Urgency of life
but I love you more than life
I love you more than life
I love you more than life
I love you more than life

 

LALE NIGHT, MAUDLIN STREET

The last night on Maudlin Street
goodbye house
goodbye stairs
I was born here
I was raised here, and
...I took some stick here
love at first sight
may sound trite
but it's true, you know
I could list the details
of everything you ever wore
or said, or how you stood that day
and as we spend the last night
on Maudlin Street, I say
"goodbye house-forever!"
I never stole a happy hour
around here
Where the world's ugliest boy
became what you see
here I am - the ugliest man
Its the last night on Maudlin Street
and truly I do love you
oh, truly I do love you
When I sleep with that picture of
you framed beside my bed
oh, it's childish and it's silly
but I think it's you in my room
by the bed (...yes, I told you it was silly...)
and I know
I took strange pills
but I never meant to hurt you
oh truly I love you
I came home late one night
everyone had gone to bed
nobody stays up for you
when you have sixteen stitches
all around your head
the last buss I missed to Maudlin Street
so, he drove me home in the Van
complaining: "Women only like me for my mind..."
don't leave your torch behind
power-cuts ahead
as we crept through the park
but no I cannot steal a pair of jeans
off a clothesline for you
but you...without clothes
oh I could not keep a straight face
me - without clothes?
well a nation turns its back and gags...
I'm packed
I am moving house
a half-life disappears today
every slag waves me on
(secretly wishing me gone
well, I will be soon
oh - I will be soon)
There were bad times on Maudlin Street
when they took you away in a police car
dear Inspector - don't you know?
don't you care?
don't you know - about Love?
Your gran died
and your mother died
on Maudlin Street
in pain and ashamed
with never time to say
those special things
I took the keys from Maudlin Street
well, it's only bricks and mortar!
and...truly I do love you
wherever you are
wherever you are

 

SUEDHEAD

Why do you come here
why do you hang around
I'm so sorry
I'm so sorry
Why do you come here
when you know it makes
things hard for me
when you know, oh
why do you come?
Why do you telephone?
and why send me silly notes?
I'm so sorry
I'm so sorry
why do you come here
when you know it makes
thing hard for me
when you know, oh
why do you come?
You had to sneak into my room
'just' to read my diary
was it just to see all the things
you knew I'd written about you?
and...so many illustrations
I'm so very sickened
oh, I am so sickened NOW

 

BREAK UP THE FAMILY

The strange logic of your clumsiest line
stayed emblazoned on my mind
break up the family
and lets begin to live our lives
I went to see all my friends tonight
it wasn't Youth, it wasn't even Life
born Old, sadly wise
resigned (well, we were)
to ending our lives
I'm so glad to grow older
to move away from those awful times
I want to see all my friends tonight
Yes you found love but you weren't
at peace with your life
home late, full of Hate
despise the ties that bind
oh I'm so glad to grow older
to move away from those younger years
now I'm in love for the first time
and I don't feel bad
Let me see all my old friends
let me put my arm around them
because I really do love them
now, does that sound mad?
Captain of games, solid framed
I stood on the touchline
hailstones, driven home
in his car - no breaks? I don't mind
I'm just so glad to grow older
to move away from those darker years
I'm in love for the first time
and I don't feel bad
so wish me luck my friends
goodbye

 

HAIRDRESSER ON FIRE

Here is London
here is London
is it home of the free,
or what?
can you squeeze me
into an empty page of your diary
and psychologically save me
I've got faith in you
I sense the power
in the fingers
within an hour the power
can totally destroy me
or it could same my life
here is London
'home of the brash, outrageous
and free'
you are repressed
but you're remarkably dressed
is it Real?
but you're far to busy
busy scissors
busy clippers
hair dresser on fire
all around Sloane Square
and you're far too busy
to see me
"busy,busy"
hairdresser on fire
was a client over-cautious
he made you nervous
and when he said
"I'm gonna sue you"
I really felt for you
so can you squeeze me
into an empty page of your diary
and supernaturally change me
CHANGE ME, CHANGE ME

 

THE ORDINARY BOYS

Ordinary boys, happy knowing nothing
happy being no one, but themselves
Ordinary girls, supermarket clothes
who think it's very clever to be cruel to you
for you were so different
you stood all alone
and you knew
that it had to be so
avoiding ordinary boys
happy going nowhere, just around here
in their rattling cars
and ordinary girls
never seeing further
than the cold, small streets
that trap them
but you were so different
you had to say no
when those empty fools
tried to change you, and claim you
for the lair of their ordinary world
where they feel so lucky
so lucky, so lucky
with their lives laid out before them
they're so lucky, so lucky
so lucky, so lucky

 

I DON'T MIND IF YOU FORGET ME

I don't mind
I don't mind if you forget me
having learned my lesson
I never left an impression on anyone
so now you send me your hardened 'regards'
when once you'd send me 'love'
sincerely I must tell you
your mild 'best wishes'
they make me suspicious
but I don't mind
I don't mind if you forget me
having learned my lesson
I never left
an impression on anyone
the pressure to change, to move on
was strange
and very strong
so this is why I tell you
I really do understand
BYE BYE
I don't mind if you forget me
no no no no no no no
REJECTION IS ONE THING
BUT REJECTION FROM A FOOL
IS CRUEL
REJECTION IS ONE THING
BUT REJECTION FROM A FOOL
IS CRUEL
and I don't mind if you forget me
I don't mind if your forget me

 

DIAL-A-CLICHE

Further into the fog I fall
well, I was just
following you!
when you said:
"Do as I do and scrap your fey ways"
(dial-a-cliche)
"grow up, be a man, and close your mealy-mouth!"
(dial-a-cliche)
But the person underneath
where does he go?
does he slide by the wayside?
or...does he just die?
when you find that you've organized
your feelings, for people
who didn't like you then
and certainly don't like you now
yet still you say:
"Do as I do and scrap your fey ways"
(dial-a-cliche)
"grow up, be a man, and close your mealy-mouth!"
(dial-a-cliche)
"the Safe way is the only way!
there's always time to change, son!"
yes well I've changed
but I'm in pain!
dial-a-chiche

 

MARGARET ON THE GUILLOTINE

The kind people
have a wonderful dream
Margaret on the guillotine
because people like you
make me feel so tired
when will you die?
when will you die?
when will you die?
when will you die?
when will you die?
because people like you
make me feel so old inside
please die
and kind people
do not shelter this dream
make it real
make the dream real
make the dream real
make it real

 

OUR FRANK

Our frank and open
deep conversations
they get me nowhere
they bring me down, so
give it a rest, won't you?
give me a cigarette
God give me patience
just no more conversation
Give us a drink
and make it quick
or else I'm gonna be sick
sick all over
your frankly vulgar
red pullover
now see how the colours blend
Our frank and open
deep conversations
they get me nowhere
they bring me down, so
give it a rest, won't you?
now will you just give over
the world may be ending
but look, I'm only human
Give us a drink
and make it quick
or else I'm gonna be sick
all over
your frankly vulgar
red pullover
now see how the two colours blend
Won't somebody stop me
from thinking all the time
about everything
so deeply
so bleakly

 

ASIAN RUT

Day oh so late
strangely the sun still shone
oh Asian boy
what are you on?
Day oh so late
strangely the sun still shone
what drugs are you on?
Tooled-up Asian boy
has come here to avenge
the cruel, cold killing
of his very best friend
Tooled-up Asian boy
has come here to take revenge
for the cruel, cold killing
of his only friend
Peace through the school
so quiet in the hall
it's a strange sign for one
of what's to come
Tough and hard and pale
oh they may just impale you on railings
oh English boys
it must be wrong
three against one?
Brakes slammed, and
a gun jammed, and
as far as I could tell
brave Asian boy
dealt a blow and fell
I'm just passing through here
on my way to somewhere civilised
and maybe I'll even arrive
maybe I'll even arrive?

 

SING YOUR LIFE

Sing your life
any fool can think of words that rhyme
many others do
why don't you?
do you want to?
Sing your life
just walk right up to the microphone
and name
all the things that you love
all the things that you loathe
sing your life
all the things that you love
all the things that you loathe
oh sing your life
oh sing your life
Others sang your life
but now's your chance to shine
and have the pleasure of
saying what you mean
the rare pleasure of
meaning what you sing
oh, make no mistake, my friend
all of this will end
so sing it now
all the things you love
all the things you loathe
oh sing your life
all the things that you love
all the things that you loathe
oh sing your, oh sing your
Don't leave it all unsaid
somewhere in the wasteland of your head
and make no mistake, my friend
your pointless life will end
but before you go
can you look at the truth?
You have a lovely singing voice
a lovely singing voice
and all of those
who sing on key
they stole the notion
from you and me

 

MUTE WITNESS

Your poor witness
crying so loudly on the floor
oh but she's only trying to tell you
what it was that she saw
she is only trying to tell you
what it was that she saw
Now see her standing on the table
with her small arms flailing
and you feel such compassion
in your soul for
Your poor mute witness
still testing the strength
of our patience
oh but she's only trying to tell you
what it was that she saw
Now see her pointing to the frisbee
with a memory too fuzzy
as her silent words
describe the fright of last night
4 a.m. Norhtside, Clapham Common
who knows what she was doing there?
will she sketch the answer later?
Well, I'll ask her
"now dry your tears, my dear"
Now see her mime in time so nicely
it would all have been so clear
is only she had never volunteered
"your taxi is here, my dear"

 

KING LEER

Your boyfriend, he
went down on one knee
well, could it be
he's only got one knee?
I tried to surprise you
with Vodka
or, Tizer
I can't quite remember
but you didn't thank me
you didn't even thank me
because you never do
Your boyfriend, he
has the gift of the gab
or, could it be
the gift of the grab?
I tried to surprise you
I lay down beside you
and...nothing much happened
and you didn't phone me
you didn't even phone me
because it's not your style
to dial
Your boyfriend, he
displays to me
more than just
a hint of cruelty
I tried to surprise you
I crept up behind you
with a homeless chihuahua
you gushed for an hour
you handed him back and said
"You'll never guess
I'm bored now"

 

FOUND FOUND FOUND

found found found found found found
someone who's worth it
in this murkiness
someone who's never
seeming scheming
found found found found found found
someone who's worth it
in this murkiness
someone who's never
seeming scheming
Oh, but if I'd never found
oh, but if I'd never found
oh, but if I'd never found
I do believe that
the more you give your love
and I do believe that
the more you offer trust
the more you chase
the more you cry
the more you're bound to lose
the more you're bound to lose
Oh, but if I'd never found
oh, but if I'd never found
somebody
who wants to be
who wants to be
with me
all the time

 

DRIVING YOUR GIRLFRIEND HOME

I'm driving
your girlfriend home
and she's saying
how she never chose you
"turn left", she says
so I turn left
and she says
"So how did I end up
so deeply involved in
the very existence
I planned on avoiding?"
and I can't answer
I'm driving
your girlfriend home
and she's laughing
to stop herself crying
"drive on", she says
so I drive on
and she says
"So how did I end up
attached to this person
when his sense of humour
gets gradually worser?"
and I can't tell her
I'm parking
outside her home
and we're shaking hands
goodnight, so politely

 

THE HARSH TRUTH OF THE CAMERA EYE

Churchillian legs
hair barely there
the harsh truth of the camera eye
Your eyes signal pain
because of the strain
of smiling
the harsh truth of the camera eye
telling you all
that you never wnated to know
showing what
you didn't want shown
My so friendly lens
zooms into
"the inner you"
and it tells the harsh truth
and nothing but
Laugh with us all here
that's if you can
then take the pictures home
and screamtelling you all
that you never wanted to know
showing you what
you didn't want shown
This photographer
he must have really had it in for you
"Oh, I don't want
to be judged anymore
I don't wnat to be judged
I would sooner be Loved
I would sooner be
just blindly Loved..."

 

(I'M) THE END OF THE FAMILY LINE

With no complications
fifteen generations
(of mine)
all honouring Nature
until I arrive
(with incredible style)
I'm the end fo the line
the end of the family line
the end of the line
No baby pulled screaming
out into this seething whirl
by chance or whim
(or even love?)
our family tree hacked into decline
and I'm spared the pain
of ever saying
("goodbye")
I'm the end of the line
the end of the family line
the end of the line

 

THERE'S A PLACE IN HELL FOR ME AND MY FRIENDS

There is a place
reserved
for me and my friends
and when we go
we all will go
so you see
I'm never alone
there is a place
with a bit more time
and a few more
gentler words
and looking back
we do forgive
(we had no choice
we always did)
all that we hope
is that when we go
our skin
and our blood
and our bones
don't get in your way
making you ill
the way they did
when we lived
There is a place
a place in hell
reserved
for me and my friends
and if ever I
wanted to cry
then I will
because I can

 

TONY THE PONY

Still drinking on the corner 
Just don't say I didn't warn you 
Always nagging big brother 
He's only looking out for you 
Tony The Pony 
Tony The Pony 
You're still standing on the corner 
Just don't say I didn't warn you 
Old and jealous big brother 
You had your time and you spent it 
Crying 
Now, Tony The Pony 
Tony The Pony 
So, that's what they call you now ? 
When you're free outside 
So cold and hard and in control 
And ... 
There's a free ride on 
Tony The Pony 
Oh, why do you always wanna stop me 
From doing the things in life that make me happy ? 
And when I'm outside with friends, laughing loudly 
Why do you always wanna stop me ? 
Oh, I would never 
I would never 
But you will carry the can for anyone 
The free ride on 
Gullible Tony 
You're drunker quicker 
And you're sicker even quicker 
For something heavy is gonna fall on you 
Oh ... 
And what do they call you now ? 
When you're free outside 
So cold and hard and in control 
And, oh ... been a lark 
There's a free ride on 
Fucked-up Tony 
I will never say I told you so 
Or how I knew that something bad 
Would happen to you 
I don't wanna say I told you so 
Oh, but Tony, I told you so !!! 
I told you so

 

YOU'RE GONNA NEED SOMEONE ON YOUR SIDE

With the world's fate 
Resting on your shoulder 
You're gonna need 
Someone on your side 
You can't do it by yourself 
Any longer 
You're gonna need 
Someone on your side 
Someone kindly told me 
That you'd wasted 
Eight of nine lives
Oh, give yourself a break 
Before you break down 
You're gonna need someone on your side 
And here I am, And here I am 
Well, you don't need 
To look so pleased ! 
Day or night, 
There is no difference 
You're gonna need someone on your side 
Day or night, 
There is no difference 
You're gonna need someone soon 
And here I am, And here I am 
Well, you don't need 
To look so pleased

 

GLAMOROUS GLUE

First day with the jar 
You find 
Everyone lies 
First day with the jar 
You find 
Everyone lies, nobody minds 
Everyone lies 
Where is the man you respect ? 
And where is the woman you love ? 
Where's the woman you love ? 
Third week with the jar
You find 
Everything dies 
We won't vote Conservative 
Because we never have 
Everyone lies, everyone lies 
Where is the man you respect ? 
And where is the woman you love ? 
Where's the woman you love ? 
Everything of worth 
On Earth Is there To share 
I used to dream, and I used to vow 
I wouldn't dream of it now 
We look to Los Angeles 
For the language we use 
London is dead, London is dead, London is dead...
Now I'm too much in love 
I'm too much in love 
I know 
I'll go 
Empty hand 
From the land

 

WE'LL LET YOU KNOW

How sad are we ? 
And how sad have we been ? 
We'll let you know 
We'll let you know 
Oh, but only if - you're really interested 
You wonder how 
We've stayed alive 'till now 
We'll let you know 
We'll let you know 
But only if - you're really interested 
We're all smiles 
Then, honest, I swear, it's the turnstiles 
That make us hostile 
Oh ... 
We will descend 
On anyone unable to defend 
Themselves 
Oh ... 
And the songs we sing 
They're not supposed to mean a thing 
La, la, la, la ... 
Oh ...You're lonely, Oh ... you're lonely, Oh ... 
GET OFF THE ROOF ! Oh ... 
Your Arsenal !
We may seem cold, or 
We may even be 
The most depressing people you've ever known 
At heart, what's left, we sadly know 
That we are the last truly British people you'll ever know 
We are the last truly British people you will ever know 
You'll never never want to know

 

THE NATIONAL FRONT DISCO

David, the wind blows 
The wind blows ... 
Bits of your life away 
Your friends all say ... 
"Where is our boy ? Oh, we've lost our boy" 
But they should know 
Where you've gone 
Because again and again you've explained that 
You're going to ... 
Oh, you're going to ... 
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah 
England for the English ! 
England for the English ! 
David, the winds blow 
The winds blow ...
All of my dreams away 
And I still say : 
"Where is our boy ? Ah, we've lost our boy" 
But I should know 
Why you've gone 
Because again and again you've explained
You've gone to the ... 
National, ah ... 
To the National .. 
There's a country; you don't live there 
But one day you would like to 
And if you show them what you're made of 
Oh, then you might do ... 
But David, we wonder 
We wonder if the thunder 
Is ever really gonna begin 
Begin, begin 
Your mom says : 
"I've lost my boy" 
But she should know 
Why you've gone 
Because again and again you've explained 
You've gone to the : 
National 
To the National 
To the National Front Disco 
Because you want the day to come sooner 
You want the day to come sooner 
You want the day to come sooner 
When you've settled the score 
Oh, the National 
Oh, the National

 

CERTAIN PEOPLE I KNOW

I take the cue from 
Certain people I know 
I use the cue 
And then I 
Hand it on to you 
And when I swing it 
So, it catches his eye ... 
(Weren't you there ? 
- You'd have died !) 
I trust the views of 
Certain people I know 
They look at Danger 
And they 
LAUGH THEIR HEADS OFF 
Their clothes are Imitation 
George the 23rd 
(Don't you find this absurd ?) 
I'd hate to be like 
Certain people I know 
They break their necks 
And can't afford to
Get them fixed 
Ah, they'd sacrifice all 
Of their principles for 
anything cashable 
I do believe it's terrible 
Oh, wo, wo, Ah, ah, ah, ah, Oh, wo, wo...

 

WE HATE IT WHEN OUR FRIENDS BECOME SUCCESSFUL

We hate it when our friends become successful 
We hate it when our friends become successful 
Oh, look at those clothes 
Now look at that face, it's so old 
And such a video ! 
Well, it's really laughable 
Ha, ha, ha ...
We hate it when our friends become successful 
And if they're Northern, that makes it even worse
And if we can destroy them 
You bet your life we will 
Destroy them 
If we can hurt them 
Well, we may as well ... 
It's really laughable 
Ha, ha, ha ... 
You see, it should've been me 
It could've been me 
Everybody knows 
Everybody says so 
They say :

So many songs

SEASICK, YET STILL DOCKED

I am a poor freezingly cold soul 
So far from where 
I intended to go 
Scavenging through life's very constant lulls 
So far from where I'm determined to go 
Wish I knew the way to reach the one I love
There is no way ... 
Wish I had the charm to attract the one I love 
But you see, I've got no charm 
Mmm...
Tonight I've consumed much more than I can hold 
Oh, this is very clear to you 
And you can tell I have never really loved 
You can tell, by the way, I sleep all day
And all of my life no-one gave me anything 
No-one has ever given me anything 
My love is as sharp as a needle in your eye 
You must be such a fool 
To pass me by

 

I KNOW IT'S GONNA HAPPEN SOMEDAY

My love, wherever you are 
Whatever you are 
Don't lose faith 
I know it's gonna happen someday 
To you 
Please wait ... Please wait ... Oh ... Wait ... 
Don't lose faith 
You say that the day just never arrives 
And it's never seemed so far away 
Still, I know it's gonna happen someday 
To you 
Please wait ... 
Don't lose faith

 

TOMORROW

Tomorrow 
Will it really come ? 
And if it does come 
Will I still be Human ? 
All I ask of you is one thing that you never do 
Would you put your arms around me ? 
(I won't tell anyone) 
Tomorrow 
Does it have to come ?
All I ask of you is one thing that you'll never do 
Would you put your arms around me ? 
(I won't tell anybody) 
Tomorrow 
And what must come before ...
Oh, the pain in my arms 
Oh, the pain in my legs 
Ooh, my shiftless body 
Tomorrow 
It's surely nearer now ? 
You don't think I'll make it 
I never said I wanted to ! 
Well did I ? 
Oh, the pain in my arms 
Oh, the pain in my legs 
Oh, yeah; oh, yeah, No, yeah; no, yeah 
Through my shiftless body 
Tomorrow, Tomorrow 
All I ask of you ... oh ... 
Is : would you tell me that you love me 
Tell me, tell me that you love me, Tell me, tell me that you love me ... 
Ah, I know you don't mean it 
Ah, I know you don't mean it 
Tell me, tell me that you love me, Tell me, tell me that you love me ...

NOVEMBER SPAWNED A MONSTER

Sleep on and dream of Love
because it's the closest you will get to love
poor twisted child, so ugly, so ugly
poor twisted child, oh hug me, oh hug me
one November spawned a monster 
in the shape of this child who later cried
"But Jesus made me, so Jesus save me from
pity, sympathy and people discussing me"
a frame of useless limbs what can make GOOD
all the BAD that's been done?
And if the lights were out
could you even bear
to kiss her full on the mouth (or anywhere?)
poor twisted child, so ugly, so ugly
poor twisted child, oh hug me, oh hug me
one November spawned a monster 
in the shape of this child who must remain
a hostage to kindess and the wheels underneath her
a hostage to kindess and the wheels underneath her
a symbol of where mad, mad lovers
must PAUSE and draw the line
So sleep and dream of love
because it's the closest
you will get to love
that November is a time which I must put OUT of my mind
oh one fine day 
LET IT BE SOON
she won't be rich or beautiful
but she'll be walking your streets
in the clothes that she went out
and chose for herself

 

SEASICK, YET STILL DOCKED

I am a poor freezingly cold soul 
So far from where 
I intended to go 
Scavenging through life's very constant lulls 
So far from where I'm determined to go 
Wish I knew the way to reach the one I love
There is no way ... 
Wish I had the charm to attract the one I love 
But you see, I've got no charm 
Mmm...
Tonight I've consumed much more than I can hold 
Oh, this is very clear to you 
And you can tell I have never really loved 
You can tell, by the way, I sleep all day
And all of my life no-one gave me anything

You must be such a fool 
To pass me by

 

THE LOOP

I just wanna say 
I haven't been away 
I'm still right here 
Where I always was 
So one day, if you're bored 
By all means call 
Because you can do 
(But only if you want to) 
I just wanna say 
I haven't been away 
I am still right here 
Where I always was

By all means call

SISTER I'M A POET

All over this town 
Yes, a low wind may blow 
And I can see through everybo... 
With no reason 
To hide these words I feel 
And no reason 
To talk about the books I read 
But still I do 
That's 'cause I'm a ... Sister I'm a ... 
All over this town 
Along this way 
Outside the prison gates 
I love the romance of crime 
And I wonder 
Does anybody feel the way I do ? 
And is evil just something you are 
Or something you do ? 
Sister I'm a ... Sister I'm a ... 
All over this town, All over this town 
They pull over 
In their Citroen vans 
Not to shake your hand 
With meths on their breaths 
And you with youth on your side 
A plastic bag stranded at the lights 
This once was me ...
But now I'm a ... Sister I'm a ...
All over this town ... Oh, oh, oh 
All over this town, All over this town, Oh ... 
I still cannot speak French ... I am very lazy

 

JACK THE RIPPER

Oh, you look so tired 
Mouth slack and wide 
Ill-housed and ill-advised 
Your face is as mean 
As your life has been 
Crash into my arms 
I WANT YOU 
You don't agree -
But you don't refuse 
I know you 
And I know a place 
Where no one is likely to pass 
Oh, you don't care if it's late 
And you don't care if you're lost 
And oh, you look so tired 
(But tonight you presumed too much) 
Too much, too much 
And if it's the last 
Thing I ever do 
I'M GONNA GET YOU 
Crash into my arms 
I WANT YOU 
You don't agree -
But you don't refuse 
I know you 
And no one knows a thing about my life 
I can come and go as I please 
And if I want to, I can stay 
Oh, or if I want to, I can leave 
Nobody knows me, Nobody knows me, Nobody knows me Oh, oh...

 

SUCH A LITTLE THING MAKES SUCH A BIG DIFFERENCE

Such a little thing, such a little thing
but the difference it made was grave
there you go
wielding a bicycle chain
oh why won't you change
cange and be nicer?
such a little thing
a gentle tone of kindness
or written words on paper
- can you write?
How I love all of
the very simple things of life
(God's good air)
how I love all of
the very simple things of life
such a little thing
a fumbling politeness
the difference it saved me
wielding a bicycle chain
"I WILL NOT CHANGE AND I WILL NOT BE NICE"
Most people keep their brains between your legs (don't you find?)
Leave me alone - I was only singing, leave me alone because
I was only singing
leave me alone - I was only singing, leave me alone
you have just proved (again)
MOST PEOPLE KEEP THEIR BRAINS BETWEEN THEIR LEGS

 

I KNOW IT'S GONNA HAPPEN SOMEDAY

My love, wherever you are 
Whatever you are 
Don't lose faith 
I know it's gonna happen someday 
To you 
Please wait ... 
Please wait ... 
Oh ... Wait ... 
Don't lose faith 
You say that the day just never arrives 
And it's never seemed so far away 
Still, I know it's gonna happen someday 
To you 
Please wait ... 
Don't lose faith

 

WE'LL LET YOU KNOW

How sad are we ? 
And how sad have we been ? 
We'll let you know, We'll let you know 
Oh, but only if - you're really interested 
You wonder how 
We've stayed alive 'till now 
We'll let you know, We'll let you know 
But only if - you're really interested 
We're all smiles 
Then, honest, I swear, it's the turnstiles 
That make us hostile 
Oh ... We will descend 
On anyone unable to defend 
Themselves 
Oh ... And the songs we sing 
They're not supposed to mean a thing 
La, la, la, la ... Oh ...
You're lonely, Oh ... you're lonely 
Oh ... 
GET OFF THE ROOF !
Oh ... Your Arsenal !
We may seem cold, or 
We may even be 
The most depressing people you've ever known 
At heart, what's left, we sadly know 
That we are the last truly British people you'll ever know 
We are the last truly British people you will ever know 
You'll never never want to know

 

SUEDHEAD

Why do you come here
why do you hang around
I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry
Why do you come here
when you know it makes
things hard for me
when you know, oh
why do you come?
Why do you telephone?
and why send me silly notes?
I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry
why do you come here
when you know it makes
thing hard for me
when you know, oh
why do you come?
You had to sneak into my room
'just' to read my diary
was it just to see all the things
you knew I'd written about you?
and...so many illustrations
I'm so very sickened
oh, I am so sickened NOW

 

HE KNOWS I'D LOVE TO SEE HIM

He Knows (he knows)
Or, I think he does
because when I lived
in the Arse of the world...
he knows, he knows, he knows I'd love
to see him happy (or as close as is allowed)
because when I lived
in the Arse of the world
he knows, he knows, he knows I'd love
to see him happy (or as close as possible
as close as possible, as close as is allowed)
My name still conjours up deadly deeds
and a bad taste in the mouth
the police - they actually knew me
they said:
"You're just another person in the world
you're just another fool with radical views
you're just another who has maddening views
you want to turn it on its head
by staying in bed!"
I said: "I know I do"

 

YOU'RE GONNA NEED SOMEONE ON YOUR SIDE

With the world's fate 
Resting on your shoulder 
You're gonna need 
Someone on your side 
You can't do it by yourself 
Any longer 
You're gonna need 
Someone on your side 
Someone kindly told me 
That you'd wasted 
Eight of nine lives
Oh, give yourself a break 
Before you break down 
You're gonna need someone on your side 
And here I am, And here I am 
Well, you don't need 
To look so pleased ! 
Day or night, 
There is no difference 
You're gonna need someone on your side 
Day or night, 
There is no difference 
You're gonna need someone soon 
And here I am, And here I am 
Well, you don't need 
To look so pleased

 

GLAMOROUS GLUE

First day with the jar 
You find 
Everyone lies 
First day with the jar 
You find 
Everyone lies, nobody minds, Everyone lies 
Where is the man you respect ? 
And where is the woman you love ? 
Where's the woman you love ? 
Third week with the jar
You find 
Everything dies 
We won't vote Conservative 
Because we never have 
Everyone lies, everyone lies 
Where is the man you respect ? 
And where is the woman you love ? 
Where's the woman you love ? 
Everything of worth 
On Earth, Is there, To share 
I used to dream, and I used to vow 
I wouldn't dream of it now 
We look to Los Angeles 
For the language we use 
London is dead, London is dead, London is dead, ...
Now I'm too much in love 
I'm too much in love, 
I know I'll go 
Empty hand 
From the land

Destroy them

NOW MY HEART IS FULL

There's gonna be some trouble 
A whole house will need re-building 
And everyone I love in the house 
Will recline on an analyst's couch quite 
Soon 
Your Father cracks a joke 
And in the usual way 
Empties the room 
Tell all of my friends 
(I don't have too many 
Just some rain-coated lovers' puny brothers)
Dallow, Spicer, Pinkie, Cubitt 
Rush to danger 
Wind up nowhere 
Patric Doonan - raised to wait 
I'm tired again, I've tried again, and 
Now my heart is full 
Now my heart is full 
And I just can't explain 
So I won't even try to
Dallow, Spicer, Pinkie, Cubitt 
Every jammy Stressford poet 
Loafing oafs in all-night chemists 
Loafing oafs in all-night chemists 
Underact - express depression 
Ah, but Bunnie I loved you 
I was tired again 
I've tried again, and 
Now my heart is full 
Now my heart is full 
And I just can't explain 
So I won't even try to 
Could you pass by ? 
Could you pass by ? 
Oh ... 
Now my heart is full 
Now my heart is full 
And I just can't explain 
So ... slow ... 
Slow ... slow ... slow ... slow ... slow ...

 

SPRING-HEELED JIM

Spring-heeled Jim winks an eye 
He'll "do", he'll never be "done to" 
He takes on whoever flew through 
"Well, it's the normal thing to do" ... ah ... 
Spring-heeled Jim lives to love 
Now kissing with his mouth full 
And his eyes on some other fool 
So many women 
His head should be spinning 
Ah, but no ! 
Ah, but no ! 
But no !
Ah, no !
Spring-heeled Jim slurs the words : 
"There's no need to be so knowing
Take life at five times the 
Average speed, like I do" 
Until Jim feels the chill 
"Oh, where did all the time go ?" 
Once always in for the kill 
Now it's too cold 
And he feels too 
old 
Too old
Mmm, old... 
La, la, la, la-la, la ...

 

BILLY BUDD

Say, Billy Budd 
So you think you should ? 
Oh, everyone's laughing 
Say, Billy Budd 
So you think that you should ? 
Everyone's laughing ! 
Since I took up with you 
Things have been bad 
Yeah, but now it's 12 years on 
Now it's 12 years on 
Yes, and I took up with you 
I took my job application 
Into town 
Did you hear ? They turned me down 
Yes, and it's all because of us 
Oh, and what was in our eyes 
Oh, what was in our eyes, yeah 
I said, Billy Budd 
I would happily lose 
Both of my legs 
I would lose both of my legs 
Oh, if it meant you could be free 
Oh, if it meant you could be free 
(Don't leave us in the dark!)

 

HOLD ON TO YOUR FRIENDS

A bond of trust 
Has been abused 
Something of value 
May be lost 
Give up your job 
Squander your cash - be rash 
Just hold on to your friends 
There are more than enough 
To fight and oppose 
Why waste good time 
Fighting the people you like 
Who will fall defending your name 
Oh, don't feel so ashamed 
To have friends 
But now you only call me 
When you're feeling depressed 
When you feel happy I'm 
So far from your mind 
My patience is stretched 
My loyalty vexed 
Oh, you're losing all of your friends 
Hold on to your friends 
Hold on to your friends 
Resist - or move on 
Be mad, be rash 
Smoke and explode 
Sell all of your clothes 
Just bear in mind : 
Oh, there just might come a time 
When you need some friends

 

THE MORE YOU IGNORE ME, THE CLOSER I GET

The more you ignore me 
The closer I get 
You're wasting your time 
The more you ignore me 
The closer I get 
You're wasting your time 
I will be 
In the bar 
With my head 
On the bar 
I am now 
A central part 
Of your mind's landscape 
Whether you care 
Or do not 
Yeah, I've made up your mind 
The more you ignore me 
The closer I get 
You're wasting your time 
The more you ignore me 
The closer I get 
You're wasting your time 
Beware !
I bear more grudges 
Than lonely high court judges 
When you sleep 
I will creep 
Into your thoughts 
Like a bad debt 
That you can't pay 
Take the easy way 
And give in 
Yeah, and let me in 
Oh, let me in 
Oh let me ... 
Oh, let me in 
IT'S WAR 
IT'S WAR 
WAR 
WAR 
Oh, let me in 
Ah, the closer I get 
Ah, you're asking for it 
Ah, the closer I get 
Ooh, the closer I ...

 

WHY DON'T YOU FIND OUT FOR YOURSELF

The sanest days are mad 
Why don't you find out for yourself ? 
Then you'll see the price 
Very closely 
Some men here 
They have a special interest 
In your career 
They wanna help you to grow 
And then syphon all your dough 
Why don't you find out for yourself ? 
Then you'll see the glass 
Hidden in the grass 
You'll never believe me, so 
Why don't you find out for yourself ? 
Sick down to my heart 
That's just the way it goes 
Some men here 
They know the full extent of 
Your distress 
They kneel and pray 
And they say : 
"Long may it last" 
Why don't you find out for yourself ?
Then you'll see the glass 
Hidden in the grass 
Bad scenes come and go 
For which you must allow 
Sick down to my heart 
That's just the way it goes 
Don't rake up my mistakes 
I know exactly what they are 
And ... what do YOU do ? 
Well ... you just SIT THERE 
I've been stabbed in the back 
So many many times 
I don't have any skin 
But that's just the way it goes

 

I AM HATED FOR LOVING

I am hated for loving 
I am hated for loving 
Anonymous call, a poison pen 
A brick in the small of the back again 
I still don't belong 
To anyone - I am mine 
And I am hated for loving 
I am haunted for wanting 
Anonymous call, a poison pen 
A brick in the ... ah ... 
A brick in the small of the back again 
I still don't belong 
To anyone - I am mine 
I am falling 
With no-one to catch me 
I am falling 
And there's still 
No-one to catch me 
Ah .. 
Anonymous call, a poison pen 
A brick in the ... ah ... 
A brick in the small of the back again 
I just don't belong 
To anywhere 
I just don't belong 
Mmm ... 
Ah ...

 

LIFEGUARD SLEEPING, GIRL DROWNING

Always looking for attention 
Always needs to be mentioned 
Who does she 
Think she should be ? 
The shrill cry through darkening air 
Doesn't she know he's 
Had such a busy day ? 
Tell her ... sshhh
Somebody tell her ... sshhh 
Slowest ... 
It was only a test 
But she swam too far 
Against the tide 
She deserves all she gets 
The sky became marked with stars 
As an out-stretched arm slowly 
Disappears 
Hooray 
Oh hooray 
No, oh, oh, woh, there's no movement 
No, oh, hooray 
Oh, hooray 
Please don't worry 
There'll be no fuss 
She was ... nobody's nothing 
(What's your name ?) 
When he awoke 
The sea was calm 
And another day passes like a dream 
There's no ... no way 
(What's your name ?)

 

USED TO BE A SWEET BOY

Used to be a sweet boy 
Holding so tightly 
To Daddy's hand 
But that was all 
In some distant land 
Blazer and tie 
And a big bright healthy smile 
Used to make all 
Of our trials worthwhile 
Used to be a sweet boy 
And I'm not to blame 
Something went wrong 
And I know 
I'm not to blame 
Something went wrong 
Can't be to blame 
Ah ...

 

THE LAZY SUNBATHERS

A world war 
Was announced 
Days ago 
But they didn't know 
The lazy sunbathers 
The lazy sunbathers 
The sun burns through 
To the planet's core 
And it isn't enough 
They want more 
Nothing 
Appears 
To be 
Between the ears of 
The lazy sunbathers 
Too jaded 
To question stagnation 
The sun burns through 
To the planet's core 
And it isn't enough 
They want more 
Religions fall 
Children shelled 
"...Children shelled ? That's all 
Very well, but would you 
Please keep the noise 
Down low ? 
Because you're waking 
The lazy sunbathers ..."
Oh, the lazy sunbathers 
The lazy sunbathers

 

SPEEDWAY

And when you slam 
Down the hammer 
Can you see it in your heart ? 
All of the rumours 
Keeping me grounded 
I never said, I never said that they were 
Completely unfounded 
So when you slam 
Down the hammer 
Can you see it in your heart ? 
Can you delve so low ? 
And when you're standing 
On my fingers 
Can you see it in your heart ? ... ah ... 
And when you try 
To break my spirit 
It won't work 
Because there's nothing left to break 
Anymore 
All of the rumours 
Keeping me grounded 
I never said, I never said that they were 
Completely unfounded 
You won't sleep 
Until the earth that wants me 
Finally has me 
Oh you've done it now 
You won't rest 
Until the hearse that becomes me 
Finally takes me 
Oh you've done it now 
And you won't smile 
Until my loving mouth 
Is shut good and proper 
FOREVER 
All of the rumours 
Keeping me grounded 
I never said, I never said that they were 
Completely unfounded 
And all those lies 
Written lies, twisted lies 
Well, they weren't lies 
They weren't lies 
They weren't lies 
I never said 
I never said 
I could have mentioned your name 
I could have dragged you in 
Guilt by implication 
By association 
I've always been true to you 
In my own strange way 
I've always been true to you 
In my own sick way 
I'll always stay true to you

 

THE TEACHERS ARE AFRAID OF THE PUPILS

There's too many people 
Planning your downfall 
When your spirit's on trial 
These nights can be frightening 
Sleep transports sadness 
To some other mid-brain 
And somebody here 
Will not be here next year 
So you stand by the board 
Full of fear and intention 
And, if you think that they're listening 
Well, you've got to be joking 
Oh, you understand change 
And you think it's essential 
But when your profession 
Is humiliation 
Say the wrong word to our children ...
We'll have you, oh yes, we'll have you 
Lay a hand on our children 
And it's never too late to have you 
Mucus on your collar 
A nail up through the staff chair 
A blade in your soap 
And you cry into your pillow 
To be finished would be a relief 
To be finished would be a relief... 
Say the wrong word to our children ...
We'll have you, oh yes, we'll have you 
Lay a hand on our children 
And it's never too late to have you 
To be finished would be a relief 
To be finished would be a relief...
I'm very glad this thing has come 
Sometimes I'm so glad 
Never bother to play the tunes 
I've seen it coming for dear life

 

READER MEET AUTHOR

You don't know a thing about their lives 
They live where you wouldn't dare to drive
You shake as you think of how they sleep 
But you write as if you are my side-by-side 
Reader, meet Author 
With the hope of hearing sense 
But you may be feeling let down 
By the words of defence 
He says : "No-one ever sees me when I cry"
You don't know a thing about their lives 
Books don't save them, books aren't Stanley knives 
And if a fight broke out here tonight 
You'd be the first away, because you're that type 
And the Year 2000 won't change anyone here 
As each fabled promise flies so fast 
You'll swear it was never there 
Oh, have you ever escaped from a shipwrecked life ? 
So safely with your software; all miles from the front line 
You hear the way their sad voices, and you start to imagine things 
Oh, any excuse to write more lies

 

THE BOY RACER

He's just too good-natured and 
He's got too much money and 
He's got too many girlfriends 
I'm jealous, that's all 
Have you seen him go, though, oh ?

Boy racer, Boy racer, oh 
We're gonna kill this pretty thing

We're gonna kill this pretty thing 
Boy racer, Boy racer, oh 
We're gonna kill this pretty thing 
He thinks he got the whole world in his hands 
Stood at the urinal 
He thinks he got the whole world in his hands 
And I'm gonna ... kill him !
Oh, no ! Oh, no ! Oh, no ! Oh, no ! Oh, no !Oh .... 
Boy racer Boy racer, oh 
We're gonna kill this pretty thing...
He's just too good-looking, and, And, and ... 
Boy racer Boy racer, oh 
We're gonna kill this pretty thing...

 

THE OPERATION

You fight with your right hand 
And caress with your left hand 
Everyone I know is sick to death of you 
With a tear that's a mile wide 
In the kite that you're flying 
Everyone I know is sick to death of you 
Ever since 
You don't look the same 
You're just not the same, no way 
You say clever things and 
You never used to 
You don't catch what I'm saying 
When you're deafened to advice 
Everyone here is sick to the 
Back teeth of you 
With a tear that's a mile wide 
In the kite that you're flying 
Everyone here is sick to the 
Tattoo of you 
Ever since 
You don't look the same 
You're just not the same, no way 
You say pleasant things and 
There is no need to
Still, you fight with your right hand 
And caress with your left hand 
Ooh, ooh ... Sad to say ... 
How once I was in love with you 
Sad to say ... 
You don't catch what I'm saying 
When you're deafened to advice 
Ooh, ooh ... Ever since 
You don't look the same 
You're just not the same, no way 
What the hell have 
They stuck into you ?

 

DAGENHAM DAVE

Head in the clouds, and a mouthful of pie 
Head in a blouse, everybody loves him 
I see why 
Dagenham Dave, Dagenham Dave, Oh, Dagenham Dave 
Dagenham Dave, Dagenham Dave, Oh, Dagenham Dave 
"I love Karen, I love Sharon" on the windowscreen 
With never the need to fight or to question a single thing 
Dagenham Dave, Dagenham Dave Oh, Dagenham Dave 
Dagenham Dave, Dagenham Dave Oh, Dagenham Dave ...
He'd love to touch, he's afraid that he might self-combust 
I could say more, but you get the general idea

Dagenham, Dagenham Dagenham Dave, Dagenham Dave ...
Oh, Dave, oh, Dagenham, dagenham, Oh, Dave, oh, Dave, ...

 

DO YOUR BEST AND DON'T WORRY

Compare the best of their days 
With the worst of your days 
You won't win 
With your standards so high 
And your spirits so low 
At least remember ... 
This is you on a bad day, you on a pale day 
Just do your best and don't ... Don't worry, oh 
The way you hang yourself is oh, so unfair 
See the best of how they look 
Against the worst of how you are
And again, you won't win 
With your standards so high 
And your spirits so low 
At least remember ... 
This is you on a drab day, you in a drab dress 
Just do your best and don't ... Don't worry, oh 
The way you hang yourself is oh, so unfair 
Just do your best and don't ... Don't worry, oh 
The way you watch yourself is oh, so unfair 
Just do your best and don't ... Don't worry, oh 
Do your best and don't ...

SOUTHPAW

You were a boy before you became a man 
I don't see the joy 
And you ran with your pals in the sun 
You turned around and they were gone 
Again ... 
A sick boy should be treated 
So easily defeated 
Oh, I just don't understand 
So you ran with your pals in the sun 
You turned around 
You were alone 
Again ... 
And you ran back to Ma 
Which set the pace for the rest of your days 
Oh, you ran back to Ma 
Which set the pace for the rest of your days 
Oh, you ran back to Ma 
Which set the pace for the rest of your days 
And now, there is something that you should know 
There is something that you should know 
The girl of your dreams is 
Here all alone 
Girl of your dreams is 
Here all alone 
The girl of your dreams is 
Sad and all alone 
The girl of your dreams is 
Here all alone 
There is something that you should know 
There is something that you should know 
Girl of your dreams is 
Here all alone 
The girl of your dreams is 
Sad and is all alone 
The girl of your dreams is 
Sad and is feeling all alone 
Oh, there is something that you should know 
Help me, help me, help me ...

 

MALADJUSTED

I wanna start from 
Before the beginning 
Loot wine, "Be mine, and 
Then let's stay out for the night"
Ride via Parkside 
Semi-perilous lives 
Jeer the lights in the windows 
Of all safe and stable homes 
(But wondering then, well what 
Could peace of mind be like ?)
Anyway do you want to hear 
Our story, or not ? 
As the Fulham Road lights 
Stretch and invite into the night 
From a Stevenage overspill 
We'd kill to live around 
SW6 - with someone like you 
Keep thieves' hours 
With someone like you 
...As long as it slides 
You stalk the house 
In a low-cut blouse : 
"Oh Christ, another stifled 
Friday night !"
And the Fulham Road lights 
Stretch and invite into the night 
Well, I was fifteen 
What could I know ?
When the gulf between 
All the things I need 
And the things I receive 
Is an ancient ocean 
Wide, wild, lost, uncrossed 
Still I maintain there's nothing 
Wrong with you 
You do all that you do 
Because it's all you can do 
Well, I was fifteen 
Where could I go ?
With a soul full of loathing 
For stinging bureaucracy 
Making it anything 
Other than easy 
For working girls like me 
With my hands on my head 
I flop on your bed 
With a head full of dread 
For all I've ever said 
Maladjusted, maladjusted 
Maladjusted maladjusted 
Never to be trusted 
Oh, never to be trusted 
There's nothing wrong with you, oh 
...There's nothing wrong with you

 

ALMA MATTERS

So : the choice I have made 
May seem strange to you 
But who asked you, anyway ? 
It's my life to wreck 
My own way 
You see : to someone, somewhere, oh yeah ... 
Alma matters 
In mind, body and soul 
In part, and in whole 
Because to someone, somewhere, oh yeah ... 
Alma matters 
In mind, body and soul 
In part, and in whole 
So the life I have made 
May seem wrong to you 
But, I've never been surer 
It's my life to ruin 
My own way 
You see : to someone, somewhere, oh yeah ... 
Alma matters 
In mind, body and soul 
In part, and in whole 
Because to someone, somewhere, oh yeah ... 
Alma matters 
In mind, body and soul 
In part, and in whole 
To someone, somewhere, oh yeah ... 
Alma matters 
In mind, body and soul 
Part, and in whole 
So to someone, somewhere, oh yeah ... 
Alma matters 
In mind, body and soul 
Part, and in whole 
To someone, somewhere, oh yeah ... 
Oh yeah ... Oh yeah, oh yeah Oh yeah ...

 

AMBITIOUS OUTSIDERS

Bolt-lock your doors 
Alarm your cars 
And still we move in closer 
Every day 
Top of the list 
Is your smiling kids 
But we'll be smiling too 
So that's OK 
Oh, and by the way 
Thank you, because you're 
Giving, giving, giving 
And we're receiving - 
No, no, we're taking 
Keeping the population down 
Your taxes paid, but 
Police waylaid 
And we knows 
When the school bus 
Comes and goes 
We're on your street, but 
You don't see us 
Or, if you do 
You smile and say Hello 
BUT DON'T UNDERESTIMATE US 
When you are 
Giving, giving, giving 
And we're receiving - 
No, no, we're taking 
Just keeping 
The population down 
You're giving, giving, giving 
Well, it's your own fault 
For reproducing 
We're just keeping 
The population down

 

TROUBLE LOVES ME

Trouble loves me 
Trouble needs me 
Two things 
More than you do 
Or would attempt to 
So, console me 
Otherwise, hold me 
Just when it seems like 
Everything's evened out 
And the balance 
Seems serene 
Trouble loves me 
Walks beside me 
To chide me 
Not to guide me 
It's still much more 
Than you'll do 
So, console me 
Otherwise, hold me 
Just when it seems like 
Everything's evened out 
And the balance seems serene 
See the fool I'll be 
Still running 'round 
On the flesh rampage 
Still running 'round 
Ready with ready-wit 
Still running 'round 
On the flesh rampage 
- At your age ! 
Go to Soho, oh 
Go to waste in 
The wrong arms 
Still running 'round 
Trouble loves me 
Seeks and finds me 
To charlatanize me 
Which is only 
As it should be 
Oh, please fulfill me 
Otherwise, kill me 
Show me a barrel and watch me scrape it 
Faced with the music, as always I'll face it 
In the half-light 
So English, frowning 
Then at midnight I 
Can't get you out of my head 
A disenchanted taste 
Still running 'round 
A disenchanted taste 
Still running 'round

 

PAPA JACK

Papa Jack 
Wants to turn 
Back the clock 
And reach out 
To the kids 
He once had 
Who have flown 
Papa Jack 
In decline 
Feels inclined 
To reach out 
To the kids 
He once had 
Who have flown 
But there was a time 
When the kids reached up 
And Papa Jack just 
Pushed them away 
Looking deep 
In his heart 
Papa Jack 
Doesn't like 
What he sees 
Or the time 
On his hands 
The dying day 
The chilly sun 
Papa Jack 
All alone 
Sings slow 
Grieving and low 
But there was a time 
When the kids reached up 
Now you can't always 
Have it your way 
Papa Jack 
Ah ...

 

AMMUNITION

I know these roads 
Each ridge 
And narrow bridge 
Each cheveron 
Enticing me on 
Each warning sign 
I take in my stride 
I don't need more ammunition 
I've got more than I can spend 
I don't dwell on things I'm missing 
I'm just pleased 
With the things I've found 
I know these roads 
An old hand understands 
Above all, I know what's 
Expected of me now 
Veering cliffwards 
I don't need more ammunition 
I've got more than I can spend 
I don't dwell on things I'm missing 
I'm just pleased 
With the things I've found 
With the things I've found 
With the things I've found 
I've found 
I've been crying 
It comes back on these salient days 
And it stays 
And it says : 
"We've never really been away" 
I don't need more ammunition 
I've got more than I can spend 
I don't think of who I'm missing 
I've got no space and no time 
In my life, anymore 
No space or time 
In my life, anymore 
For Revenge

 

WIDE TO RECEIVE

Download something 
Useful, or useless 
Because I'm lying here 
Wide to receive 
Almost anything 
You'd care to give 
And I don't 
Get along with myself 
And I'm not too keen 
On anyone else 
Turn on, plug in 
Then just walk away 
Unlock, process 
And then just go 
And I've never felt quite so alone 
As I do right now 
I'm lying here 
Wide to receive 
Almost anything 
You'd care to leave 
Wide, wide, wide Wide, wide, wide...

 

ROY'S KEEN

(GO ON !)
He's romancing you 
And chancing his arm 
He'll be here 
Smiling on time 
He's romancing you 
And chancing his arm 
He'll be here 
Smiling on time 
Roy's keen oh Roy's keen 
Roy's keen oh Roy's keen 
We've never seen a 
Keener window-cleaner 
Back up the ladder 
Into each corner 
Dunking the chamois 
Just think of the goodwill 
The ladder's a planet 
Roy is a star, and 
I am a satellite 
(But that's alright) 
He can hold a smile for as long 
As you require (even longer) 
He can hold a smile for as long 
As you require (even longer) 
Roy's keen oh Roy's keen 
Roy's keen oh Roy's keen 
We've never seen a 
Keener window-cleaner 
Back up the ladder 
Into each corner 
Dunking the chamois 
Just think of the goodwill 
The ladder's a planet 
Roy is a star, and 
I am a satellite 
I will be set alight 
Don't say you'll hold it steady 
Then you let it go 
Don't say you'll hold it steady 
Then you let it go Oh ...
You're up the ladder 
Into each corner 
Foot in a bucket 
We trust you to wreck it 
Even when it's under your nose 
Well, you just can't 
See it, can you ? 
Well, it's here 
Right under your nose 
And you just can't 
See it, can you? La la la la ...
Roy's keen, Roy's keen La la la la ...
We've never seen a 
Keener window-cleaner 
Oh ... La la la la ...

 

HE CRIED

I need you 
Simple words 
But words which had never been heard 
By the soul 
Stoned to death 
But still living 
And so he froze where he stood 
And he looked to the ground 
And he cried 
He cried 
Ride our minds 
If you must 
But there's always a line you don't cross 
Time is short 
Don't be cruel 
Oh you don't know the power 
In what you're saying 
Oh ... 
And so he froze where he stood 
And he looked to the ground 
And he cried 
He cried 
People where 
I come from 
They survive without feelings or blood 
I never could 
Was stoned to death 
But I'm still living 
So he froze where he stood 
And he looked to the ground 
And he cried 
He cried 
So he froze 
And he looked, and he looked 
To the ground 
And he cried 
He cried

 

SORROW WILL COME IN THE END

Legalized theft 
Leaves me bereft 
I get it straight in the neck 
(Somehow expecting no less) 
A court of justice 
With no use for Truth 
Lawyer ...liar 
Lawyer ...liar 
You pleaded and squealed 
And you think you've won 
But Sorrow will come 
To you in the end 
And as sure as my words are pure 
I praise the day that brings you pain 
Q.C.'s obsessed with sleaze 
Frantic for Fame 
They're all on the game 
They just use a different name 
You lied 
And you were believed 
By a J.P. senile and vile 
You pleaded and squealed 
And you think you've won 
But Sorrow will come 
To you in the end 
And as sure as my words are pure 
I praise the day that brings you pain 
So don't close your eyes 
Don't close your eyes 
A man who slits throats 
Has time on his hands 
And I'm gonna get you 
So don't close your eyes 
Don't ever close your eyes 
You think you've won 
OH NO

 

SATAN REJECTED MY SOUL

Satan rejected my soul 
He knows my kind 
He won't be dragged down 
He's seen my face around 
He knows Heaven doesn't seem 
To be my home 
So I must find 
Somewhere else to go 
So I must find 
Somewhere else to go 
So, take it - please 
It's free 
You'll never see 
You'll never see 
All the fun in life it's cost me 
Satan rejected my soul 
As low as he goes 
He never quite goes this low 
He's seen my face around 
He knows Heaven doesn't seem 
To be my home 
So I must find 
Somewhere else to go 
So I must find 
Somewhere else to go 
So, take it please 
It's really sly 
Come on, come on, ah Come on, come on, come on 
Take it please, It's really sly 
Come on, come on, ah Come on, come on, come on 
Call me in, Pull me in, call me in 
Come on, come on, oh Come on, come on, come on 
Pull me in, pull me in, Call me in, haul me in, pull me in 
Come on, come on, ah, Come on, come on 
La la la la la, Oh ...

 
 REEL AROUND THE FOUNTAIN

It's time the tale was told
of how you took a child
and you made him old
Reel around the fountain
slap me on the patio
I'll take it now
Fifteen minutes with you
well, I wouldn't say no
people said that you were virtually dead
and they were so wrong
fifteen minutes with you
well, i wouldn't say no
people said that you were easily led
and they were half-right
I dreamt about you last night
and i fell out of bed twice
you can pin and mount me like a butterfly
but take me to the haven of your bed
was something that you never said
two lumps, please
you're the bee's knees
but so am I
Meet me at the fountain
shove me on the patio
I'll take it slowly
Fifteen minutes with you
oh I wouldn't say no
people see no worth in you
oh but I do

 

YOU'VE GOT EVERYTHING NOW

As merry as the days were long
I was right and you were wrong
back at the old grey school
I would win and you would lose
But you've got everything now
and what a terrible mess I've made of my life
No, I've never had a job
because I've never wanted one
I've seen you smile
but I've never really heard you laugh
So who is rich and who is poor?
I cannot say...
You are your mother's only son
and you're a desperate one
But I don't want a lover
I just want to be seen in the back of your car
A friendship sadly lost?
Well, this is true ...and yet, it's false
Did I ever tell you , by the way
I never did like your face
But you've got everything now
and what a terrible mess I've made of my life
No, I've never had a job
because I'm too shy
But I don't want a lover
I just want to be tied to the back of your car.

 

MISERABLE LIE

So, goodbye
please stay with your own kind
and I'll stay with mine
There's something against us
it's not time
So, goodbye
I know I hardly say
how much I love your casual way
but please put your tongue away
a little higher and we're well away
the dark nights are drawing in
and your humour is as black as them
I look at yours, you laugh at mine
and"love" is just a miserable lie
you have destroyed my flower like-life
not once-but twice
you have corrupt my innocent mind
not once-but twice
I know that wind-swept mystical air
it means: I'd like to see your underwear
I recognise that mystical air
it means: I'd like to see your underwear
what do we get for the trouble and pain?
just a rented room in Whalley Range
into the depths of the criminal world
I followed her...
I need advice, I need advice
because nobody ever looks at me twice
I'm just a country-mile behind
the world
I'm just a country mile behind
the whole world
so take me when you go

 

PRETTY GIRLS MAKE GRAVES

Upon the sand,upon the bay
"there is a quick and easy way" you say
before you illustrate
I'd rather state:
"I'm not the man you think I am
I'm not the man you think I am "
And Sorrow's native son
he will not smile for anyone
And pretty girls makes the graves
End of the pier, end of the bay
you tug my arm and say:"Give into lust,
give up to lust, oh heaven knows we'll
soon be dust..."
But I'm not the man you think I am
I'm not the man you think I am
And Sorrow's native son
he will not rise for anyone
And pretty girls make graves
I could have been wild and I could have been free
but Nature played this trick on me
She wants it Now
and she will not wait
but she's too rough
and I'm too delicate
Then on the sand
another man, he takes her hand
and a smile lights up her stupid face
(and well, it would)
I lost my faith in Womanhood
I lost my faith in Womanhood, I lost my faith

 

THE HAND THAT ROCKS THE CRADLE

Please don't cry
the ghost and the storm outside
will not invade this sacred shire
nor infiltrate your mind
my life down I shall lie
if the bogey-man should try
to play tricks on your sacred mind
to tease, torment and tantalise
wavering shadows loom
a piano plays in an empty room
there'll be blood on the cleaver tonight
when darkness lifts and the room is bright
I'll still be by your side
for you are all that matters
and I'll love you till the day I die
there never need to be longing in your eyes
as long as the hand that rocks the cradle is mine
ceiling shadows shimmy by
and when the wardrobe towers like a beast of prey
there's a sadness in your beautiful eyes
you're untouched, unsoiled, wonderous eyes
my life down I shall lie
should restless spirts try
to play tricks on you sacred mind
but whom I never gave a name
I just looked into his wonderous eyes
and said" never never never again"
all too soon I did return
just like a moth to a flame
so rattle my bones all over the stones
because I'm only a beggar-man whom nobody owns
see how words as old as sin
fit me like a glove I'm here and here I'll stay
together we lie, together we pray
there never need be longing in your eyes
as long as the hand that rocks the cradle is mine

 

STILL ILL

I decree today that life
is simply taking and not giving
England is mine and it owes me a living
ask me why, and I'll spit in your eye
ask me why, and I'll spit in your eye
but we cannot cling to the old dreams anymore
no, we cannot cling to the old dreams anymore
Does the body rule the mind
or does the mind rule the body?
I dunno...
Under the iron bridge we kissed
and although I ended up with sore lips
it just wasn't like the old days anymore
no, it wasn't like those days
am I still ill?
Does the body rule the mind
or does the mind rule the body ?
I dunno...
Ask me why, and I'll die
ask me why, and I'll die
and if you must go to work tomorrow
well, if I were you I wouldn't bother
for there are brighter sides to life
and I should know because I've seen them
but not very often...
under the iron bridge we kissed
and although I ended up with sore lips
it just wasn't like the old days anymore
no, it wasn't like those days
am I still ill?

 

HAND IN GLOVE

Hand in glove
the sun shines out of our behinds
no, it's not like any other love
this one is different-because it's us
Hand in glove
we can go wherever we please
and everything depends upon
how near you stand to me
And if the people stare
then the people stare
I really don't know and I really don't care
Hand in glove
the Good People laugh
yes, we may be hidden by rags
but we have something they'll never have
So, hand in glove I stake my claim
I'll fight to the last breath
If they dare touch a hair on your head
I'll fight to the last breath
The Good Life is out there, somewhere
so stay on my arm, you little charmer
But I know my luck too well
and I'll probably never see you again.

 

WHAT DIFFERENCE DOES IT MAKE?

All men have secrets and here is mine
so let it be known
we have been through hell and high tide,
I can surely rely on you?
and yet you start to recoil,
heavy words are so lightly thrown
but still I'd leap in front of a flying bullet for you
So, what difference does it make?
so, what difference does it make?
it makes none
but you have gone
and you must be looking very old tonight
The devil will find work for idle hands to do
I stole and I lied, and why?
because you asked me to!
but now you make feel so ashamed
because I've only got two hands
well, I'm still fond of you
So, what difference does it make?
so, what difference does it make?
it makes none
but you have gone
and your prejudice won't keep you warm tonight
So, no more apologies
no more apologies
I'm too tired
I'm too sick and tired
and I'm feeling very sick and ill today
But I'm still fond of you

 

I DON'T OWE YOU ANYTHING

Bought on stolen wine
a nod was the first step
you know very well
what was coming next
did I really walk all this way
just to hear you say
"oh I don't want to go out tonight"
but you will
for you must
I don't owe you anything
but you owe me something
repay me now
you should never go to them
let them come to you
just like I do
you should not go to them
let them come to you
just like I do
Too freely on your lips
words prematurely said
oh but I know what will make you smile tonight
Life is never kind
life is never kind
oh but I know what will make you smile tonight

 

SUFFER LITTLE CHILDREN

Over the moors,take me to the moors
dig a shallow grave
and I'll lay me down
Lesley-Anne, with your pretty white beads
oh John, you'll never be a man
and you'll never see your home again
oh Manchester, so much to answer for
Edward, see those alluring lights?
tonight will be your very last night
a woman said "I know my son is dead
I'll never rest my hands on his scared head"
Hindley wakes and Hindley says:
"Wherever he has gone, I have gone "
But fresh lilaced moorland fields
cannot hide the stoild stench of death
Hindley wakes and Hindley says:
"Whatever he has done, I have done"
But this is no easy ride
for a child cries
"find me...find me, nothing more
we're on a sullen misty moor
we may be dead and we may be gone
but we will be right by your side
until the day you die
this is no easy ride
we will haunt you when you laugh
yes, you could say we're a team
you might sleep
BUT YOU WILL NEVER DREAM!"
Oh Manchester, so much to answer for
Oh Manchester, so much to answer for
Over the moor, I'm on the moor
the child is on the moor

 

THE HEADMASTER RITUAL

Belligerent ghouls
run Manchester schools
spineless swines
cemented mines
Sir leads the troops
jealous of youth
same old suit since 1962
he does the military two-step
down the nape of my neck
I wanna go home
I don't want to stay
give up education
is a bad mistake
mid-week on the playing fields
Sir thwacks you on the knees
knees you in the groin
elbow in the face
I wanna go home
I don't want to stay
Belligerent ghouls
run Manchester schools
spineless bastards all
Sir leads the troops
jealous of youth
same old jokes since 1902
he does the military two-step
down the nape of my neck
I wanna go home
I don't want to stay
give up life
as a bad mistake
please excuse me from gym
I've got this terrible cold coming on
he grabs and devours
he kicks me in the showers
kicks me in the showers
and he grabs and devours
I wanna go home
I don't want to stay

 

RUSHOLME RUFFIANS

The last night at the fair
by the big wheel generator
a boy is stabbed
and his money is grabbed
and the air hangs heavy like a dulling wine
she is famous
she is funny
an engagement ring
doesn't mean a thing
to a mind consumed by brass(money)
and though I walk home alone
my faith in love is still devout
the last night at the fair
from a seat on a whirling waltzer
her skirt ascends for a watching eye
it's a hideous trait( on her mother's side)
and though I walk home alone
my faith in love is still devout
then someone falls in love
and someone's beaten up
and the senses being dulled are mine

this is the last night of the fair

of a speedway operator
is all a tremulous heart requires
a schoolgirl is denied
she said "How quickly would I die
if I jumped from the top of the parachutes?"

I WANT THE ONE I CAN'T HAVE

On the day that your mentality
catches up with your biology
I want the one I can't have
and it's driving me mad
it's written all over my face
A double-bed
and a stalwart lover, for sure
these are the riches of the poor
A double-bed
and a stalwart lover, for sure
these are the riches of the poor
a tough kid who sometimes swallows nails
raised on Prisoner's Aid
he killed a policeman when he was thirteen
and somehow that really impressed me
it's written all over my face
On the day that your mentality
catches up with your biology
And if you ever need self-validation
just meet me in the alley by the
railway-station
it's written all over my face

 

WHAT SHE SAID

What she said:
"How come someone hasn't noticed
that I'm dead
and decided to bury me
God knows, I'm ready"
What she said was
but then, all the rejection she's had
to pretend to be happy
could only be idiocy
What she said was not for the job or
lover that she never had
What she read
all heady books
she'd sit and prophesise
(it took a tattoed boy from Birkenhead
to really really open her eyes)

THAT JOKE ISN'T FUNNY ANYMORE

Park the car at the side of the road
you should know
time's tide will smother you
and I will too
when you laugh about other people who feel so
very lonely
their only desire is to die
well I'm afraid
it doesn't make me smile
I wish I could laugh
but that joke isn't funny anymore
it's too close to home and it's too near the bone
it's too close to home and it's too near the bone
more than you'll ever know
It was dark as I drove the point home
and on cold leather seats
well, it suddenly struck me
I just might die with a smile on my
face after all
I've seen this happen in other people's lives
and now it's happening in mine

 

NOWHERE FAST

I'd like to drop my trousers to the world
I am a man of means(of slender means)
each household appliance
is like a new science in my town
and if a day came when I felt a natural emotion
I'd get such a shock I'd probably jump in the ocean
and when a train goes by
it's such a sad sound
I'd like to drop my trousers to the Queen
every sensible child will know what this means
the poor and the needy
are selfish and greedy on her terms
and if the day came when I felt a natural emotion
I'd get such a shock I'd probably jump in the ocean
and when a train goes by
it's such a sad song
And when I'm lying in my bed
I think about life
and I think about death
and neither one particularly appeals to me
and if the day came when I felt a natural emotion
I'd get such a shock I'd probably lie
in the middle of the street and die
I'd lie down and die

 

WELL I WONDER

Well I wonder
do you hear me when you sleep?
I hoarsely cry
Well I wonder
do you see me when we pass?
I half-die
Please keep me in mind
please keep me in mind
Gasping-but somehow still alive
this is the fierce last stand of all I am
Gasping-dying-but somehow still alive
this is the final stand of all I am
Please keep me in mind

 

BARBARISM BEGINS AT HOME

Unruly boys
who will not grow up
must be taken in hand
Unruly girls
who will not settle down
they must be taken in hand
A crack on the head
is what you get for not asking
and a crack on the head
is what you get for asking

 

MEAT IS MURDER

Heifer whines could be human cries
closer comes the screaming knife
this beautiful creature must die
this beautiful creature must die
a death for no reason
and death for reason is MURDER
and the flesh you so fancifully fry
is not succulent, tasty or nice
it's death for no reason
and death for no reason is MURDER
and the calf that you carve with a smile
is MURDER
and the turkey you festively slice
is MURDER
do you know how animals die?
kitchen aroma aren't very homely
it's not "comforting," "cheery" or kind
it's sizzling blood and the unholy stench
of MURDER
it's not "natural," "normal" or kind
the fleas you so fancifully fry
as you savour the flavour
of MURDER
NO, NO, NO, IT'S MURDER
NO, NO, NO, IT'S MURDER
who hears when animals cry?

 

THE QUEEN IS DEAD

Farewell to this lands cheerless marches
hemmed in like a boar between arches
her very Lowness with her head in a sling
Im truely sorry-but it sounds like a wonderful thing
dear Charles, dont you ever crave
to appear on the front of the Daily mail
dressed in your Mother's bridal veil?
So, I checked all the registered historical facts
and I was shocked into shame to discover
how Im the 18th pale descendent
of some, old queen or other
has the world changed, or have I changed?
has the world changed, or have I changed?
as some 9-year old tough peddles drugs
(I never even knew what drugs were)
And so, I broke into the Palace
with a sponge and a rusty spanner
she said: "Eh, I know you, and you cannot sing"
I said: "that's nothing -you should hear me play piano"
We can go for a walk where it's quiet and dry
and we can talk about precious things
but when you are tied to your mother's apron
not one talks about castration
We can go for a walk where it's quiet and dry
and we can talk about precious things
like love and law and poverty
these are the things that kill me
We can go for a walk where it's quiet and dry
and we can talk about precious things
but the rain that flattens my hair
theses are the things that kill me
Passed the Pub that saps your body
and the church who'll snatch your money
the Queen is dead, boys
and it's so lonely on a limb
Pass the Pub that wrecks your body
and the church-all they want is your money
the Queen is dead, boys`
you can trust me, boys
life is very long, when you're lonely
life is very long, when you're lonely...

 

FRANKLY MR.SHANKLY

Frankly, Mr Shankly, this position Ive held
it pays my way, but it corrodes my soul
I want to leave you will not miss me
I want to go down in musical history
Frankly, Mr Shankly, Im a sickening wreck
Ive got the 21st Century breathing down my neck
I must move fast, you understand me
I want to go down in celluloid history
Fame, Fame, fatal Fame
it can play hideous tricks on the brain
but still I rather be Famous
than righteous or holy, any day
but sometimes Id feel more fulfilled
making Christmas cards with the mentally ill
I want to Live and I want to Love
I want to catch something that I might be ashamed of
Frankly, Mr Shankly, this position I've held
it pays my way and it corrodes my soul
oh, I didnt realise that you wrote poetry
(I didnt realise you wrote such bloody awful poetry)
Frankly, Mr Shankly, since you ask
you are a flatulent pain the arse
I do not mean to be so rude
but still, I must speck frankly, Mr Shankly

 

I KNOW IT'S ALL OVER

Oh Mother, I can fell the soil falling over my head
and as i climb into an empty bed
Oh well, Enough said
I know it's over-still I cling
I don't know where else I can go
Oh Mother, I can feel the soil falling over my head
see, the sea want s to take me
the knife wants to cut me
do you think you can help me?
Sad veiled bride, please be happy
handsome groom, give her room
loud, loutish lover, treat her kindly
(although she needs you
more than she loves you)
and I know it's over
and it never really began
but in my heart it was so real
and you even spoke to me and said:
"If you're so funny
then why are you on your own tonight?
and if you are so clever
then why are you on your own tonight?
if you're so terribly good looking
then why do you sleep alone tonight?
because tonight is just like any other night
that's why you're on your own tonight
with your triumphs and your charms
while they are in each other's arms.."
It's so easy to laugh
it's so easy to hate
it takes strength to be gentle and kind
It's so easy to laugh
it's so easy to hate
it takes guts to be gentle and kind
love is Natural and Real
but not for you, my love
not tonight my love
love is Natural and Real
but not for such as you and I, my love
Oh Mother, I can fell the soil falling over my head
Oh Mother, I can fell the soil falling over my head...

 

NEVER HAD NO ONE EVER

When you walk without ease
on these
the very streets where you were raised
I had a really bad dream
it lasted 20 years, 7 months, and 27 days
Never had no one ever.

 

CEMETERY GATES

A dreaded sunny day
so I meet you at the cemetry gates
Keats and Yeats are on your side
A dreaded sunny day
so I meet you at the cemetry gates
Keats and Yeats are on your side
while Wilde is on mine
So we go inside and we gravely read the stones
all those people all those lives
where are they now ?
with loves, and hates
and passions just like mine
they were born
and then they lived and then they died
which seems so unfair
and I wantr to crv
You say: "ere thrice the sun hath done salutation to the dawn"
and you claim these words as your own
but Im well-read, have heard them said
a hundred times (maybe less, maybe more)
if you must write prose/poems
the words you use should be your own
dont plagiarise or take "on loans"
there's alweays someone, somewhere
with a big nose, who knows
and who trips you up and laughs
when you fall
You say: "ere long done do does did "
words which could only be your own
you then produce the text
from whence was ripped
(some dizzy whore, 1804)
A dreaded sunny day
so let's go where we're happy
so I meet you at the cemetry gates
Keats and Yeats are on your side
A dreaded sunny day
so let's go where we're wanted
so I meet you at the cemetry gates
Keats and Yeats are on your side
but you lose
because Wilde is on mine

 

BIGMOUTH STRIKES AGAIN

Sweetness, sweetness I was only joking
when I said Id like to smash every tooth
in your head
Sweetness, sweetness I was only joking
when I said by right s you should be
bludgeoned in your bed
and now I know how Joan of Arc felt
now I know how Joan of Arc felt
as the flames roseto her roman nose
and her Walkman stared to melt
Bibmouth, bigmouth
bigmouth strikes again
and Ive got no right to take my place
with the Human race
and now I know how Joan of Arc felt
now I know of Joan of Arc felt
as the flames rose to her roman nose
and her hearing aid started to melt
Bigmouth, bigmouth
bigmouth strikes again
and Ive got no right to take my place

THE BOY WITH A THORN IN HIS SIDE

The boy with the thorn in his side
behind the hatred there lies
a murderous desire for love
how can they look into my eyes
and still they dont believe me
how can they hear me say those words
and still they dont believe me
and if they don't believe me now
will they ever believe me?
and if they don't believe me now
will they ever believe me?
The boy with the thorn in his side
behind the hatred there lies
a plundering desire for love
how can they see the Love in our eyes
and still they don't believe us
and after all this time
they don't want to believe us
and if they dont believe us now
will they ever believe us ?
andd when you want to Live
how do you start ?
where do you go ?
who do you know?

 

VICAR IN A TUTU

I was minding mind business
lifting some lead off
the roof of the Holy Name church
it was worthwhile living a laughable life
just to set my eyes on a blistering sight
of a vicar in a tu-tu
he's not strange
he just wants to live his life this way
a scanty bit of a thing
with a decorative ring
that wouldn't cover the head of a child
as Rose collects the money in the cannister
who comes sliding down the bannister
the vicar in a tu-tu
he's not strange
he just wants to live his life this way
the monkish monsignor
with a head full of plaster
said "my man, get your vile soul dry-cleaned"
as Rose counts the money in the cannister
as natural as rain
he dances again
vicar in a tu-tu
The next day in the pulpit
with Freedom and Ease
combating ignoranca,dust and disease
as Rose counts the money in the cannister
as natural as rain
he dances again
the fabric of a tu-tu
any man could get us to
and I am a living sign.

 

THERE IS A LIGHT THAT NEVER GOES OUT

Take me out tonight
where there's music and there's people
who are young and alive
driving in your car
I never never want to go home
because I havent got one
anymore
take me out tonight
because I want to see people and I
want to see lights
driving in your car
oh please dont drop me home
because it's not my home, it's their
home, and Im welcome no morw
and if a double-decker bus
crashes in to us
to die by your side
such a heavenly way to die
and if a ten ton truck
kills the both of us
to die by your side
the pleasure and the privilege is mine
take me out tonight
oh take me anywhere, I dont care
and in the darken underpass
I thought Oh God, my chance has come at last
(but then a strange fear gripped me and I just couldn't ask)
take me out tonight
take me anywhere, I dont care
just driving in your car
I never never want to go home
because I havent got one
I havent got one.

 

SOME GIRLS ARE BIGGER THAN OTHERS

From the ice-age to the dole-age
there is but one concern
and I have just discover
some girls are bigger than others
some girls are bigger than others
some girls mothers are bigger than
other girls mothers
As Anthony said to Cleopatra
as he opened a crate of ale:

A RUSH AND A PUSH AND AND THE LAND IS OURS

HELLO
I am the ghost of Troubled Joe
hung by his pretty white neck
some eighteen months ago
I travelled to a mystical time zone
but I missed my bed
so I soon came home
they said:
"there's too much caffeine
in your bloodstream
and a lack of real spice
in your life"
I said:
"leave me alone
because I'm alright, dad
just surprised to still
be on my own...."
Ooh, but don't mention love
I'd hate the real strain of the pain again
a rush and a push and the land that
we stand on is ours
it has been before
so it shall be again
and people who are uglier than you and I
they take what they need, and leave
Ooh, but don't mention love
I'd hate the pain and the strain all over again
a rush and a push and the land that
we stand on is ours
it has been before
so why can't it be now?
and people who are weaker than you and I
they take what they want from life
Ooh, but don't mention love
no - just don't mention love!
a rush and a push and the land that
we stand on is ours
your youth may be gone
but you're still a young man
so phone me, phone me, phone me
so phone me, phone me, phone me
Ooh, I think I'm in love...
Urrgh, I think I'm in lerv

 

I STARTED SOMETHING I COULDN'T FINISH

The lanes were silent
with nothing or no one around for miles
I doused our friendly venture
with a hard-faced
three-word gesture
I started something
I forced you into a zone
and you were clearly
never meant to go
hair brushed and parted
typical me, typical me, typical me
I started something
...and now I'm not too sure
I grabbed you by the guilded beams
that's what Tradition means
and I doused another venture
with a gesture
that was...absolutely vile
I started something
forced you to a zone
and you were clearly
never meant to go
hair brushed and parted
typical me, typical me, typical me
I started something
...and now I'm not too sure
I grabbed you by the guilded beams
that's what Tradition means
and now eighteen months' hard-labour
seems...fair enough
I started something
forced you to a zone
and you were clearly
never meant to go
hair brushed and parted
typical me, typical me, typical me
I started something
and now I'm not too sure

 

DEATH OF A DISCO DANCER

The death of a disco dancer
well, it happens a lot 'round here
and if you think Peace
is a common goal
well, that goes to show
just how little you know
The death of a disco dancer
well, I'd rather not get involved
I never talk to my neighbour
I'd just rather not get involved
Love, peace and harmony?
Love, peace and harmony?
Oh, very nice, very nice, very nice, very nice
...but maybe in the next world.

 

GIRLFRIEND IN A COMA

Girlfriend in a coma, I know
I know - it's serious
Girlfriend in a coma, I know
I know - it's really serious
there wree times when I could
have 'murdered' her
(but, you know, I would hate
anything to happen to her)
NO, I DON'T WANT TO SEE HER
Do you really think
she'll pull through?
Do you really think
she'll pull through?
Girlfriend in a coma, I know
I know, it's serious
there were time when I could
have 'strangeled' her
(but, you know, I would hate
anything to happen to her)
WOULD YOU PLEASE LET ME SEE HER!
Do you really think she'll pull through?
Do you really think she'll pull through?
Let me wisper my last goodbyes
I know - IT'S SERIOUS

 

STOP ME IF YOU'VE HEARD THIS ONE BEFORE

Stop me, stop me,
stop me if you think that you've heard this one before
stop me, stop me
stop me if you think that you've heard this one before
nothing's changed
I still love you, oh I still love you
...only slightly less than I used to
I was delayed, I was way-laid
an emergency stop
I smelt the last ten seconds of life
I crashed down on the crossbar
and the pain was enough to make
a shy, bald buddhist reflect
and plan a mass-murder
who said I'd lied to her?
who said I'd lied because I never
who said I'd lied because I never
I was detained, I was restrained
he broke my spleen
he broke my knees
(and then he really laid into me)
Friday night in Out-patients
who said I'd lied to her?
who said I'd lied - because I never
who said I'd lied - because I never
Oh, so I drank one
or was it four
and when I fell on the floor
...I drank more
stop me, stop me
stop me if you think that you've heard this one before
nothing's changed
I still love you, I still love you
but only slightly
less than I used to

 

LAST NIGHT I DREAMT THAT SOMEBODY LOVED ME

Last night I dreamt
that somebody loved me
no hope - but no harm
just another false alarm
Las night I felt
real arms around me
no hope - no harm
just another false alarm
so, tell me how long
before the last one?
and tell me how long
before the right one?
this story is old - I KNOW
but it goes on
this story is old - I KNOW
but it goes on

 

UNHAPPY BIRTHDAY

I've come to wish you an unhappy birthday
I've come to wish you an unhappy birthday
because you're evil
and you lie
and if you should die
I may feel slightly sad
(but I won't cry)
Loved and lost
and some may say
when usually its Nothing
surely you're happy
it should be this way?
I say "No, I'm gonna kill my dog"
and: "May the lines sag heavy
and deep tonight XXX"

PAINT A VULGAR PICTURE

At the record company meeting
On their hands - a dead star
and ooh, the plans that they weave
and ooh, the sikening greed
At the record company meeting
on their hands - a dead star
the sycophantic slags all say:
"I knew him first, and I knew him well"
Re-issue! Re-package! Re-package!
Re-evaluate the songs
double-pack with a photograph
Extra Track (and a tacky badge)
A-list, playlist
"Please them, please them!"
"Please them! Please them!"
(sadly, THIS was your life)
but you could have said no
if you'd wanted to
you could have said no
if you'd wanted to
BPI, MTV, BBC
"Please them! Please them!"
(sadly this was your life)
but you could have said no
if you'd wanted to
you could have walked away
...couldn't you?
I touched you at the soundcheck
you had no real way of knowing
in my heart I bgged "please, take
me with you...
I don't care where you're going"
But to you I was faceless
I was fawning, I was boring
just a child from those ugly new houses
who could never begin to know
who could never really know
Best of? Most of?
Satiate the need
slip them into different sleeves!
Buy both, and be decieved
climber - new entry, re-entry
World tour! ("media whore")
"Please the Press in Belgium!"
(THIS was your life...)
and when it fails to recoup?
Well, maybe:
You just haven't earned it yet, baby
I walked a pace behind you at the soundcheck
you're just the same as I am
what makes most people feel happy
leads us headlong into harm
so, in my bedroom in those 'ugly new houses'
I dance my legs down to the knees
but me and my 'true love'
we will never meet again...
At the record company meeting
on their hands - at last! - a dead star!
but they cannot taint you in my eyes
no, they cannout touch you now
No, they cannot hurt you my darling
they cannot touch you now
but me and my 'true love'
will never meet again

 

DEATH AT ONE'S ELBOW

Ooh Glenn, don't come to the house tonight
Ooh, Glenn, don't come to the house tonight
because there's somebody here
who really really loves you
stay home
be bored
(it's crap, I KNOW)
Ooh, Glenn, don't come to the house tonight
Ooh, Glen, don't come to the house tonight
because there's somebody here
who'll take a hatchet to your ear
how the frustration renders me
hateful, Glenn!
don't come to the house tonight
don't come to the house tonight
because you'll slip on the
trail of my bespattered remains
and so, that's why
GOODBYE MY LOVE, GOODBYE MY LOVE, GOODBYE MY LOVE...
Belch

 

I WON'T SHARE YOU

I won't share you
I won't share you
with the drive and ambition
and the zeal I feel
this is my time
as the note I wrote
was read, she said
has the Perrier gone
straight to my head
or is life plainly sick and cruel, instead?
"YES!"
No-no-no-no-no-no
I won't share you
I won't share you
with the drive and the dreams inside
this is my time
Life tends to come and go
well, that's OK
just as long as you know
Life tends to come and go
well, that's OK
just as long as you know
I won't share you
I won't share you

this is my time, this is my time


THE QUEEN IS DEAD

Farewell to this lands cheerless marches
hemmed in like a boar between arches
her very Lowness with her head in a sling
Im truely sorry-but it sounds like a wonderful thing
dear Charles, dont you ever crave
to appear on the front of the Daily mail
dressed in your Mother's bridal veil?
So, I checked all the registered historical facts
and I was shocked into shame to discover
how Im the 18th pale descendent
of some, old queen or other
has the world changed, or have I changed?
has the world changed, or have I changed?
as some 9-year old tough peddles drugs
(I never even knew what drugs were)
And so, I broke into the Palace
with a sponge and a rusty spanner
she said: "Eh, I know you, and you cannot sing"
I said: "that's nothing -you should hear me play piano"
We can go for a walk where it's quiet and dry
and we can talk about precious things
but when you are tied to your mother's apron
not one talks about castration
We can go for a walk where it's quiet and dry
and we can talk about precious things
like love and law and poverty
these are the things that kill me
We can go for a walk where it's quiet and dry
and we can talk about precious things
but the rain that flattens my hair
theses are the things that kill me
Passed the Pub that saps your body
and the church who'll snatch your money
the Queen is dead, boys
and it's so lonely on a limb
Pass the Pub that wrecks your body
and the church-all they want is your money
the Queen is dead, boys`
you can trust me, boys
life is very long, when you're lonely
life is very long, when you're lonely...

 

PANIC

Panic on the streets of London
Panic on the streets of Birmingham
I wonder to myself
Could life ever be sane again
on the Leeds side-streets that you slip down
I wonder to myself
Hopes may rise on the Grasmeres
But Honey Pie, you're not safe here
So you run down
To the safety of the town
But there's Panic on the streets of Carlisle
Dublin, Dundee, Humberside
I wonder to myself
Burn down the Disco
Hang the blessed D.J.
Because the music that they constantly play
IT SAYS NOTHING TO ME ABOUT MY LIFE
Hang the blessed D.J.
Because the music they constantly play
On the Leeds side-streets that you slip down
On the provincial towns that you jog 'round
Hang the D.J.,. Hang the D.J.,.Hang the D.J...

 

VICAR IN A TUTU

I was minding mind business
lifting some lead off
the roof of the Holy Name church
it was worthwhile living a laughable life
just to set my eyes on a blistering sight
of a vicar in a tu-tu
he's not strange
he just wants to live his life this way
a scanty bit of a thing
with a decorative ring
that wouldn't cover the head of a child
as Rose collects the money in the cannister
who comes sliding down the bannister
the vicar in a tu-tu
he's not strange
he just wants to live his life this way
the monkish monsignor
with a head full of plaster
said "my man, get your vile soul dry-cleaned"
as Rose counts the money in the cannister
as natural as rain
he dances again
vicar in a tu-tu
The next day in the pulpit
with Freedom and Ease
combating ignoranca,dust and disease
as Rose counts the money in the cannister
as natural as rain
he dances again
the fabric of a tu-tu
any man could get us to
and I am a living sign.

 

ASK

Shyness is nice, but
Shyness can stop you
From doing all the things in life
That you'd like to
So, if there's something you'd like to try
ASK ME-I WON'T SAY "NO"-HOW COULD I?
Coyness is nice, but ,
Coyness can stop you
from saying all the things in
life that you want to
If there's something that you'd like to try
ASK ME-I WON'TSAY"NO"-HOW COULD I?
Spending warm, Summer days indoors
Writing fringhtening verse
To a buck-toothed girl in Luxembourg
ASK ME, ASK ME ,ASK ME, ASK ME, ASK ME ,ASK ME
Because if it's not Love
Then it's the Bomb
That will bring us together
Nature is a language-can't you read?
Nature is a language-can't you read?
ASK ME, ASK ME ,ASK ME, ASK ME, ASK ME ,ASK ME
Because if it's not Love
Then it's the Bomb
That will bring us together

 

MARIE'S THE NAME (HIS LATEST FLAME) / RUSHOLME RUFFIANS

Very old friend 
Came by today 
As he was telling everyone in town 
Of all the love that he'd just found 
And Marie's the name (of his latest flame) 
Talked and talked 
And I heard him say 
That she had the longest blackest hair 
Prettiest green eyes anywhere 
And Marie's the name (of his latest flame) 
The last night of the fair 
By the big wheel generator 
A boy is stabbed 
His money is grabbed 
And the air hangs heavy like a dulling wine 
She is Famous 
She is Funny 
An engagement ring 
Doesn't mean a thing 
To a mind consumed by brass (money), oh 
The last night of the fair 
From a seat on a whirling waltzer 
Her skirt ascends for a watching eye 
It's a hideous trait (on her mother's side)
From a seat on a whirling waltzer 
Her skirt ascends for a watching eye 
A hideous trait (on her mother's side) 
Then someone falls in love 
Someone's beaten up 
Someone's beaten up 
And the senses being dulled are mine 
And someone falls in love 
Someone's beaten up 
And the senses being dulled are mine 
This is the last night of the fair 
And the grease in the hair 
Of a speedway operator 
Is all a tremulous heart requires 
A schoolgirl is denied 
She said : "How quickly would I die 
If I jumped from the top of the parachutes ?"
This is the last night of the fair 
And the grease in the hair 
Of a speedway operator 
Is all a tremulous heart requires 
A schoolgirl is denied 
She said : "How quickly would I die 
Oh, if I jumped from the top of the parachutes ?"
...Oh, walk home alone 
I might walk home alone 
But my faith in love is still devout

 

THE BOY WITH THE THORN IN HIS SIDE

The boy with the thorn in his side
behind the hatred there lies
a murderous desire for love
how can they look into my eyes
and still they dont believe me
how can they hear me say those words
and still they dont believe me
and if they don't believe me now
will they ever believe me?
and if they don't believe me now
will they ever believe me?
The boy with the thorn in his side
behind the hatred there lies
a plundering desire for love
how can they see the Love in our eyes
and still they don't believe us
and after all this time
they don't want to believe us
and if they dont believe us now
will they ever believe us ?
andd when you want to Live
how do you start ?
where do you go ?
who do you know?

 

RUBBER RING / WHAT SHE SAID

Yeah! What she says : 
"How come someone hasn't noticed 
That I'm dead 
And decided to bury me ? 
God knows, I'm ready !"
La-la-la ... 
What she said was sad 
But then, all the rejection she's had 
To pretend to be happy 
Could only be idiocy 
La-la-la ... 
What she said was not for the job or 
Lover that she never had 
No no no ... 
What she read 
All heady books 
She'd sit and prophesise 
(It took a tattooed boy from 
Birkenhead 
To really really open her eyes)
What she read

AND I NEED TO CLING TO SOMETHING !"
What she said :

No no no no ...

 

IS IT REALLY SO STRANGE?

I left the North 
I travelled South 
I found a tiny house 
And I can't help the way I feel 
Oh yes, you can kick me 
And you can punch me 
And you can break my face 
But you won't change the way I feel 
'Cause I love you, Oh ... 
And is it really so strange ? 
Oh, is it really so strange ? 
Oh, is it really so, really so strange ? 
I say NO, you say YES 
(and you will change your mind) 
I left the South 
I travelled North 
I got confused - I killed a horse 
I can't help the way I feel 
Oh yes, you can punch me 
And you can butt me 
And you can break my spine 
But you won't change the way I feel 
'Cause I love you, Oh ... 
And is it really so strange ? 
Oh, is it really so strange ? 
Oh, is it really so, really so strange ? 
I say NO, you say YES 
(But you will change your mind) 
I left the North again 
I travelled South again 
And I got confused - I killed a nun 
I CAN'T HELP THE WAY I FEEL 
(I lost my bag in Newport Pagnell) 
Why is the last mile the hardest mile ? 
My throat was dry, with the sun in my eyes 
And I realised, I realised 
I could never 
I could never, never, never, go back home again

 

CEMETERY GATES

A dreaded sunny day
so I meet you at the cemetry gates
Keats and Yeats are on your side
A dreaded sunny day
so I meet you at the cemetry gates
Keats and Yeats are on your side
while Wilde is on mine
So we go inside and we gravely read the stones
all those people all those lives
where are they now ?
with loves, and hates
and passions just like mine
they were born
and then they lived and then they died
which seems so unfair
and I wantr to crv
You say: "ere thrice the sun hath done salutation to the dawn"
and you claim these words as your own
but Im well-read, have heard them said
a hundred times (maybe less, maybe more)
if you must write prose/poems
the words you use should be your own
dont plagiarise or take "on loans"
there's alweays someone, somewhere
with a big nose, who knows
and who trips you up and laughs
when you fall
You say: "ere long done do does did "
words which could only be your own
you then produce the text
from whence was ripped
(some dizzy whore, 1804)
A dreaded sunny day
so let's go where we're happy
so I meet you at the cemetry gates
Keats and Yeats are on your side
A dreaded sunny day
so let's go where we're wanted
so I meet you at the cemetry gates
Keats and Yeats are on your side
but you lose
because Wilde is on mine

 

LONDON

Smoke
Lingers 'round your fingers
Train
Heave on - to Euston
Do you think you've made
The right decision this time?
You left
Your tired family grieving
And you think they're sad because you're leaving
But didn't you see the Jealousy in the eyes
Of the ones who had to stay behind?
And do you think you've made
The right decision thins time?
You left
Your girlfriend on the platform
With thei really ragged notion that you'll return
But she knows
That when he goes
He really goes
So do you think you've made
The right decision this time?

 

I KNOW IT'S OVER

I can feel the soil falling over my head 
And as I climb into an empty bed 
Oh well. Enough said. 
I know it's over - still I cling 
I don't know where else I can go 
Over ... 
Oh Mother, I can feel the soil falling over my head 
See, the sea wants to take me 
The knife wants to cut me 
Do you think you can help me ? 
Sad veiled bride, please be happy 
Handsome groom, give her room 
Loud, loutish lover, treat her kindly 
(Though she needs you 
More than she loves you) 
And I know it's over - still I cling 
I don't know where else I can go 
Over, it's over, it's over, it's over 
It's over, la ... 
I know it's over 
And it never really began 
But in my heart it was so real
And you even spoke to me, and said : 
"If you're so funny 
Then why are you on your own tonight ? 
And if you're so clever 
Then why are you on your own tonight ? 
I know ... 
'Cause tonight - it's just like any other night 
That's why you're on your own tonight 
Your triumphs and your charms 
While they're in each other's arms..."
It's so easy to laugh 
It's so easy to hate 
It takes strength to be gentle and kind 
Over, over, over, over 
It's so easy to laugh 
It's so easy to hate 
It takes guts to be gentle and kind 
Over, over 
Love is Natural and Real 
But not for you, my love 
Not tonight, my love 
Love is Natural and Real 
But not for such as you and I, my love 
Oh Mother, I can feel the soil falling over my head...
Oh Mother, I can feel the soil fall over, fall over my head 
Oh Mother, I can feel the ... fall over my ... , Oh ...

 

THE DRAIZE TRAIN

A vastly superior version of the instrumental B-side, acting as a peace 
offering to Marr (Morrissey chose the tracks for the compilation, 
and of course, receives no royalties on this track).

 

STILL ILL

I decree today that life
is simply taking and not giving
England is mine and it owes me a living
ask me why, and I'll spit in your eye
ask me why, and I'll spit in your eye
but we cannot cling to the old dreams anymore
no, we cannot cling to the old dreams anymore
Does the body rule the mind
or does the mind rule the body?
I dunno...
Under the iron bridge we kissed
and although I ended up with sore lips
it just wasn't like the old days anymore
no, it wasn't like those days
am I still ill?
Does the body rule the mind
or does the mind rule the body ?
I dunno...
Ask me why, and I'll die
ask me why, and I'll die
and if you must go to work tomorrow
well, if I were you I wouldn't bother
for there are brighter sides to life
and I should know because I've seen them
but not very often...
under the iron bridge we kissed
and although I ended up with sore lips
it just wasn't like the old days anymore
no, it wasn't like those days
am I still ill?

 

BIGMOUTH STRIKES AGAIN

Sweetness, sweetness I was only joking
when I said Id like to smash every tooth
in your head
Sweetness, sweetness I was only joking
when I said by right s you should be
bludgeoned in your bed
and now I know how Joan of Arc felt
now I know how Joan of Arc felt
as the flames roseto her roman nose
and her Walkman stared to melt
Bibmouth, bigmouth
bigmouth strikes again
and Ive got no right to take my place
with the Human race
and now I know how Joan of Arc felt
now I know of Joan of Arc felt
as the flames rose to her roman nose
and her hearing aid started to melt
Bigmouth, bigmouth
bigmouth strikes again
and Ive got no right to take my place
with the Human race

 
ALSATIAN COUSTIN

Were you and he Lovers?
and would you say so if you were?
on a forecourt
on a Friday
passing my way
Were you and he Lovers?
and if you were, then say that you were!
on a groundsheet
under canvas
with your tent-flap
open wide
A note upon his desk:
"P.S. Bring Me Home And Have Me!"
Leather elbows on a tweed coat
- Oh! -
Is THAT the best you can do?
So came his reply:
"...but on the desk is where I want you!"
So I ask (even though I know):
were you and he Lovers?

 

LITTLE MAN, WHAT NOW?

An afternoon nostalgia
television show
you spoke in silhouette
(but they couldn't name you)
although the panel were
very polite to you
but I remembered you
from Friday nights 1969
ATV - you murdered every line
too old to be a child star
too young to take leads
four seasons passed
and they AXED you
nervously juvenile
(WON'T SMILE!)
What became of you?
did that swift eclipse torture you?
a star at eighteen
and then-suddenly gone
down to a few lines
in the back page of a teenage annual
oh but I remembered you
I looked up to you

 

EVERYDAY IS LIKE SUNDAY

Trudging slowly over wet sand
back to the bench
where your clothes were stolen
this is the coastal town
that they forgot to close down
Armageddon - come Armageddon!
Come Armageddon! Come!
Everyday is like Sunday
everyday is silent and grey
Hide on the promenade
scratch out a postcard
"how I dearly with I was not here"
in the seaside town
...that they forgot to bomb
Come! Come! Come - nuclear bomb!
Everyday is like Sunday
everyday is silent and grey
Trudging back over pebbles and sand
and a strange dust lands on your hands
(and on your face)
Everyday is like Sunday
"Win Yourself A Cheap Tray"
share some greased tea with me
everyday is silent and grey

 

BENGALI IN PLATFORMS

No no no
he does not want to depress you
oh no no no no no
he only wants to impress you
Bengali in platform
she only wants to embrace your culture
and to be your friend forever
Bengali, Bengali
oh shelve your Western plans
and understand that life is hard enough when you belong here
A silver-studded rim that glistens
and an ankle-star that...blinds me
a lemon sole so very high
which only reminds me, to tell you
so I break the news gently
I break the news to you gently
"Shelve your plans"
Bengali, Bengali
its the touchy march of time
that blinds you
don't blame me
don't hate me
just because I'm the one to tell you
that life is hard enough when you belong here
life is hard enough when you belong here
shelve your western plans
life is hard enough when you belong here

 

ANGEL, ANGEL, DOWN WE GO TOGETHER

Angel, Angel
don't take your life tonight
I know they take
and that they take in turn
and they give you nothing real
for yourself in return
and when they've used you
and they've broken you
and wasted all your money
and cast your shell aside
and when they've bought you
and they've sold you
and they've billed you for the pleasure
and they've made your parents cry
I will be here
BELIEVE ME
I will be here
...believe me
Angel, don't take your life
some people have got no pride
they do not understand
the Urgency of life
but I love you more than life
I love you more than life
I love you more than life
I love you more than life

 

LALE NIGHT, MAUDLIN STREET

The last night on Maudlin Street
goodbye house
goodbye stairs
I was born here
I was raised here, and
...I took some stick here
love at first sight
may sound trite
but it's true, you know
I could list the details
of everything you ever wore
or said, or how you stood that day
and as we spend the last night
on Maudlin Street, I say
"goodbye house-forever!"
I never stole a happy hour
around here
Where the world's ugliest boy
became what you see
here I am - the ugliest man
Its the last night on Maudlin Street
and truly I do love you
oh, truly I do love you
When I sleep with that picture of
you framed beside my bed
oh, it's childish and it's silly
but I think it's you in my room
by the bed (...yes, I told you it was silly...)
and I know
I took strange pills
but I never meant to hurt you
oh truly I love you
I came home late one night
everyone had gone to bed
nobody stays up for you
when you have sixteen stitches
all around your head
the last buss I missed to Maudlin Street
so, he drove me home in the Van
complaining: "Women only like me for my mind..."
don't leave your torch behind
power-cuts ahead
as we crept through the park
but no I cannot steal a pair of jeans
off a clothesline for you
but you...without clothes
oh I could not keep a straight face
me - without clothes?
well a nation turns its back and gags...
I'm packed
I am moving house
a half-life disappears today
every slag waves me on
(secretly wishing me gone
well, I will be soon
oh - I will be soon)
There were bad times on Maudlin Street
when they took you away in a police car
dear Inspector - don't you know?
don't you care?
don't you know - about Love?
Your gran died
and your mother died
on Maudlin Street
in pain and ashamed
with never time to say
those special things
I took the keys from Maudlin Street
well, it's only bricks and mortar!
and...truly I do love you
wherever you are
wherever you are

 

SUEDHEAD

Why do you come here
why do you hang around
I'm so sorry
I'm so sorry
Why do you come here
when you know it makes
things hard for me
when you know, oh
why do you come?
Why do you telephone?
and why send me silly notes?
I'm so sorry
I'm so sorry
why do you come here
when you know it makes
thing hard for me
when you know, oh
why do you come?
You had to sneak into my room
'just' to read my diary
was it just to see all the things
you knew I'd written about you?
and...so many illustrations
I'm so very sickened
oh, I am so sickened NOW

 

BREAK UP THE FAMILY

The strange logic of your clumsiest line
stayed emblazoned on my mind
break up the family
and lets begin to live our lives
I went to see all my friends tonight
it wasn't Youth, it wasn't even Life
born Old, sadly wise
resigned (well, we were)
to ending our lives
I'm so glad to grow older
to move away from those awful times
I want to see all my friends tonight
Yes you found love but you weren't
at peace with your life
home late, full of Hate
despise the ties that bind
oh I'm so glad to grow older
to move away from those younger years
now I'm in love for the first time
and I don't feel bad
Let me see all my old friends
let me put my arm around them
because I really do love them
now, does that sound mad?
Captain of games, solid framed
I stood on the touchline
hailstones, driven home
in his car - no breaks? I don't mind
I'm just so glad to grow older
to move away from those darker years
I'm in love for the first time
and I don't feel bad
so wish me luck my friends
goodbye

 

HAIRDRESSER ON FIRE

Here is London
here is London
is it home of the free,
or what?
can you squeeze me
into an empty page of your diary
and psychologically save me
I've got faith in you
I sense the power
in the fingers
within an hour the power
can totally destroy me
or it could same my life
here is London
'home of the brash, outrageous
and free'
you are repressed
but you're remarkably dressed
is it Real?
but you're far to busy
busy scissors
busy clippers
hair dresser on fire
all around Sloane Square
and you're far too busy
to see me
"busy,busy"
hairdresser on fire
was a client over-cautious
he made you nervous
and when he said
"I'm gonna sue you"
I really felt for you
so can you squeeze me
into an empty page of your diary
and supernaturally change me
CHANGE ME, CHANGE ME

 

THE ORDINARY BOYS

Ordinary boys, happy knowing nothing
happy being no one, but themselves
Ordinary girls, supermarket clothes
who think it's very clever to be cruel to you
for you were so different
you stood all alone
and you knew
that it had to be so
avoiding ordinary boys
happy going nowhere, just around here
in their rattling cars
and ordinary girls
never seeing further
than the cold, small streets
that trap them
but you were so different
you had to say no
when those empty fools
tried to change you, and claim you
for the lair of their ordinary world
where they feel so lucky
so lucky, so lucky
with their lives laid out before them
they're so lucky, so lucky
so lucky, so lucky

 

I DON'T MIND IF YOU FORGET ME

I don't mind
I don't mind if you forget me
having learned my lesson
I never left an impression on anyone
so now you send me your hardened 'regards'
when once you'd send me 'love'
sincerely I must tell you
your mild 'best wishes'
they make me suspicious
but I don't mind
I don't mind if you forget me
having learned my lesson
I never left
an impression on anyone
the pressure to change, to move on
was strange
and very strong
so this is why I tell you
I really do understand
BYE BYE
I don't mind if you forget me
no no no no no no no
REJECTION IS ONE THING
BUT REJECTION FROM A FOOL
IS CRUEL
REJECTION IS ONE THING
BUT REJECTION FROM A FOOL
IS CRUEL
and I don't mind if you forget me
I don't mind if your forget me

 

DIAL-A-CLICHE

Further into the fog I fall
well, I was just
following you!
when you said:
"Do as I do and scrap your fey ways"
(dial-a-cliche)
"grow up, be a man, and close your mealy-mouth!"
(dial-a-cliche)
But the person underneath
where does he go?
does he slide by the wayside?
or...does he just die?
when you find that you've organized
your feelings, for people
who didn't like you then
and certainly don't like you now
yet still you say:
"Do as I do and scrap your fey ways"
(dial-a-cliche)
"grow up, be a man, and close your mealy-mouth!"
(dial-a-cliche)
"the Safe way is the only way!
there's always time to change, son!"
yes well I've changed
but I'm in pain!
dial-a-chiche

 

MARGARET ON THE GUILLOTINE

The kind people
have a wonderful dream
Margaret on the guillotine
because people like you
make me feel so tired
when will you die?
when will you die?
when will you die?
when will you die?
when will you die?
because people like you
make me feel so old inside
please die
and kind people
do not shelter this dream
make it real
make the dream real
make the dream real
make it real

 

OUR FRANK

Our frank and open
deep conversations
they get me nowhere
they bring me down, so
give it a rest, won't you?
give me a cigarette
God give me patience
just no more conversation
Give us a drink
and make it quick
or else I'm gonna be sick
sick all over
your frankly vulgar
red pullover
now see how the colours blend
Our frank and open
deep conversations
they get me nowhere
they bring me down, so
give it a rest, won't you?
now will you just give over
the world may be ending
but look, I'm only human
Give us a drink
and make it quick
or else I'm gonna be sick
all over
your frankly vulgar
red pullover
now see how the two colours blend
Won't somebody stop me
from thinking all the time
about everything
so deeply
so bleakly

 

ASIAN RUT

Day oh so late
strangely the sun still shone
oh Asian boy
what are you on?
Day oh so late
strangely the sun still shone
what drugs are you on?
Tooled-up Asian boy
has come here to avenge
the cruel, cold killing
of his very best friend
Tooled-up Asian boy
has come here to take revenge
for the cruel, cold killing
of his only friend
Peace through the school
so quiet in the hall
it's a strange sign for one
of what's to come
Tough and hard and pale
oh they may just impale you on railings
oh English boys
it must be wrong
three against one?
Brakes slammed, and
a gun jammed, and
as far as I could tell
brave Asian boy
dealt a blow and fell
I'm just passing through here
on my way to somewhere civilised
and maybe I'll even arrive
maybe I'll even arrive?

 

SING YOUR LIFE

Sing your life
any fool can think of words that rhyme
many others do
why don't you?
do you want to?
Sing your life
just walk right up to the microphone
and name
all the things that you love
all the things that you loathe
sing your life
all the things that you love
all the things that you loathe
oh sing your life
oh sing your life
Others sang your life
but now's your chance to shine
and have the pleasure of
saying what you mean
the rare pleasure of
meaning what you sing
oh, make no mistake, my friend
all of this will end
so sing it now
all the things you love
all the things you loathe
oh sing your life
all the things that you love
all the things that you loathe
oh sing your, oh sing your
Don't leave it all unsaid
somewhere in the wasteland of your head
and make no mistake, my friend
your pointless life will end
but before you go
can you look at the truth?
You have a lovely singing voice
a lovely singing voice
and all of those
who sing on key
they stole the notion
from you and me

 

MUTE WITNESS

Your poor witness
crying so loudly on the floor
oh but she's only trying to tell you
what it was that she saw
she is only trying to tell you
what it was that she saw
Now see her standing on the table
with her small arms flailing
and you feel such compassion
in your soul for
Your poor mute witness
still testing the strength
of our patience
oh but she's only trying to tell you
what it was that she saw
Now see her pointing to the frisbee
with a memory too fuzzy
as her silent words
describe the fright of last night
4 a.m. Norhtside, Clapham Common
who knows what she was doing there?
will she sketch the answer later?
Well, I'll ask her
"now dry your tears, my dear"
Now see her mime in time so nicely
it would all have been so clear
is only she had never volunteered
"your taxi is here, my dear"

 

KING LEER

Your boyfriend, he
went down on one knee
well, could it be
he's only got one knee?
I tried to surprise you
with Vodka
or, Tizer
I can't quite remember
but you didn't thank me
you didn't even thank me
because you never do
Your boyfriend, he
has the gift of the gab
or, could it be
the gift of the grab?
I tried to surprise you
I lay down beside you
and...nothing much happened
and you didn't phone me
you didn't even phone me
because it's not your style
to dial
Your boyfriend, he
displays to me
more than just
a hint of cruelty
I tried to surprise you
I crept up behind you
with a homeless chihuahua
you gushed for an hour
you handed him back and said
"You'll never guess
I'm bored now"

 

FOUND FOUND FOUND

found found found found found found
someone who's worth it
in this murkiness
someone who's never
seeming scheming
found found found found found found
someone who's worth it
in this murkiness
someone who's never
seeming scheming
Oh, but if I'd never found
oh, but if I'd never found
oh, but if I'd never found
I do believe that
the more you give your love
and I do believe that
the more you offer trust
the more you chase
the more you cry
the more you're bound to lose
the more you're bound to lose
Oh, but if I'd never found
oh, but if I'd never found
somebody
who wants to be
who wants to be
with me
all the time

 

DRIVING YOUR GIRLFRIEND HOME

I'm driving
your girlfriend home
and she's saying
how she never chose you
"turn left", she says
so I turn left
and she says
"So how did I end up
so deeply involved in
the very existence
I planned on avoiding?"
and I can't answer
I'm driving
your girlfriend home
and she's laughing
to stop herself crying
"drive on", she says
so I drive on
and she says
"So how did I end up
attached to this person
when his sense of humour
gets gradually worser?"
and I can't tell her
I'm parking
outside her home
and we're shaking hands
goodnight, so politely

 

THE HARSH TRUTH OF THE CAMERA EYE

Churchillian legs
hair barely there
the harsh truth of the camera eye
Your eyes signal pain
because of the strain
of smiling
the harsh truth of the camera eye
telling you all
that you never wnated to know
showing what
you didn't want shown
My so friendly lens
zooms into
"the inner you"
and it tells the harsh truth
and nothing but
Laugh with us all here
that's if you can
then take the pictures home
and screamtelling you all
that you never wanted to know
showing you what
you didn't want shown
This photographer
he must have really had it in for you
"Oh, I don't want
to be judged anymore
I don't wnat to be judged
I would sooner be Loved
I would sooner be
just blindly Loved..."

 

(I'M) THE END OF THE FAMILY LINE

With no complications
fifteen generations
(of mine)
all honouring Nature
until I arrive
(with incredible style)
I'm the end fo the line
the end of the family line
the end of the line
No baby pulled screaming
out into this seething whirl
by chance or whim
(or even love?)
our family tree hacked into decline
and I'm spared the pain
of ever saying
("goodbye")
I'm the end of the line
the end of the family line
the end of the line

 

THERE'S A PLACE IN HELL FOR ME AND MY FRIENDS

There is a place
reserved
for me and my friends
and when we go
we all will go
so you see
I'm never alone
there is a place
with a bit more time
and a few more
gentler words
and looking back
we do forgive
(we had no choice
we always did)
all that we hope
is that when we go
our skin
and our blood
and our bones
don't get in your way
making you ill
the way they did
when we lived
There is a place
a place in hell
reserved
for me and my friends
and if ever I
wanted to cry
then I will
because I can

 

TONY THE PONY

Still drinking on the corner 
Just don't say I didn't warn you 
Always nagging big brother 
He's only looking out for you 
Tony The Pony 
Tony The Pony 
You're still standing on the corner 
Just don't say I didn't warn you 
Old and jealous big brother 
You had your time and you spent it 
Crying 
Now, Tony The Pony 
Tony The Pony 
So, that's what they call you now ? 
When you're free outside 
So cold and hard and in control 
And ... 
There's a free ride on 
Tony The Pony 
Oh, why do you always wanna stop me 
From doing the things in life that make me happy ? 
And when I'm outside with friends, laughing loudly 
Why do you always wanna stop me ? 
Oh, I would never 
I would never 
But you will carry the can for anyone 
The free ride on 
Gullible Tony 
You're drunker quicker 
And you're sicker even quicker 
For something heavy is gonna fall on you 
Oh ... 
And what do they call you now ? 
When you're free outside 
So cold and hard and in control 
And, oh ... been a lark 
There's a free ride on 
Fucked-up Tony 
I will never say I told you so 
Or how I knew that something bad 
Would happen to you 
I don't wanna say I told you so 
Oh, but Tony, I told you so !!! 
I told you so

 

YOU'RE GONNA NEED SOMEONE ON YOUR SIDE

With the world's fate 
Resting on your shoulder 
You're gonna need 
Someone on your side 
You can't do it by yourself 
Any longer 
You're gonna need 
Someone on your side 
Someone kindly told me 
That you'd wasted 
Eight of nine lives
Oh, give yourself a break 
Before you break down 
You're gonna need someone on your side 
And here I am, And here I am 
Well, you don't need 
To look so pleased ! 
Day or night, 
There is no difference 
You're gonna need someone on your side 
Day or night, 
There is no difference 
You're gonna need someone soon 
And here I am, And here I am 
Well, you don't need 
To look so pleased

 

GLAMOROUS GLUE

First day with the jar 
You find 
Everyone lies 
First day with the jar 
You find 
Everyone lies, nobody minds 
Everyone lies 
Where is the man you respect ? 
And where is the woman you love ? 
Where's the woman you love ? 
Third week with the jar
You find 
Everything dies 
We won't vote Conservative 
Because we never have 
Everyone lies, everyone lies 
Where is the man you respect ? 
And where is the woman you love ? 
Where's the woman you love ? 
Everything of worth 
On Earth Is there To share 
I used to dream, and I used to vow 
I wouldn't dream of it now 
We look to Los Angeles 
For the language we use 
London is dead, London is dead, London is dead...
Now I'm too much in love 
I'm too much in love 
I know 
I'll go 
Empty hand 
From the land

 

WE'LL LET YOU KNOW

How sad are we ? 
And how sad have we been ? 
We'll let you know 
We'll let you know 
Oh, but only if - you're really interested 
You wonder how 
We've stayed alive 'till now 
We'll let you know 
We'll let you know 
But only if - you're really interested 
We're all smiles 
Then, honest, I swear, it's the turnstiles 
That make us hostile 
Oh ... 
We will descend 
On anyone unable to defend 
Themselves 
Oh ... 
And the songs we sing 
They're not supposed to mean a thing 
La, la, la, la ... 
Oh ...You're lonely, Oh ... you're lonely, Oh ... 
GET OFF THE ROOF ! Oh ... 
Your Arsenal !
We may seem cold, or 
We may even be 
The most depressing people you've ever known 
At heart, what's left, we sadly know 
That we are the last truly British people you'll ever know 
We are the last truly British people you will ever know 
You'll never never want to know

 

THE NATIONAL FRONT DISCO

David, the wind blows 
The wind blows ... 
Bits of your life away 
Your friends all say ... 
"Where is our boy ? Oh, we've lost our boy" 
But they should know 
Where you've gone 
Because again and again you've explained that 
You're going to ... 
Oh, you're going to ... 
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah 
England for the English ! 
England for the English ! 
David, the winds blow 
The winds blow ...
All of my dreams away 
And I still say : 
"Where is our boy ? Ah, we've lost our boy" 
But I should know 
Why you've gone 
Because again and again you've explained
You've gone to the ... 
National, ah ... 
To the National .. 
There's a country; you don't live there 
But one day you would like to 
And if you show them what you're made of 
Oh, then you might do ... 
But David, we wonder 
We wonder if the thunder 
Is ever really gonna begin 
Begin, begin 
Your mom says : 
"I've lost my boy" 
But she should know 
Why you've gone 
Because again and again you've explained 
You've gone to the : 
National 
To the National 
To the National Front Disco 
Because you want the day to come sooner 
You want the day to come sooner 
You want the day to come sooner 
When you've settled the score 
Oh, the National 
Oh, the National

 

CERTAIN PEOPLE I KNOW

I take the cue from 
Certain people I know 
I use the cue 
And then I 
Hand it on to you 
And when I swing it 
So, it catches his eye ... 
(Weren't you there ? 
- You'd have died !) 
I trust the views of 
Certain people I know 
They look at Danger 
And they 
LAUGH THEIR HEADS OFF 
Their clothes are Imitation 
George the 23rd 
(Don't you find this absurd ?) 
I'd hate to be like 
Certain people I know 
They break their necks 
And can't afford to
Get them fixed 
Ah, they'd sacrifice all 
Of their principles for 
anything cashable 
I do believe it's terrible 
Oh, wo, wo, Ah, ah, ah, ah, Oh, wo, wo...

 

WE HATE IT WHEN OUR FRIENDS BECOME SUCCESSFUL

We hate it when our friends become successful 
We hate it when our friends become successful 
Oh, look at those clothes 
Now look at that face, it's so old 
And such a video ! 
Well, it's really laughable 
Ha, ha, ha ...
We hate it when our friends become successful 
And if they're Northern, that makes it even worse
And if we can destroy them 
You bet your life we will 
Destroy them 
If we can hurt them 
Well, we may as well ... 
It's really laughable 
Ha, ha, ha ... 
You see, it should've been me 
It could've been me 
Everybody knows 
Everybody says so 
They say : 
"Ah, you have loads of songs 
So many songs 
More songs than they'd stand 
Verse 
Chorus 
Middle eight 
Break, fade 
Just listen ..."
La, la-la, la-la

 

YOU'RE THE ONE FOR ME, FATTY

You're the One for me, fatty 
You're the One I really, really love

SEASICK, YET STILL DOCKED

I am a poor freezingly cold soul 
So far from where 
I intended to go 
Scavenging through life's very constant lulls 
So far from where I'm determined to go 
Wish I knew the way to reach the one I love
There is no way ... 
Wish I had the charm to attract the one I love 
But you see, I've got no charm 
Mmm...
Tonight I've consumed much more than I can hold 
Oh, this is very clear to you 
And you can tell I have never really loved 
You can tell, by the way, I sleep all day
And all of my life no-one gave me anything 
No-one has ever given me anything 
My love is as sharp as a needle in your eye 
You must be such a fool 
To pass me by

 

I KNOW IT'S GONNA HAPPEN SOMEDAY

My love, wherever you are 
Whatever you are 
Don't lose faith 
I know it's gonna happen someday 
To you 
Please wait ... Please wait ... Oh ... Wait ... 
Don't lose faith 
You say that the day just never arrives 
And it's never seemed so far away 
Still, I know it's gonna happen someday 
To you 
Please wait ... 
Don't lose faith

 

TOMORROW

Tomorrow 
Will it really come ? 
And if it does come 
Will I still be Human ? 
All I ask of you is one thing that you never do 
Would you put your arms around me ? 
(I won't tell anyone) 
Tomorrow 
Does it have to come ?
All I ask of you is one thing that you'll never do 
Would you put your arms around me ? 
(I won't tell anybody) 
Tomorrow 
And what must come before ...
Oh, the pain in my arms 
Oh, the pain in my legs 
Ooh, my shiftless body 
Tomorrow 
It's surely nearer now ? 
You don't think I'll make it 
I never said I wanted to ! 
Well did I ? 
Oh, the pain in my arms 
Oh, the pain in my legs 
Oh, yeah; oh, yeah, No, yeah; no, yeah 
Through my shiftless body 
Tomorrow, Tomorrow 
All I ask of you ... oh ... 
Is : would you tell me that you love me 
Tell me, tell me that you love me, Tell me, tell me that you love me ... 
Ah, I know you don't mean it 
Ah, I know you don't mean it 
Tell me, tell me that you love me, Tell me, tell me that you love me ...

 

YOU'RE THE ONE FOR ME, FATTY

You're the One for me, fatty 
You're the One I really, really love 
And I will stay

CERTAIN PEOPLE I KNOW

I take the cue from 
Certain people I know 
I use the cue And then I 
Hand it on to you 
And when I swing it 
So, it catches his eye ... 
(Weren't you there ? 
- You'd have died !) 
I trust the views of 
Certain people I know 
They look at Danger 
And they 
LAUGH THEIR HEADS OFF 
Their clothes are Imitation 
George the 23rd 
(Don't you find this absurd ?) 
I'd hate to be like 
Certain people I know 
They break their necks 
And can't afford to
Get them fixed 
Ah, they'd sacrifice all 
Of their principles for 
anything cashable 
I do believe it's terrible 
Oh, wo, wo Ah, ah, ah, ah Oh, wo, wo...

 

THE NATIONAL FRONT DISCO

David, the wind blows 
The wind blows ... 
Bits of your life away 
Your friends all say ... 
"Where is our boy ? Oh, we've lost our boy" 
But they should know 
Where you've gone 
Because again and again you've explained that 
You're going to ... 
Oh, you're going to ... 
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah 
England for the English ! 
England for the English ! 
David, the winds blow 
The winds blow ...
All of my dreams away 
And I still say : 
"Where is our boy ? Ah, we've lost our boy" 
But I should know 
Why you've gone 
Because again and again you've explained
You've gone to the ... 
National, ah ... To the National .. 
There's a country; you don't live there 
But one day you would like to 
And if you show them what you're made of 
Oh, then you might do ... 
But David, we wonder 
We wonder if the thunder 
Is ever really gonna begin 
Begin, begin 
Your mom says : 
"I've lost my boy" 
But she should know 
Why you've gone 
Because again and again you've explained 
You've gone to the : 
National, To the National 
To the National Front Disco 
Because you want the day to come sooner 
You want the day to come sooner 
You want the day to come sooner 
When you've settled the score 
Oh, the National, Oh, the National…

 

NOVEMBER SPAWNED A MONSTER

Sleep on and dream of Love
because it's the closest you will get to love
poor twisted child, so ugly, so ugly
poor twisted child, oh hug me, oh hug me
one November spawned a monster 
in the shape of this child who later cried
"But Jesus made me, so Jesus save me from
pity, sympathy and people discussing me"
a frame of useless limbs what can make GOOD
all the BAD that's been done?
And if the lights were out
could you even bear
to kiss her full on the mouth (or anywhere?)
poor twisted child, so ugly, so ugly
poor twisted child, oh hug me, oh hug me
one November spawned a monster 
in the shape of this child who must remain
a hostage to kindess and the wheels underneath her
a hostage to kindess and the wheels underneath her
a symbol of where mad, mad lovers
must PAUSE and draw the line
So sleep and dream of love
because it's the closest
you will get to love
that November is a time which I must put OUT of my mind
oh one fine day 
LET IT BE SOON
she won't be rich or beautiful
but she'll be walking your streets
in the clothes that she went out
and chose for herself

 

SEASICK, YET STILL DOCKED

I am a poor freezingly cold soul 
So far from where 
I intended to go 
Scavenging through life's very constant lulls 
So far from where I'm determined to go 
Wish I knew the way to reach the one I love
There is no way ... 
Wish I had the charm to attract the one I love 
But you see, I've got no charm 
Mmm...
Tonight I've consumed much more than I can hold 
Oh, this is very clear to you 
And you can tell I have never really loved

THE LOOP

I just wanna say 
I haven't been away 
I'm still right here 
Where I always was 
So one day, if you're bored 
By all means call 
Because you can do 
(But only if you want to) 
I just wanna say 
I haven't been away 
I am still right here 
Where I always was 
So one day, when you're bored 
By all means call 
Because you can do 
But you might not get through

 

SISTER I'M A POET

All over this town 
Yes, a low wind may blow 
And I can see through everybo... 
With no reason 
To hide these words I feel 
And no reason 
To talk about the books I read 
But still I do 
That's 'cause I'm a ... Sister I'm a ... 
All over this town 
Along this way 
Outside the prison gates 
I love the romance of crime 
And I wonder 
Does anybody feel the way I do ? 
And is evil just something you are 
Or something you do ? 
Sister I'm a ... Sister I'm a ... 
All over this town, All over this town 
They pull over 
In their Citroen vans 
Not to shake your hand 
With meths on their breaths 
And you with youth on your side 
A plastic bag stranded at the lights 
This once was me ...
But now I'm a ... Sister I'm a ...
All over this town ... Oh, oh, oh 
All over this town, All over this town, Oh ... 
I still cannot speak French ... I am very lazy

 

JACK THE RIPPER

Oh, you look so tired 
Mouth slack and wide 
Ill-housed and ill-advised 
Your face is as mean 
As your life has been 
Crash into my arms 
I WANT YOU 
You don't agree -
But you don't refuse 
I know you 
And I know a place 
Where no one is likely to pass 
Oh, you don't care if it's late 
And you don't care if you're lost 
And oh, you look so tired 
(But tonight you presumed too much) 
Too much, too much 
And if it's the last 
Thing I ever do 
I'M GONNA GET YOU 
Crash into my arms 
I WANT YOU 
You don't agree -
But you don't refuse 
I know you 
And no one knows a thing about my life 
I can come and go as I please 
And if I want to, I can stay 
Oh, or if I want to, I can leave 
Nobody knows me, Nobody knows me, Nobody knows me Oh, oh...

 

SUCH A LITTLE THING MAKES SUCH A BIG DIFFERENCE

Such a little thing, such a little thing
but the difference it made was grave
there you go
wielding a bicycle chain
oh why won't you change
cange and be nicer?
such a little thing
a gentle tone of kindness
or written words on paper
- can you write?
How I love all of
the very simple things of life
(God's good air)
how I love all of
the very simple things of life
such a little thing
a fumbling politeness
the difference it saved me
wielding a bicycle chain
"I WILL NOT CHANGE AND I WILL NOT BE NICE"
Most people keep their brains between your legs (don't you find?)
Leave me alone - I was only singing, leave me alone because
I was only singing
leave me alone - I was only singing, leave me alone
you have just proved (again)
MOST PEOPLE KEEP THEIR BRAINS BETWEEN THEIR LEGS

 

I KNOW IT'S GONNA HAPPEN SOMEDAY

My love, wherever you are 
Whatever you are 
Don't lose faith 
I know it's gonna happen someday 
To you 
Please wait ... 
Please wait ... 
Oh ... Wait ... 
Don't lose faith 
You say that the day just never arrives 
And it's never seemed so far away 
Still, I know it's gonna happen someday 
To you 
Please wait ... 
Don't lose faith

 

WE'LL LET YOU KNOW

How sad are we ? 
And how sad have we been ? 
We'll let you know, We'll let you know 
Oh, but only if - you're really interested 
You wonder how 
We've stayed alive 'till now 
We'll let you know, We'll let you know 
But only if - you're really interested 
We're all smiles 
Then, honest, I swear, it's the turnstiles 
That make us hostile 
Oh ... We will descend 
On anyone unable to defend 
Themselves 
Oh ... And the songs we sing 
They're not supposed to mean a thing 
La, la, la, la ... Oh ...
You're lonely, Oh ... you're lonely 
Oh ... 
GET OFF THE ROOF !
Oh ... Your Arsenal !
We may seem cold, or 
We may even be 
The most depressing people you've ever known 
At heart, what's left, we sadly know 
That we are the last truly British people you'll ever know 
We are the last truly British people you will ever know 
You'll never never want to know

 

SUEDHEAD

Why do you come here
why do you hang around
I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry
Why do you come here
when you know it makes
things hard for me
when you know, oh
why do you come?
Why do you telephone?
and why send me silly notes?
I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry
why do you come here
when you know it makes
thing hard for me
when you know, oh
why do you come?
You had to sneak into my room
'just' to read my diary
was it just to see all the things
you knew I'd written about you?
and...so many illustrations
I'm so very sickened
oh, I am so sickened NOW

 

HE KNOWS I'D LOVE TO SEE HIM

He Knows (he knows)
Or, I think he does
because when I lived
in the Arse of the world...
he knows, he knows, he knows I'd love
to see him happy (or as close as is allowed)
because when I lived
in the Arse of the world
he knows, he knows, he knows I'd love
to see him happy (or as close as possible
as close as possible, as close as is allowed)
My name still conjours up deadly deeds
and a bad taste in the mouth
the police - they actually knew me
they said:
"You're just another person in the world
you're just another fool with radical views
you're just another who has maddening views
you want to turn it on its head
by staying in bed!"
I said: "I know I do"

 

YOU'RE GONNA NEED SOMEONE ON YOUR SIDE

With the world's fate 
Resting on your shoulder 
You're gonna need 
Someone on your side 
You can't do it by yourself 
Any longer 
You're gonna need 
Someone on your side 
Someone kindly told me 
That you'd wasted 
Eight of nine lives
Oh, give yourself a break 
Before you break down 
You're gonna need someone on your side 
And here I am, And here I am 
Well, you don't need 
To look so pleased ! 
Day or night, 
There is no difference 
You're gonna need someone on your side 
Day or night, 
There is no difference 
You're gonna need someone soon 
And here I am, And here I am 
Well, you don't need 
To look so pleased

 

GLAMOROUS GLUE

First day with the jar 
You find 
Everyone lies 
First day with the jar 
You find 
Everyone lies, nobody minds, Everyone lies 
Where is the man you respect ? 
And where is the woman you love ? 
Where's the woman you love ? 
Third week with the jar
You find 
Everything dies 
We won't vote Conservative 
Because we never have 
Everyone lies, everyone lies 
Where is the man you respect ? 
And where is the woman you love ? 
Where's the woman you love ? 
Everything of worth 
On Earth, Is there, To share 
I used to dream, and I used to vow 
I wouldn't dream of it now 
We look to Los Angeles 
For the language we use 
London is dead, London is dead, London is dead, ...
Now I'm too much in love 
I'm too much in love, 
I know I'll go 
Empty hand 
From the land

 

WE HATE IT WHEN OUR FRIENDS BECOME SUCCESSFUL

We hate it when our friends become successful 
We hate it when our friends become successful 
Oh, look at those clothes 
Now look at that face, it's so old 
And such a video ! 
Well, it's really laughable 
Ha, ha, ha ...
We hate it when our friends become successful 
And if they're Northern, that makes it even worse
And if we can destroy them 
You bet your life we will 
Destroy them 
If we can hurt them 
Well, we may as well ... 
It's really laughable 
Ha, ha, ha ... 
You see, it should've been me 
It could've been me 
Everybody knows 
Everybody says so 
They say : 
"Ah, you have loads of songs 
So many songs 
More songs than they'd stand 
Verse 
Chorus 
Middle eight 
Break, fade 
Just listen ..."
La, la-la, la-la

 

NOW MY HEART IS FULL

There's gonna be some trouble 
A whole house will need re-building 
And everyone I love in the house 
Will recline on an analyst's couch quite 
Soon 
Your Father cracks a joke 
And in the usual way 
Empties the room 
Tell all of my friends 
(I don't have too many 
Just some rain-coated lovers' puny brothers)
Dallow, Spicer, Pinkie, Cubitt 
Rush to danger 
Wind up nowhere 
Patric Doonan - raised to wait 
I'm tired again, I've tried again, and 
Now my heart is full 
Now my heart is full 
And I just can't explain 
So I won't even try to
Dallow, Spicer, Pinkie, Cubitt 
Every jammy Stressford poet 
Loafing oafs in all-night chemists 
Loafing oafs in all-night chemists 
Underact - express depression 
Ah, but Bunnie I loved you 
I was tired again 
I've tried again, and 
Now my heart is full 
Now my heart is full 
And I just can't explain 
So I won't even try to 
Could you pass by ? 
Could you pass by ? 
Oh ... 
Now my heart is full 
Now my heart is full 
And I just can't explain 
So ... slow ... 
Slow ... slow ... slow ... slow ... slow ...

 

SPRING-HEELED JIM

Spring-heeled Jim winks an eye 
He'll "do", he'll never be "done to" 
He takes on whoever flew through 
"Well, it's the normal thing to do" ... ah ... 
Spring-heeled Jim lives to love 
Now kissing with his mouth full 
And his eyes on some other fool 
So many women 
His head should be spinning 
Ah, but no ! 
Ah, but no ! 
But no !
Ah, no !
Spring-heeled Jim slurs the words : 
"There's no need to be so knowing
Take life at five times the 
Average speed, like I do" 
Until Jim feels the chill 
"Oh, where did all the time go ?" 
Once always in for the kill 
Now it's too cold 
And he feels too 
old 
Too old
Mmm, old... 
La, la, la, la-la, la ...

 

BILLY BUDD

Say, Billy Budd 
So you think you should ? 
Oh, everyone's laughing 
Say, Billy Budd 
So you think that you should ? 
Everyone's laughing ! 
Since I took up with you 
Things have been bad 
Yeah, but now it's 12 years on 
Now it's 12 years on 
Yes, and I took up with you 
I took my job application 
Into town 
Did you hear ? They turned me down 
Yes, and it's all because of us 
Oh, and what was in our eyes 
Oh, what was in our eyes, yeah 
I said, Billy Budd 
I would happily lose 
Both of my legs 
I would lose both of my legs 
Oh, if it meant you could be free 
Oh, if it meant you could be free 
(Don't leave us in the dark!)

 

HOLD ON TO YOUR FRIENDS

A bond of trust 
Has been abused 
Something of value 
May be lost 
Give up your job 
Squander your cash - be rash 
Just hold on to your friends 
There are more than enough 
To fight and oppose 
Why waste good time 
Fighting the people you like 
Who will fall defending your name 
Oh, don't feel so ashamed 
To have friends 
But now you only call me 
When you're feeling depressed 
When you feel happy I'm 
So far from your mind 
My patience is stretched 
My loyalty vexed 
Oh, you're losing all of your friends 
Hold on to your friends 
Hold on to your friends 
Resist - or move on 
Be mad, be rash 
Smoke and explode 
Sell all of your clothes 
Just bear in mind : 
Oh, there just might come a time 
When you need some friends

 

THE MORE YOU IGNORE ME, THE CLOSER I GET

The more you ignore me 
The closer I get 
You're wasting your time 
The more you ignore me 
The closer I get 
You're wasting your time 
I will be 
In the bar 
With my head 
On the bar 
I am now 
A central part 
Of your mind's landscape 
Whether you care 
Or do not 
Yeah, I've made up your mind 
The more you ignore me 
The closer I get 
You're wasting your time 
The more you ignore me 
The closer I get 
You're wasting your time 
Beware !
I bear more grudges 
Than lonely high court judges 
When you sleep 
I will creep 
Into your thoughts 
Like a bad debt 
That you can't pay 
Take the easy way 
And give in 
Yeah, and let me in 
Oh, let me in 
Oh let me ... 
Oh, let me in 
IT'S WAR 
IT'S WAR 
WAR 
WAR 
Oh, let me in 
Ah, the closer I get 
Ah, you're asking for it 
Ah, the closer I get 
Ooh, the closer I ...

 

WHY DON'T YOU FIND OUT FOR YOURSELF

The sanest days are mad 
Why don't you find out for yourself ? 
Then you'll see the price 
Very closely 
Some men here 
They have a special interest 
In your career 
They wanna help you to grow 
And then syphon all your dough 
Why don't you find out for yourself ? 
Then you'll see the glass 
Hidden in the grass 
You'll never believe me, so 
Why don't you find out for yourself ? 
Sick down to my heart 
That's just the way it goes 
Some men here 
They know the full extent of 
Your distress 
They kneel and pray 
And they say : 
"Long may it last" 
Why don't you find out for yourself ?
Then you'll see the glass 
Hidden in the grass 
Bad scenes come and go 
For which you must allow 
Sick down to my heart 
That's just the way it goes 
Don't rake up my mistakes 
I know exactly what they are 
And ... what do YOU do ? 
Well ... you just SIT THERE 
I've been stabbed in the back 
So many many times 
I don't have any skin 
But that's just the way it goes

 

I AM HATED FOR LOVING

I am hated for loving 
I am hated for loving 
Anonymous call, a poison pen 
A brick in the small of the back again 
I still don't belong 
To anyone - I am mine 
And I am hated for loving 
I am haunted for wanting 
Anonymous call, a poison pen 
A brick in the ... ah ... 
A brick in the small of the back again 
I still don't belong 
To anyone - I am mine 
I am falling 
With no-one to catch me 
I am falling 
And there's still 
No-one to catch me 
Ah .. 
Anonymous call, a poison pen 
A brick in the ... ah ... 
A brick in the small of the back again 
I just don't belong 
To anywhere 
I just don't belong 
Mmm ... 
Ah ...

 

LIFEGUARD SLEEPING, GIRL DROWNING

Always looking for attention 
Always needs to be mentioned 
Who does she 
Think she should be ? 
The shrill cry through darkening air 
Doesn't she know he's 
Had such a busy day ? 
Tell her ... sshhh
Somebody tell her ... sshhh 
Slowest ... 
It was only a test 
But she swam too far 
Against the tide 
She deserves all she gets 
The sky became marked with stars 
As an out-stretched arm slowly 
Disappears 
Hooray 
Oh hooray 
No, oh, oh, woh, there's no movement 
No, oh, hooray 
Oh, hooray 
Please don't worry 
There'll be no fuss 
She was ... nobody's nothing 
(What's your name ?) 
When he awoke 
The sea was calm 
And another day passes like a dream 
There's no ... no way 
(What's your name ?)

 

USED TO BE A SWEET BOY

Used to be a sweet boy 
Holding so tightly 
To Daddy's hand 
But that was all 
In some distant land 
Blazer and tie 
And a big bright healthy smile 
Used to make all 
Of our trials worthwhile 
Used to be a sweet boy 
And I'm not to blame 
Something went wrong 
And I know 
I'm not to blame 
Something went wrong 
Can't be to blame 
Ah ...

 

THE LAZY SUNBATHERS

A world war 
Was announced 
Days ago 
But they didn't know 
The lazy sunbathers 
The lazy sunbathers 
The sun burns through 
To the planet's core 
And it isn't enough 
They want more 
Nothing 
Appears 
To be 
Between the ears of 
The lazy sunbathers 
Too jaded 
To question stagnation 
The sun burns through 
To the planet's core 
And it isn't enough 
They want more 
Religions fall 
Children shelled 
"...Children shelled ? That's all 
Very well, but would you 
Please keep the noise 
Down low ? 
Because you're waking 
The lazy sunbathers ..."
Oh, the lazy sunbathers 
The lazy sunbathers

 

SPEEDWAY

And when you slam 
Down the hammer 
Can you see it in your heart ? 
All of the rumours 
Keeping me grounded 
I never said, I never said that they were 
Completely unfounded 
So when you slam 
Down the hammer 
Can you see it in your heart ? 
Can you delve so low ? 
And when you're standing 
On my fingers 
Can you see it in your heart ? ... ah ... 
And when you try 
To break my spirit 
It won't work 
Because there's nothing left to break 
Anymore 
All of the rumours 
Keeping me grounded 
I never said, I never said that they were 
Completely unfounded 
You won't sleep 
Until the earth that wants me 
Finally has me 
Oh you've done it now 
You won't rest 
Until the hearse that becomes me 
Finally takes me 
Oh you've done it now 
And you won't smile 
Until my loving mouth 
Is shut good and proper 
FOREVER 
All of the rumours 
Keeping me grounded 
I never said, I never said that they were 
Completely unfounded 
And all those lies 
Written lies, twisted lies 
Well, they weren't lies 
They weren't lies 
They weren't lies 
I never said 
I never said 
I could have mentioned your name 
I could have dragged you in 
Guilt by implication 
By association 
I've always been true to you 
In my own strange way 
I've always been true to you 
In my own sick way 
I'll always stay true to you

 

THE TEACHERS ARE AFRAID OF THE PUPILS

There's too many people 
Planning your downfall 
When your spirit's on trial 
These nights can be frightening 
Sleep transports sadness 
To some other mid-brain 
And somebody here 
Will not be here next year 
So you stand by the board 
Full of fear and intention 
And, if you think that they're listening 
Well, you've got to be joking 
Oh, you understand change 
And you think it's essential 
But when your profession 
Is humiliation 
Say the wrong word to our children ...
We'll have you, oh yes, we'll have you 
Lay a hand on our children 
And it's never too late to have you 
Mucus on your collar 
A nail up through the staff chair 
A blade in your soap 
And you cry into your pillow 
To be finished would be a relief 
To be finished would be a relief... 
Say the wrong word to our children ...
We'll have you, oh yes, we'll have you 
Lay a hand on our children 
And it's never too late to have you 
To be finished would be a relief 
To be finished would be a relief...
I'm very glad this thing has come 
Sometimes I'm so glad 
Never bother to play the tunes 
I've seen it coming for dear life

 

READER MEET AUTHOR

You don't know a thing about their lives 
They live where you wouldn't dare to drive
You shake as you think of how they sleep 
But you write as if you are my side-by-side 
Reader, meet Author 
With the hope of hearing sense 
But you may be feeling let down 
By the words of defence 
He says : "No-one ever sees me when I cry"
You don't know a thing about their lives 
Books don't save them, books aren't Stanley knives 
And if a fight broke out here tonight 
You'd be the first away, because you're that type 
And the Year 2000 won't change anyone here 
As each fabled promise flies so fast 
You'll swear it was never there 
Oh, have you ever escaped from a shipwrecked life ? 
So safely with your software; all miles from the front line 
You hear the way their sad voices, and you start to imagine things 
Oh, any excuse to write more lies

 

THE BOY RACER

He's just too good-natured and 
He's got too much money and 
He's got too many girlfriends 
I'm jealous, that's all 
Have you seen him go, though, oh ? 
Have you seen him go, though, oh ? 
Boy racer, Boy racer, oh 
We're gonna kill this pretty thing 
Boy racer, Boy racer, oh 
We're gonna kill this pretty thing

Have you seen him go, though, oh ? 
Boy racer, Boy racer, oh 
We're gonna kill this pretty thing 
Boy racer, Boy racer, oh 
We're gonna kill this pretty thing 
He thinks he got the whole world in his hands 
Stood at the urinal 
He thinks he got the whole world in his hands 
And I'm gonna ... kill him !
Oh, no ! Oh, no ! Oh, no ! Oh, no ! Oh, no !Oh .... 
Boy racer Boy racer, oh 
We're gonna kill this pretty thing...
He's just too good-looking, and, And, and ... 
Boy racer Boy racer, oh 
We're gonna kill this pretty thing...

 

THE OPERATION

You fight with your right hand 
And caress with your left hand 
Everyone I know is sick to death of you 
With a tear that's a mile wide 
In the kite that you're flying 
Everyone I know is sick to death of you 
Ever since 
You don't look the same 
You're just not the same, no way 
You say clever things and 
You never used to 
You don't catch what I'm saying 
When you're deafened to advice 
Everyone here is sick to the 
Back teeth of you 
With a tear that's a mile wide 
In the kite that you're flying 
Everyone here is sick to the 
Tattoo of you 
Ever since 
You don't look the same 
You're just not the same, no way 
You say pleasant things and 
There is no need to
Still, you fight with your right hand 
And caress with your left hand 
Ooh, ooh ... Sad to say ... 
How once I was in love with you 
Sad to say ... 
You don't catch what I'm saying 
When you're deafened to advice 
Ooh, ooh ... Ever since 
You don't look the same 
You're just not the same, no way 
What the hell have 
They stuck into you ?

 

DAGENHAM DAVE

Head in the clouds, and a mouthful of pie 
Head in a blouse, everybody loves him 
I see why 
Dagenham Dave, Dagenham Dave, Oh, Dagenham Dave 
Dagenham Dave, Dagenham Dave, Oh, Dagenham Dave 
"I love Karen, I love Sharon" on the windowscreen 
With never the need to fight or to question a single thing 
Dagenham Dave, Dagenham Dave Oh, Dagenham Dave 
Dagenham Dave, Dagenham Dave Oh, Dagenham Dave ...
He'd love to touch, he's afraid that he might self-combust 
I could say more, but you get the general idea 
Dagenham Dave, Dagenham Dave Dagenham Dave, Dagenham Dave 
Dagenham, Dagenham Dagenham Dave, Dagenham Dave ...
Oh, Dave, oh, Dagenham, dagenham, Oh, Dave, oh, Dave, ...

 

DO YOUR BEST AND DON'T WORRY

Compare the best of their days 
With the worst of your days 
You won't win 
With your standards so high 
And your spirits so low 
At least remember ... 
This is you on a bad day, you on a pale day 
Just do your best and don't ... Don't worry, oh 
The way you hang yourself is oh, so unfair 
See the best of how they look 
Against the worst of how you are
And again, you won't win 
With your standards so high 
And your spirits so low 
At least remember ... 
This is you on a drab day, you in a drab dress 
Just do your best and don't ... Don't worry, oh 
The way you hang yourself is oh, so unfair 
Just do your best and don't ... Don't worry, oh 
The way you watch yourself is oh, so unfair 
Just do your best and don't ... Don't worry, oh 
Do your best and don't ...

SOUTHPAW

You were a boy before you became a man 
I don't see the joy 
And you ran with your pals in the sun 
You turned around and they were gone 
Again ... 
A sick boy should be treated 
So easily defeated 
Oh, I just don't understand 
So you ran with your pals in the sun 
You turned around 
You were alone 
Again ... 
And you ran back to Ma 
Which set the pace for the rest of your days 
Oh, you ran back to Ma 
Which set the pace for the rest of your days 
Oh, you ran back to Ma 
Which set the pace for the rest of your days 
And now, there is something that you should know 
There is something that you should know 
The girl of your dreams is 
Here all alone 
Girl of your dreams is 
Here all alone 
The girl of your dreams is 
Sad and all alone 
The girl of your dreams is 
Here all alone 
There is something that you should know 
There is something that you should know 
Girl of your dreams is 
Here all alone 
The girl of your dreams is 
Sad and is all alone 
The girl of your dreams is 
Sad and is feeling all alone 
Oh, there is something that you should know 
Help me, help me, help me ...

 

MALADJUSTED

I wanna start from 
Before the beginning 
Loot wine, "Be mine, and 
Then let's stay out for the night"
Ride via Parkside 
Semi-perilous lives 
Jeer the lights in the windows 
Of all safe and stable homes 
(But wondering then, well what 
Could peace of mind be like ?)
Anyway do you want to hear 
Our story, or not ? 
As the Fulham Road lights 
Stretch and invite into the night 
From a Stevenage overspill 
We'd kill to live around 
SW6 - with someone like you 
Keep thieves' hours 
With someone like you 
...As long as it slides 
You stalk the house 
In a low-cut blouse : 
"Oh Christ, another stifled 
Friday night !"
And the Fulham Road lights 
Stretch and invite into the night 
Well, I was fifteen 
What could I know ?
When the gulf between 
All the things I need 
And the things I receive 
Is an ancient ocean 
Wide, wild, lost, uncrossed 
Still I maintain there's nothing 
Wrong with you 
You do all that you do 
Because it's all you can do 
Well, I was fifteen 
Where could I go ?
With a soul full of loathing 
For stinging bureaucracy 
Making it anything 
Other than easy 
For working girls like me 
With my hands on my head 
I flop on your bed 
With a head full of dread 
For all I've ever said 
Maladjusted, maladjusted 
Maladjusted maladjusted 
Never to be trusted 
Oh, never to be trusted 
There's nothing wrong with you, oh 
...There's nothing wrong with you

 

ALMA MATTERS

So : the choice I have made 
May seem strange to you 
But who asked you, anyway ? 
It's my life to wreck 
My own way 
You see : to someone, somewhere, oh yeah ... 
Alma matters 
In mind, body and soul 
In part, and in whole 
Because to someone, somewhere, oh yeah ... 
Alma matters 
In mind, body and soul 
In part, and in whole 
So the life I have made 
May seem wrong to you 
But, I've never been surer 
It's my life to ruin 
My own way 
You see : to someone, somewhere, oh yeah ... 
Alma matters 
In mind, body and soul 
In part, and in whole 
Because to someone, somewhere, oh yeah ... 
Alma matters 
In mind, body and soul 
In part, and in whole 
To someone, somewhere, oh yeah ... 
Alma matters 
In mind, body and soul 
Part, and in whole 
So to someone, somewhere, oh yeah ... 
Alma matters 
In mind, body and soul 
Part, and in whole 
To someone, somewhere, oh yeah ... 
Oh yeah ... Oh yeah, oh yeah Oh yeah ...

 

AMBITIOUS OUTSIDERS

Bolt-lock your doors 
Alarm your cars 
And still we move in closer 
Every day 
Top of the list 
Is your smiling kids 
But we'll be smiling too 
So that's OK 
Oh, and by the way 
Thank you, because you're 
Giving, giving, giving 
And we're receiving - 
No, no, we're taking 
Keeping the population down 
Your taxes paid, but 
Police waylaid 
And we knows 
When the school bus 
Comes and goes 
We're on your street, but 
You don't see us 
Or, if you do 
You smile and say Hello 
BUT DON'T UNDERESTIMATE US 
When you are 
Giving, giving, giving 
And we're receiving - 
No, no, we're taking 
Just keeping 
The population down 
You're giving, giving, giving 
Well, it's your own fault 
For reproducing 
We're just keeping 
The population down

 

TROUBLE LOVES ME

Trouble loves me 
Trouble needs me 
Two things 
More than you do 
Or would attempt to 
So, console me 
Otherwise, hold me 
Just when it seems like 
Everything's evened out 
And the balance 
Seems serene 
Trouble loves me 
Walks beside me 
To chide me 
Not to guide me 
It's still much more 
Than you'll do 
So, console me 
Otherwise, hold me 
Just when it seems like 
Everything's evened out 
And the balance seems serene 
See the fool I'll be 
Still running 'round 
On the flesh rampage 
Still running 'round 
Ready with ready-wit 
Still running 'round 
On the flesh rampage 
- At your age ! 
Go to Soho, oh 
Go to waste in 
The wrong arms 
Still running 'round 
Trouble loves me 
Seeks and finds me 
To charlatanize me 
Which is only 
As it should be 
Oh, please fulfill me 
Otherwise, kill me 
Show me a barrel and watch me scrape it 
Faced with the music, as always I'll face it 
In the half-light 
So English, frowning 
Then at midnight I 
Can't get you out of my head 
A disenchanted taste 
Still running 'round 
A disenchanted taste 
Still running 'round

 

PAPA JACK

Papa Jack 
Wants to turn 
Back the clock 
And reach out 
To the kids 
He once had 
Who have flown 
Papa Jack 
In decline 
Feels inclined 
To reach out 
To the kids 
He once had 
Who have flown 
But there was a time 
When the kids reached up 
And Papa Jack just 
Pushed them away 
Looking deep 
In his heart 
Papa Jack 
Doesn't like 
What he sees 
Or the time 
On his hands 
The dying day 
The chilly sun 
Papa Jack 
All alone 
Sings slow 
Grieving and low 
But there was a time 
When the kids reached up 
Now you can't always 
Have it your way 
Papa Jack 
Ah ...

 

AMMUNITION

I know these roads 
Each ridge 
And narrow bridge 
Each cheveron 
Enticing me on 
Each warning sign 
I take in my stride 
I don't need more ammunition 
I've got more than I can spend 
I don't dwell on things I'm missing 
I'm just pleased 
With the things I've found 
I know these roads 
An old hand understands 
Above all, I know what's 
Expected of me now 
Veering cliffwards 
I don't need more ammunition 
I've got more than I can spend 
I don't dwell on things I'm missing 
I'm just pleased 
With the things I've found 
With the things I've found 
With the things I've found 
I've found 
I've been crying 
It comes back on these salient days 
And it stays 
And it says : 
"We've never really been away" 
I don't need more ammunition 
I've got more than I can spend 
I don't think of who I'm missing 
I've got no space and no time 
In my life, anymore 
No space or time 
In my life, anymore 
For Revenge

 

WIDE TO RECEIVE

Download something 
Useful, or useless 
Because I'm lying here 
Wide to receive 
Almost anything 
You'd care to give 
And I don't 
Get along with myself 
And I'm not too keen 
On anyone else 
Turn on, plug in 
Then just walk away 
Unlock, process 
And then just go 
And I've never felt quite so alone 
As I do right now 
I'm lying here 
Wide to receive 
Almost anything 
You'd care to leave 
Wide, wide, wide Wide, wide, wide...

 

ROY'S KEEN

(GO ON !)
He's romancing you 
And chancing his arm 
He'll be here 
Smiling on time 
He's romancing you 
And chancing his arm 
He'll be here 
Smiling on time 
Roy's keen oh Roy's keen 
Roy's keen oh Roy's keen 
We've never seen a 
Keener window-cleaner 
Back up the ladder 
Into each corner 
Dunking the chamois 
Just think of the goodwill 
The ladder's a planet 
Roy is a star, and 
I am a satellite 
(But that's alright) 
He can hold a smile for as long 
As you require (even longer) 
He can hold a smile for as long 
As you require (even longer) 
Roy's keen oh Roy's keen 
Roy's keen oh Roy's keen 
We've never seen a 
Keener window-cleaner 
Back up the ladder 
Into each corner 
Dunking the chamois 
Just think of the goodwill 
The ladder's a planet 
Roy is a star, and 
I am a satellite 
I will be set alight 
Don't say you'll hold it steady 
Then you let it go 
Don't say you'll hold it steady 
Then you let it go Oh ...
You're up the ladder 
Into each corner 
Foot in a bucket 
We trust you to wreck it 
Even when it's under your nose 
Well, you just can't 
See it, can you ? 
Well, it's here 
Right under your nose 
And you just can't 
See it, can you? La la la la ...
Roy's keen, Roy's keen La la la la ...
We've never seen a 
Keener window-cleaner 
Oh ... La la la la ...

 

HE CRIED

I need you 
Simple words 
But words which had never been heard 
By the soul 
Stoned to death 
But still living 
And so he froze where he stood 
And he looked to the ground 
And he cried 
He cried 
Ride our minds 
If you must 
But there's always a line you don't cross 
Time is short 
Don't be cruel 
Oh you don't know the power 
In what you're saying 
Oh ... 
And so he froze where he stood 
And he looked to the ground 
And he cried 
He cried 
People where 
I come from 
They survive without feelings or blood 
I never could 
Was stoned to death 
But I'm still living 
So he froze where he stood 
And he looked to the ground 
And he cried 
He cried 
So he froze 
And he looked, and he looked 
To the ground 
And he cried 
He cried

 

SORROW WILL COME IN THE END

Legalized theft 
Leaves me bereft 
I get it straight in the neck 
(Somehow expecting no less) 
A court of justice 
With no use for Truth 
Lawyer ...liar 
Lawyer ...liar 
You pleaded and squealed 
And you think you've won 
But Sorrow will come 
To you in the end 
And as sure as my words are pure 
I praise the day that brings you pain 
Q.C.'s obsessed with sleaze 
Frantic for Fame 
They're all on the game 
They just use a different name 
You lied 
And you were believed 
By a J.P. senile and vile 
You pleaded and squealed 
And you think you've won 
But Sorrow will come 
To you in the end 
And as sure as my words are pure 
I praise the day that brings you pain 
So don't close your eyes 
Don't close your eyes 
A man who slits throats 
Has time on his hands 
And I'm gonna get you 
So don't close your eyes 
Don't ever close your eyes 
You think you've won 
OH NO

 

SATAN REJECTED MY SOUL

Satan rejected my soul 
He knows my kind 
He won't be dragged down 
He's seen my face around 
He knows Heaven doesn't seem 
To be my home 
So I must find 
Somewhere else to go 
So I must find 
Somewhere else to go 
So, take it - please 
It's free 
You'll never see 
You'll never see 
All the fun in life it's cost me 
Satan rejected my soul 
As low as he goes 
He never quite goes this low 
He's seen my face around 
He knows Heaven doesn't seem 
To be my home 
So I must find 
Somewhere else to go 
So I must find 
Somewhere else to go 
So, take it please 
It's really sly 
Come on, come on, ah Come on, come on, come on 
Take it please, It's really sly 
Come on, come on, ah Come on, come on, come on 
Call me in, Pull me in, call me in 
Come on, come on, oh Come on, come on, come on 
Pull me in, pull me in, Call me in, haul me in, pull me in 
Come on, come on, ah, Come on, come on 
La la la la la, Oh ...

 
 REEL AROUND THE FOUNTAIN

It's time the tale was told
of how you took a child
and you made him old
Reel around the fountain
slap me on the patio
I'll take it now
Fifteen minutes with you
well, I wouldn't say no
people said that you were virtually dead
and they were so wrong
fifteen minutes with you
well, i wouldn't say no
people said that you were easily led
and they were half-right
I dreamt about you last night
and i fell out of bed twice
you can pin and mount me like a butterfly
but take me to the haven of your bed
was something that you never said
two lumps, please
you're the bee's knees
but so am I
Meet me at the fountain
shove me on the patio
I'll take it slowly
Fifteen minutes with you
oh I wouldn't say no
people see no worth in you
oh but I do

 

YOU'VE GOT EVERYTHING NOW

As merry as the days were long
I was right and you were wrong
back at the old grey school
I would win and you would lose
But you've got everything now
and what a terrible mess I've made of my life
No, I've never had a job
because I've never wanted one
I've seen you smile
but I've never really heard you laugh
So who is rich and who is poor?
I cannot say...
You are your mother's only son
and you're a desperate one
But I don't want a lover
I just want to be seen in the back of your car
A friendship sadly lost?
Well, this is true ...and yet, it's false
Did I ever tell you , by the way
I never did like your face
But you've got everything now
and what a terrible mess I've made of my life
No, I've never had a job
because I'm too shy
But I don't want a lover
I just want to be tied to the back of your car.

 

MISERABLE LIE

So, goodbye
please stay with your own kind
and I'll stay with mine
There's something against us
it's not time
So, goodbye
I know I hardly say
how much I love your casual way
but please put your tongue away
a little higher and we're well away
the dark nights are drawing in
and your humour is as black as them
I look at yours, you laugh at mine
and"love" is just a miserable lie
you have destroyed my flower like-life
not once-but twice
you have corrupt my innocent mind
not once-but twice
I know that wind-swept mystical air
it means: I'd like to see your underwear
I recognise that mystical air
it means: I'd like to see your underwear
what do we get for the trouble and pain?
just a rented room in Whalley Range
into the depths of the criminal world
I followed her...
I need advice, I need advice
because nobody ever looks at me twice
I'm just a country-mile behind
the world
I'm just a country mile behind
the whole world
so take me when you go

 

PRETTY GIRLS MAKE GRAVES

Upon the sand,upon the bay
"there is a quick and easy way" you say
before you illustrate
I'd rather state:
"I'm not the man you think I am
I'm not the man you think I am "
And Sorrow's native son
he will not smile for anyone
And pretty girls makes the graves
End of the pier, end of the bay
you tug my arm and say:"Give into lust,
give up to lust, oh heaven knows we'll
soon be dust..."
But I'm not the man you think I am
I'm not the man you think I am
And Sorrow's native son
he will not rise for anyone
And pretty girls make graves
I could have been wild and I could have been free
but Nature played this trick on me
She wants it Now
and she will not wait
but she's too rough
and I'm too delicate
Then on the sand
another man, he takes her hand
and a smile lights up her stupid face
(and well, it would)
I lost my faith in Womanhood
I lost my faith in Womanhood, I lost my faith

 

THE HAND THAT ROCKS THE CRADLE

Please don't cry
the ghost and the storm outside
will not invade this sacred shire
nor infiltrate your mind
my life down I shall lie
if the bogey-man should try
to play tricks on your sacred mind
to tease, torment and tantalise
wavering shadows loom
a piano plays in an empty room
there'll be blood on the cleaver tonight
when darkness lifts and the room is bright
I'll still be by your side
for you are all that matters
and I'll love you till the day I die
there never need to be longing in your eyes
as long as the hand that rocks the cradle is mine
ceiling shadows shimmy by
and when the wardrobe towers like a beast of prey
there's a sadness in your beautiful eyes
you're untouched, unsoiled, wonderous eyes
my life down I shall lie
should restless spirts try
to play tricks on you sacred mind
but whom I never gave a name
I just looked into his wonderous eyes
and said" never never never again"
all too soon I did return
just like a moth to a flame
so rattle my bones all over the stones
because I'm only a beggar-man whom nobody owns
see how words as old as sin
fit me like a glove I'm here and here I'll stay
together we lie, together we pray
there never need be longing in your eyes
as long as the hand that rocks the cradle is mine

 

STILL ILL

I decree today that life
is simply taking and not giving
England is mine and it owes me a living
ask me why, and I'll spit in your eye
ask me why, and I'll spit in your eye
but we cannot cling to the old dreams anymore
no, we cannot cling to the old dreams anymore
Does the body rule the mind
or does the mind rule the body?
I dunno...
Under the iron bridge we kissed
and although I ended up with sore lips
it just wasn't like the old days anymore
no, it wasn't like those days
am I still ill?
Does the body rule the mind
or does the mind rule the body ?
I dunno...
Ask me why, and I'll die
ask me why, and I'll die
and if you must go to work tomorrow
well, if I were you I wouldn't bother
for there are brighter sides to life
and I should know because I've seen them
but not very often...
under the iron bridge we kissed
and although I ended up with sore lips
it just wasn't like the old days anymore
no, it wasn't like those days
am I still ill?

 

HAND IN GLOVE

Hand in glove
the sun shines out of our behinds
no, it's not like any other love
this one is different-because it's us
Hand in glove
we can go wherever we please
and everything depends upon
how near you stand to me
And if the people stare
then the people stare
I really don't know and I really don't care
Hand in glove
the Good People laugh
yes, we may be hidden by rags
but we have something they'll never have
So, hand in glove I stake my claim
I'll fight to the last breath
If they dare touch a hair on your head
I'll fight to the last breath
The Good Life is out there, somewhere
so stay on my arm, you little charmer
But I know my luck too well
and I'll probably never see you again.

 

WHAT DIFFERENCE DOES IT MAKE?

All men have secrets and here is mine
so let it be known
we have been through hell and high tide,
I can surely rely on you?
and yet you start to recoil,
heavy words are so lightly thrown
but still I'd leap in front of a flying bullet for you
So, what difference does it make?
so, what difference does it make?
it makes none
but you have gone
and you must be looking very old tonight
The devil will find work for idle hands to do
I stole and I lied, and why?
because you asked me to!
but now you make feel so ashamed
because I've only got two hands
well, I'm still fond of you
So, what difference does it make?
so, what difference does it make?
it makes none
but you have gone
and your prejudice won't keep you warm tonight
So, no more apologies
no more apologies
I'm too tired
I'm too sick and tired
and I'm feeling very sick and ill today
But I'm still fond of you

 

I DON'T OWE YOU ANYTHING

Bought on stolen wine
a nod was the first step
you know very well
what was coming next
did I really walk all this way
just to hear you say
"oh I don't want to go out tonight"
but you will
for you must
I don't owe you anything
but you owe me something
repay me now
you should never go to them
let them come to you
just like I do
you should not go to them
let them come to you
just like I do
Too freely on your lips
words prematurely said
oh but I know what will make you smile tonight
Life is never kind
life is never kind
oh but I know what will make you smile tonight

 

SUFFER LITTLE CHILDREN

Over the moors,take me to the moors
dig a shallow grave
and I'll lay me down
Lesley-Anne, with your pretty white beads
oh John, you'll never be a man
and you'll never see your home again
oh Manchester, so much to answer for
Edward, see those alluring lights?
tonight will be your very last night
a woman said "I know my son is dead
I'll never rest my hands on his scared head"
Hindley wakes and Hindley says:
"Wherever he has gone, I have gone "
But fresh lilaced moorland fields
cannot hide the stoild stench of death
Hindley wakes and Hindley says:
"Whatever he has done, I have done"
But this is no easy ride
for a child cries
"find me...find me, nothing more
we're on a sullen misty moor
we may be dead and we may be gone
but we will be right by your side
until the day you die
this is no easy ride
we will haunt you when you laugh
yes, you could say we're a team
you might sleep
BUT YOU WILL NEVER DREAM!"
Oh Manchester, so much to answer for
Oh Manchester, so much to answer for
Over the moor, I'm on the moor
the child is on the moor

 

THE HEADMASTER RITUAL

Belligerent ghouls
run Manchester schools
spineless swines
cemented mines
Sir leads the troops
jealous of youth
same old suit since 1962
he does the military two-step
down the nape of my neck
I wanna go home
I don't want to stay
give up education
is a bad mistake
mid-week on the playing fields
Sir thwacks you on the knees
knees you in the groin
elbow in the face
I wanna go home
I don't want to stay
Belligerent ghouls
run Manchester schools
spineless bastards all
Sir leads the troops
jealous of youth
same old jokes since 1902
he does the military two-step
down the nape of my neck
I wanna go home
I don't want to stay
give up life
as a bad mistake
please excuse me from gym
I've got this terrible cold coming on
he grabs and devours
he kicks me in the showers
kicks me in the showers
and he grabs and devours
I wanna go home
I don't want to stay

 

RUSHOLME RUFFIANS

The last night at the fair
by the big wheel generator
a boy is stabbed
and his money is grabbed
and the air hangs heavy like a dulling wine
she is famous
she is funny
an engagement ring
doesn't mean a thing
to a mind consumed by brass(money)
and though I walk home alone
my faith in love is still devout
the last night at the fair
from a seat on a whirling waltzer
her skirt ascends for a watching eye
it's a hideous trait( on her mother's side)
and though I walk home alone
my faith in love is still devout
then someone falls in love
and someone's beaten up
and the senses being dulled are mine

of a speedway operator
is all a tremulous heart requires
a schoolgirl is denied
she said "How quickly would I die
if I jumped from the top of the parachutes?"

I WANT THE ONE I CAN'T HAVE

On the day that your mentality
catches up with your biology
I want the one I can't have
and it's driving me mad
it's written all over my face
A double-bed
and a stalwart lover, for sure
these are the riches of the poor
A double-bed
and a stalwart lover, for sure
these are the riches of the poor
a tough kid who sometimes swallows nails
raised on Prisoner's Aid
he killed a policeman when he was thirteen
and somehow that really impressed me
it's written all over my face
On the day that your mentality
catches up with your biology
And if you ever need self-validation
just meet me in the alley by the
railway-station
it's written all over my face

 

WHAT SHE SAID

What she said:
"How come someone hasn't noticed
that I'm dead
and decided to bury me
God knows, I'm ready"
What she said was
but then, all the rejection she's had
to pretend to be happy
could only be idiocy
What she said was not for the job or
lover that she never had
What she read
all heady books
she'd sit and prophesise
(it took a tattoed boy from Birkenhead
to really really open her eyes)

THAT JOKE ISN'T FUNNY ANYMORE

Park the car at the side of the road
you should know
time's tide will smother you
and I will too
when you laugh about other people who feel so
very lonely
their only desire is to die
well I'm afraid
it doesn't make me smile
I wish I could laugh
but that joke isn't funny anymore
it's too close to home and it's too near the bone
it's too close to home and it's too near the bone
more than you'll ever know
It was dark as I drove the point home
and on cold leather seats
well, it suddenly struck me
I just might die with a smile on my
face after all
I've seen this happen in other people's lives
and now it's happening in mine

 

NOWHERE FAST

I'd like to drop my trousers to the world
I am a man of means(of slender means)
each household appliance
is like a new science in my town
and if a day came when I felt a natural emotion
I'd get such a shock I'd probably jump in the ocean
and when a train goes by
it's such a sad sound
I'd like to drop my trousers to the Queen
every sensible child will know what this means
the poor and the needy
are selfish and greedy on her terms
and if the day came when I felt a natural emotion
I'd get such a shock I'd probably jump in the ocean
and when a train goes by
it's such a sad song
And when I'm lying in my bed
I think about life
and I think about death
and neither one particularly appeals to me
and if the day came when I felt a natural emotion
I'd get such a shock I'd probably lie
in the middle of the street and die
I'd lie down and die

 

WELL I WONDER

Well I wonder
do you hear me when you sleep?
I hoarsely cry
Well I wonder
do you see me when we pass?
I half-die
Please keep me in mind
please keep me in mind
Gasping-but somehow still alive
this is the fierce last stand of all I am
Gasping-dying-but somehow still alive
this is the final stand of all I am
Please keep me in mind

 

BARBARISM BEGINS AT HOME

Unruly boys
who will not grow up
must be taken in hand
Unruly girls
who will not settle down
they must be taken in hand
A crack on the head
is what you get for not asking
and a crack on the head

MEAT IS MURDER

Heifer whines could be human cries
closer comes the screaming knife
this beautiful creature must die
this beautiful creature must die
a death for no reason
and death for reason is MURDER
and the flesh you so fancifully fry
is not succulent, tasty or nice
it's death for no reason
and death for no reason is MURDER
and the calf that you carve with a smile
is MURDER
and the turkey you festively slice
is MURDER
do you know how animals die?
kitchen aroma aren't very homely
it's not "comforting," "cheery" or kind
it's sizzling blood and the unholy stench
of MURDER
it's not "natural," "normal" or kind
the fleas you so fancifully fry
as you savour the flavour
of MURDER
NO, NO, NO, IT'S MURDER
NO, NO, NO, IT'S MURDER
who hears when animals cry?

 

THE QUEEN IS DEAD

Farewell to this lands cheerless marches
hemmed in like a boar between arches
her very Lowness with her head in a sling
Im truely sorry-but it sounds like a wonderful thing
dear Charles, dont you ever crave
to appear on the front of the Daily mail
dressed in your Mother's bridal veil?
So, I checked all the registered historical facts
and I was shocked into shame to discover
how Im the 18th pale descendent
of some, old queen or other
has the world changed, or have I changed?
has the world changed, or have I changed?
as some 9-year old tough peddles drugs
(I never even knew what drugs were)
And so, I broke into the Palace
with a sponge and a rusty spanner
she said: "Eh, I know you, and you cannot sing"
I said: "that's nothing -you should hear me play piano"
We can go for a walk where it's quiet and dry
and we can talk about precious things
but when you are tied to your mother's apron
not one talks about castration
We can go for a walk where it's quiet and dry
and we can talk about precious things
like love and law and poverty
these are the things that kill me
We can go for a walk where it's quiet and dry
and we can talk about precious things
but the rain that flattens my hair
theses are the things that kill me
Passed the Pub that saps your body
and the church who'll snatch your money
the Queen is dead, boys
and it's so lonely on a limb
Pass the Pub that wrecks your body
and the church-all they want is your money
the Queen is dead, boys`
you can trust me, boys
life is very long, when you're lonely
life is very long, when you're lonely...

 

FRANKLY MR.SHANKLY

Frankly, Mr Shankly, this position Ive held
it pays my way, but it corrodes my soul
I want to leave you will not miss me
I want to go down in musical history
Frankly, Mr Shankly, Im a sickening wreck
Ive got the 21st Century breathing down my neck
I must move fast, you understand me
I want to go down in celluloid history
Fame, Fame, fatal Fame
it can play hideous tricks on the brain
but still I rather be Famous
than righteous or holy, any day
but sometimes Id feel more fulfilled
making Christmas cards with the mentally ill
I want to Live and I want to Love
I want to catch something that I might be ashamed of
Frankly, Mr Shankly, this position I've held
it pays my way and it corrodes my soul
oh, I didnt realise that you wrote poetry
(I didnt realise you wrote such bloody awful poetry)
Frankly, Mr Shankly, since you ask
you are a flatulent pain the arse
I do not mean to be so rude
but still, I must speck frankly, Mr Shankly

 

I KNOW IT'S ALL OVER

Oh Mother, I can fell the soil falling over my head
and as i climb into an empty bed
Oh well, Enough said
I know it's over-still I cling
I don't know where else I can go
Oh Mother, I can feel the soil falling over my head
see, the sea want s to take me
the knife wants to cut me
do you think you can help me?
Sad veiled bride, please be happy
handsome groom, give her room
loud, loutish lover, treat her kindly
(although she needs you
more than she loves you)
and I know it's over
and it never really began
but in my heart it was so real
and you even spoke to me and said:
"If you're so funny
then why are you on your own tonight?
and if you are so clever
then why are you on your own tonight?
if you're so terribly good looking
then why do you sleep alone tonight?
because tonight is just like any other night
that's why you're on your own tonight
with your triumphs and your charms
while they are in each other's arms.."
It's so easy to laugh
it's so easy to hate
it takes strength to be gentle and kind
It's so easy to laugh
it's so easy to hate
it takes guts to be gentle and kind
love is Natural and Real
but not for you, my love
not tonight my love
love is Natural and Real
but not for such as you and I, my love
Oh Mother, I can fell the soil falling over my head
Oh Mother, I can fell the soil falling over my head...

 

NEVER HAD NO ONE EVER

When you walk without ease
on these
the very streets where you were raised
I had a really bad dream
it lasted 20 years, 7 months, and 27 days
Never had no one ever.

 

CEMETERY GATES

A dreaded sunny day
so I meet you at the cemetry gates
Keats and Yeats are on your side
A dreaded sunny day
so I meet you at the cemetry gates
Keats and Yeats are on your side
while Wilde is on mine
So we go inside and we gravely read the stones
all those people all those lives
where are they now ?
with loves, and hates
and passions just like mine
they were born
and then they lived and then they died
which seems so unfair
and I wantr to crv
You say: "ere thrice the sun hath done salutation to the dawn"
and you claim these words as your own
but Im well-read, have heard them said
a hundred times (maybe less, maybe more)
if you must write prose/poems
the words you use should be your own
dont plagiarise or take "on loans"
there's alweays someone, somewhere
with a big nose, who knows
and who trips you up and laughs
when you fall
You say: "ere long done do does did "
words which could only be your own
you then produce the text
from whence was ripped
(some dizzy whore, 1804)
A dreaded sunny day
so let's go where we're happy
so I meet you at the cemetry gates
Keats and Yeats are on your side
A dreaded sunny day
so let's go where we're wanted
so I meet you at the cemetry gates
Keats and Yeats are on your side
but you lose
because Wilde is on mine

 

BIGMOUTH STRIKES AGAIN

Sweetness, sweetness I was only joking
when I said Id like to smash every tooth
in your head
Sweetness, sweetness I was only joking
when I said by right s you should be
bludgeoned in your bed
and now I know how Joan of Arc felt
now I know how Joan of Arc felt
as the flames roseto her roman nose
and her Walkman stared to melt
Bibmouth, bigmouth
bigmouth strikes again
and Ive got no right to take my place
with the Human race
and now I know how Joan of Arc felt
now I know of Joan of Arc felt
as the flames rose to her roman nose

THE BOY WITH A THORN IN HIS SIDE

The boy with the thorn in his side
behind the hatred there lies
a murderous desire for love
how can they look into my eyes
and still they dont believe me
how can they hear me say those words
and still they dont believe me
and if they don't believe me now
will they ever believe me?
and if they don't believe me now
will they ever believe me?
The boy with the thorn in his side
behind the hatred there lies
a plundering desire for love
how can they see the Love in our eyes
and still they don't believe us
and after all this time
they don't want to believe us
and if they dont believe us now
will they ever believe us ?
andd when you want to Live
how do you start ?
where do you go ?
who do you know?

 

VICAR IN A TUTU

I was minding mind business
lifting some lead off
the roof of the Holy Name church
it was worthwhile living a laughable life
just to set my eyes on a blistering sight
of a vicar in a tu-tu
he's not strange
he just wants to live his life this way
a scanty bit of a thing
with a decorative ring
that wouldn't cover the head of a child
as Rose collects the money in the cannister
who comes sliding down the bannister
the vicar in a tu-tu
he's not strange
he just wants to live his life this way
the monkish monsignor
with a head full of plaster
said "my man, get your vile soul dry-cleaned"
as Rose counts the money in the cannister
as natural as rain
he dances again
vicar in a tu-tu
The next day in the pulpit
with Freedom and Ease
combating ignoranca,dust and disease
as Rose counts the money in the cannister
as natural as rain
he dances again
the fabric of a tu-tu
any man could get us to
and I am a living sign.

 

THERE IS A LIGHT THAT NEVER GOES OUT

Take me out tonight
where there's music and there's people
who are young and alive
driving in your car
I never never want to go home
because I havent got one
anymore
take me out tonight
because I want to see people and I
want to see lights
driving in your car
oh please dont drop me home
because it's not my home, it's their
home, and Im welcome no morw
and if a double-decker bus
crashes in to us
to die by your side
such a heavenly way to die
and if a ten ton truck
kills the both of us
to die by your side
the pleasure and the privilege is mine
take me out tonight
oh take me anywhere, I dont care
and in the darken underpass
I thought Oh God, my chance has come at last
(but then a strange fear gripped me and I just couldn't ask)
take me out tonight
take me anywhere, I dont care
just driving in your car
I never never want to go home
because I havent got one
I havent got one.

 

SOME GIRLS ARE BIGGER THAN OTHERS

From the ice-age to the dole-age
there is but one concern
and I have just discover
some girls are bigger than others
some girls are bigger than others
some girls mothers are bigger than
other girls mothers
As Anthony said to Cleopatra
as he opened a crate of ale:
some girls are bigger than others
some girls are bigger than others
some girls mothers are bigger than
other girls mothers.

 

A RUSH AND A PUSH AND AND THE LAND IS OURS

HELLO
I am the ghost of Troubled Joe
hung by his pretty white neck
some eighteen months ago
I travelled to a mystical time zone
but I missed my bed
so I soon came home
they said:
"there's too much caffeine
in your bloodstream
and a lack of real spice
in your life"
I said:
"leave me alone
because I'm alright, dad
just surprised to still
be on my own...."
Ooh, but don't mention love
I'd hate the real strain of the pain again
a rush and a push and the land that
we stand on is ours
it has been before
so it shall be again
and people who are uglier than you and I
they take what they need, and leave
Ooh, but don't mention love
I'd hate the pain and the strain all over again
a rush and a push and the land that
we stand on is ours
it has been before
so why can't it be now?
and people who are weaker than you and I
they take what they want from life
Ooh, but don't mention love
no - just don't mention love!
a rush and a push and the land that
we stand on is ours
your youth may be gone
but you're still a young man
so phone me, phone me, phone me
so phone me, phone me, phone me
Ooh, I think I'm in love...
Urrgh, I think I'm in lerv

 

I STARTED SOMETHING I COULDN'T FINISH

The lanes were silent
with nothing or no one around for miles
I doused our friendly venture
with a hard-faced
three-word gesture
I started something
I forced you into a zone
and you were clearly
never meant to go
hair brushed and parted
typical me, typical me, typical me
I started something
...and now I'm not too sure
I grabbed you by the guilded beams
that's what Tradition means
and I doused another venture
with a gesture
that was...absolutely vile
I started something
forced you to a zone
and you were clearly
never meant to go
hair brushed and parted
typical me, typical me, typical me
I started something
...and now I'm not too sure
I grabbed you by the guilded beams
that's what Tradition means
and now eighteen months' hard-labour
seems...fair enough
I started something

DEATH OF A DISCO DANCER

The death of a disco dancer
well, it happens a lot 'round here
and if you think Peace
is a common goal
well, that goes to show
just how little you know
The death of a disco dancer
well, I'd rather not get involved
I never talk to my neighbour
I'd just rather not get involved
Love, peace and harmony?
Love, peace and harmony?
Oh, very nice, very nice, very nice, very nice
...but maybe in the next world.

 

GIRLFRIEND IN A COMA

Girlfriend in a coma, I know
I know - it's serious
Girlfriend in a coma, I know
I know - it's really serious
there wree times when I could
have 'murdered' her
(but, you know, I would hate
anything to happen to her)
NO, I DON'T WANT TO SEE HER
Do you really think
she'll pull through?
Do you really think
she'll pull through?
Girlfriend in a coma, I know
I know, it's serious
there were time when I could
have 'strangeled' her
(but, you know, I would hate
anything to happen to her)
WOULD YOU PLEASE LET ME SEE HER!
Do you really think she'll pull through?
Do you really think she'll pull through?
Let me wisper my last goodbyes
I know - IT'S SERIOUS

 

STOP ME IF YOU'VE HEARD THIS ONE BEFORE

Stop me, stop me,
stop me if you think that you've heard this one before
stop me, stop me
stop me if you think that you've heard this one before
nothing's changed
I still love you, oh I still love you
...only slightly less than I used to
I was delayed, I was way-laid
an emergency stop
I smelt the last ten seconds of life
I crashed down on the crossbar
and the pain was enough to make
a shy, bald buddhist reflect
and plan a mass-murder
who said I'd lied to her?
who said I'd lied because I never
who said I'd lied because I never
I was detained, I was restrained
he broke my spleen
he broke my knees
(and then he really laid into me)
Friday night in Out-patients
who said I'd lied to her?
who said I'd lied - because I never
who said I'd lied - because I never
Oh, so I drank one
or was it four
and when I fell on the floor
...I drank more
stop me, stop me
stop me if you think that you've heard this one before
nothing's changed
I still love you, I still love you
but only slightly
less than I used to

 

LAST NIGHT I DREAMT THAT SOMEBODY LOVED ME

Last night I dreamt
that somebody loved me
no hope - but no harm
just another false alarm
Las night I felt
real arms around me
no hope - no harm
just another false alarm
so, tell me how long
before the last one?
and tell me how long
before the right one?
this story is old - I KNOW
but it goes on
this story is old - I KNOW
but it goes on

 

UNHAPPY BIRTHDAY

I've come to wish you an unhappy birthday
I've come to wish you an unhappy birthday
because you're evil
and you lie
and if you should die
I may feel slightly sad
(but I won't cry)
Loved and lost
and some may say
when usually its Nothing
surely you're happy
it should be this way?
I say "No, I'm gonna kill my dog"
and: "May the lines sag heavy
and deep tonight XXX"
I've come to wish you an unhappy birthday

Loved and lost

when usually its Nothing

I said "No"
and then I shot myself
so, drink, drink, drink
and be ill tonight
from the one you left behind
from the one you left behind...

 

PAINT A VULGAR PICTURE

At the record company meeting
On their hands - a dead star
and ooh, the plans that they weave
and ooh, the sikening greed
At the record company meeting
on their hands - a dead star
the sycophantic slags all say:
"I knew him first, and I knew him well"
Re-issue! Re-package! Re-package!
Re-evaluate the songs
double-pack with a photograph
Extra Track (and a tacky badge)
A-list, playlist
"Please them, please them!"
"Please them! Please them!"
(sadly, THIS was your life)
but you could have said no
if you'd wanted to
you could have said no
if you'd wanted to
BPI, MTV, BBC
"Please them! Please them!"
(sadly this was your life)
but you could have said no
if you'd wanted to
you could have walked away
...couldn't you?
I touched you at the soundcheck
you had no real way of knowing
in my heart I bgged "please, take
me with you...
I don't care where you're going"
But to you I was faceless
I was fawning, I was boring
just a child from those ugly new houses
who could never begin to know
who could never really know
Best of? Most of?
Satiate the need
slip them into different sleeves!
Buy both, and be decieved
climber - new entry, re-entry
World tour! ("media whore")
"Please the Press in Belgium!"
(THIS was your life...)
and when it fails to recoup?
Well, maybe:
You just haven't earned it yet, baby
I walked a pace behind you at the soundcheck
you're just the same as I am
what makes most people feel happy
leads us headlong into harm
so, in my bedroom in those 'ugly new houses'
I dance my legs down to the knees
but me and my 'true love'
we will never meet again...
At the record company meeting
on their hands - at last! - a dead star!
but they cannot taint you in my eyes
no, they cannout touch you now
No, they cannot hurt you my darling
they cannot touch you now
but me and my 'true love'
will never meet again

 

DEATH AT ONE'S ELBOW

Ooh Glenn, don't come to the house tonight
Ooh, Glenn, don't come to the house tonight
because there's somebody here
who really really loves you
stay home
be bored
(it's crap, I KNOW)
Ooh, Glenn, don't come to the house tonight
Ooh, Glen, don't come to the house tonight
because there's somebody here
who'll take a hatchet to your ear
how the frustration renders me
hateful, Glenn!
don't come to the house tonight
don't come to the house tonight
because you'll slip on the
trail of my bespattered remains
and so, that's why
GOODBYE MY LOVE, GOODBYE MY LOVE, GOODBYE MY LOVE...
Belch

 

I WON'T SHARE YOU

I won't share you
I won't share you
with the drive and ambition
and the zeal I feel
this is my time
as the note I wrote
was read, she said
has the Perrier gone
straight to my head
or is life plainly sick and cruel, instead?
"YES!"
No-no-no-no-no-no
I won't share you
I won't share you
with the drive and the dreams inside
this is my time
Life tends to come and go
well, that's OK
just as long as you know
Life tends to come and go
well, that's OK
just as long as you know
I won't share you
I won't share you
with the drive and the dreams inside
this is my time, this is my time


THE QUEEN IS DEAD

Farewell to this lands cheerless marches
hemmed in like a boar between arches
her very Lowness with her head in a sling
Im truely sorry-but it sounds like a wonderful thing
dear Charles, dont you ever crave
to appear on the front of the Daily mail
dressed in your Mother's bridal veil?
So, I checked all the registered historical facts
and I was shocked into shame to discover
how Im the 18th pale descendent
of some, old queen or other
has the world changed, or have I changed?
has the world changed, or have I changed?
as some 9-year old tough peddles drugs
(I never even knew what drugs were)
And so, I broke into the Palace
with a sponge and a rusty spanner
she said: "Eh, I know you, and you cannot sing"
I said: "that's nothing -you should hear me play piano"
We can go for a walk where it's quiet and dry
and we can talk about precious things
but when you are tied to your mother's apron
not one talks about castration
We can go for a walk where it's quiet and dry
and we can talk about precious things
like love and law and poverty
these are the things that kill me
We can go for a walk where it's quiet and dry
and we can talk about precious things
but the rain that flattens my hair
theses are the things that kill me
Passed the Pub that saps your body
and the church who'll snatch your money
the Queen is dead, boys
and it's so lonely on a limb
Pass the Pub that wrecks your body
and the church-all they want is your money
the Queen is dead, boys`
you can trust me, boys
life is very long, when you're lonely
life is very long, when you're lonely...

 

PANIC

Panic on the streets of London
Panic on the streets of Birmingham
I wonder to myself
Could life ever be sane again
on the Leeds side-streets that you slip down
I wonder to myself
Hopes may rise on the Grasmeres
But Honey Pie, you're not safe here
So you run down
To the safety of the town
But there's Panic on the streets of Carlisle
Dublin, Dundee, Humberside
I wonder to myself
Burn down the Disco
Hang the blessed D.J.
Because the music that they constantly play
IT SAYS NOTHING TO ME ABOUT MY LIFE
Hang the blessed D.J.
Because the music they constantly play
On the Leeds side-streets that you slip down
On the provincial towns that you jog 'round
Hang the D.J.,. Hang the D.J.,.Hang the D.J...

 

VICAR IN A TUTU

I was minding mind business
lifting some lead off
the roof of the Holy Name church
it was worthwhile living a laughable life
just to set my eyes on a blistering sight
of a vicar in a tu-tu
he's not strange
he just wants to live his life this way
a scanty bit of a thing
with a decorative ring
that wouldn't cover the head of a child
as Rose collects the money in the cannister
who comes sliding down the bannister
the vicar in a tu-tu
he's not strange
he just wants to live his life this way
the monkish monsignor
with a head full of plaster
said "my man, get your vile soul dry-cleaned"
as Rose counts the money in the cannister
as natural as rain
he dances again
vicar in a tu-tu
The next day in the pulpit
with Freedom and Ease
combating ignoranca,dust and disease
as Rose counts the money in the cannister
as natural as rain
he dances again
the fabric of a tu-tu
any man could get us to
and I am a living sign.

 

ASK

Shyness is nice, but
Shyness can stop you
From doing all the things in life
That you'd like to
So, if there's something you'd like to try
ASK ME-I WON'T SAY "NO"-HOW COULD I?
Coyness is nice, but ,
Coyness can stop you
from saying all the things in
life that you want to
If there's something that you'd like to try
ASK ME-I WON'TSAY"NO"-HOW COULD I?
Spending warm, Summer days indoors
Writing fringhtening verse
To a buck-toothed girl in Luxembourg
ASK ME, ASK ME ,ASK ME, ASK ME, ASK ME ,ASK ME
Because if it's not Love
Then it's the Bomb
That will bring us together
Nature is a language-can't you read?
Nature is a language-can't you read?
ASK ME, ASK ME ,ASK ME, ASK ME, ASK ME ,ASK ME
Because if it's not Love
Then it's the Bomb
That will bring us together

 

MARIE'S THE NAME (HIS LATEST FLAME) / RUSHOLME RUFFIANS

Very old friend 
Came by today 
As he was telling everyone in town 
Of all the love that he'd just found 
And Marie's the name (of his latest flame) 
Talked and talked 
And I heard him say 
That she had the longest blackest hair 
Prettiest green eyes anywhere 
And Marie's the name (of his latest flame) 
The last night of the fair 
By the big wheel generator 
A boy is stabbed 
His money is grabbed 
And the air hangs heavy like a dulling wine 
She is Famous 
She is Funny 
An engagement ring 
Doesn't mean a thing 
To a mind consumed by brass (money), oh 
The last night of the fair 
From a seat on a whirling waltzer 
Her skirt ascends for a watching eye 
It's a hideous trait (on her mother's side)
From a seat on a whirling waltzer 
Her skirt ascends for a watching eye 
A hideous trait (on her mother's side) 
Then someone falls in love 
Someone's beaten up 
Someone's beaten up 
And the senses being dulled are mine 
And someone falls in love 
Someone's beaten up 
And the senses being dulled are mine 
This is the last night of the fair 
And the grease in the hair 
Of a speedway operator 
Is all a tremulous heart requires 
A schoolgirl is denied 
She said : "How quickly would I die 
If I jumped from the top of the parachutes ?"
This is the last night of the fair 
And the grease in the hair 
Of a speedway operator 
Is all a tremulous heart requires 
A schoolgirl is denied 
She said : "How quickly would I die 
Oh, if I jumped from the top of the parachutes ?"
...Oh, walk home alone 
I might walk home alone 
But my faith in love is still devout

 

THE BOY WITH THE THORN IN HIS SIDE

The boy with the thorn in his side
behind the hatred there lies
a murderous desire for love
how can they look into my eyes
and still they dont believe me
how can they hear me say those words
and still they dont believe me
and if they don't believe me now
will they ever believe me?
and if they don't believe me now
will they ever believe me?
The boy with the thorn in his side
behind the hatred there lies
a plundering desire for love
how can they see the Love in our eyes
and still they don't believe us
and after all this time
they don't want to believe us
and if they dont believe us now
will they ever believe us ?
andd when you want to Live
how do you start ?
where do you go ?
who do you know?

 

RUBBER RING / WHAT SHE SAID

Yeah! What she says : 
"How come someone hasn't noticed 
That I'm dead 
And decided to bury me ? 
God knows, I'm ready !"
La-la-la ... 
What she said was sad 
But then, all the rejection she's had 
To pretend to be happy 
Could only be idiocy 
La-la-la ... 
What she said was not for the job or 
Lover that she never had 
No no no ... 
What she read 
All heady books 
She'd sit and prophesise 
(It took a tattooed boy from 
Birkenhead 
To really really open her eyes)

No no no no ...

 

IS IT REALLY SO STRANGE?

I left the North 
I travelled South 
I found a tiny house 
And I can't help the way I feel 
Oh yes, you can kick me 
And you can punch me 
And you can break my face 
But you won't change the way I feel 
'Cause I love you, Oh ... 
And is it really so strange ? 
Oh, is it really so strange ? 
Oh, is it really so, really so strange ? 
I say NO, you say YES 
(and you will change your mind) 
I left the South 
I travelled North 
I got confused - I killed a horse 
I can't help the way I feel 
Oh yes, you can punch me 
And you can butt me 
And you can break my spine 
But you won't change the way I feel 
'Cause I love you, Oh ... 
And is it really so strange ? 
Oh, is it really so strange ? 
Oh, is it really so, really so strange ? 
I say NO, you say YES 
(But you will change your mind) 
I left the North again 
I travelled South again 
And I got confused - I killed a nun 
I CAN'T HELP THE WAY I FEEL 
(I lost my bag in Newport Pagnell) 
Why is the last mile the hardest mile ? 
My throat was dry, with the sun in my eyes 
And I realised, I realised 
I could never 
I could never, never, never, go back home again

 

CEMETERY GATES

A dreaded sunny day
so I meet you at the cemetry gates
Keats and Yeats are on your side
A dreaded sunny day
so I meet you at the cemetry gates
Keats and Yeats are on your side
while Wilde is on mine
So we go inside and we gravely read the stones
all those people all those lives
where are they now ?
with loves, and hates
and passions just like mine
they were born
and then they lived and then they died
which seems so unfair
and I wantr to crv
You say: "ere thrice the sun hath done salutation to the dawn"
and you claim these words as your own
but Im well-read, have heard them said
a hundred times (maybe less, maybe more)
if you must write prose/poems
the words you use should be your own
dont plagiarise or take "on loans"
there's alweays someone, somewhere
with a big nose, who knows
and who trips you up and laughs
when you fall
You say: "ere long done do does did "
words which could only be your own
you then produce the text
from whence was ripped
(some dizzy whore, 1804)
A dreaded sunny day
so let's go where we're happy
so I meet you at the cemetry gates
Keats and Yeats are on your side
A dreaded sunny day
so let's go where we're wanted
so I meet you at the cemetry gates
Keats and Yeats are on your side
but you lose
because Wilde is on mine

 

LONDON

Smoke
Lingers 'round your fingers
Train
Heave on - to Euston
Do you think you've made
The right decision this time?
You left
Your tired family grieving
And you think they're sad because you're leaving
But didn't you see the Jealousy in the eyes
Of the ones who had to stay behind?
And do you think you've made
The right decision thins time?
You left
Your girlfriend on the platform
With thei really ragged notion that you'll return
But she knows
That when he goes
He really goes
So do you think you've made
The right decision this time?

 

I KNOW IT'S OVER

I can feel the soil falling over my head 
And as I climb into an empty bed 
Oh well. Enough said. 
I know it's over - still I cling 
I don't know where else I can go 
Over ... 
Oh Mother, I can feel the soil falling over my head 
See, the sea wants to take me 
The knife wants to cut me 
Do you think you can help me ? 
Sad veiled bride, please be happy 
Handsome groom, give her room 
Loud, loutish lover, treat her kindly 
(Though she needs you 
More than she loves you) 
And I know it's over - still I cling 
I don't know where else I can go 
Over, it's over, it's over, it's over 
It's over, la ... 
I know it's over 
And it never really began 
But in my heart it was so real
And you even spoke to me, and said : 
"If you're so funny 
Then why are you on your own tonight ? 
And if you're so clever 
Then why are you on your own tonight ? 
I know ... 
'Cause tonight - it's just like any other night 
That's why you're on your own tonight 
Your triumphs and your charms 
While they're in each other's arms..."
It's so easy to laugh 
It's so easy to hate 
It takes strength to be gentle and kind 
Over, over, over, over 
It's so easy to laugh 
It's so easy to hate 
It takes guts to be gentle and kind 
Over, over 
Love is Natural and Real 
But not for you, my love 
Not tonight, my love 
Love is Natural and Real 
But not for such as you and I, my love 
Oh Mother, I can feel the soil falling over my head...
Oh Mother, I can feel the soil fall over, fall over my head 
Oh Mother, I can feel the ... fall over my ... , Oh ...

 

THE DRAIZE TRAIN

A vastly superior version of the instrumental B-side, acting as a peace 
offering to Marr (Morrissey chose the tracks for the compilation, 
and of course, receives no royalties on this track).

 

STILL ILL

I decree today that life
is simply taking and not giving
England is mine and it owes me a living
ask me why, and I'll spit in your eye
ask me why, and I'll spit in your eye
but we cannot cling to the old dreams anymore
no, we cannot cling to the old dreams anymore
Does the body rule the mind
or does the mind rule the body?
I dunno...
Under the iron bridge we kissed
and although I ended up with sore lips
it just wasn't like the old days anymore
no, it wasn't like those days
am I still ill?
Does the body rule the mind
or does the mind rule the body ?
I dunno...
Ask me why, and I'll die
ask me why, and I'll die
and if you must go to work tomorrow
well, if I were you I wouldn't bother
for there are brighter sides to life
and I should know because I've seen them
but not very often...
under the iron bridge we kissed
and although I ended up with sore lips
it just wasn't like the old days anymore
no, it wasn't like those days
am I still ill?

 

BIGMOUTH STRIKES AGAIN

Sweetness, sweetness I was only joking
when I said Id like to smash every tooth
in your head
Sweetness, sweetness I was only joking
when I said by right s you should be
bludgeoned in your bed
and now I know how Joan of Arc felt
now I know how Joan of Arc felt
as the flames roseto her roman nose
and her Walkman stared to melt
Bibmouth, bigmouth
bigmouth strikes again
and Ive got no right to take my place
with the Human race
and now I know how Joan of Arc felt
now I know of Joan of Arc felt
as the flames rose to her roman nose
and her hearing aid started to melt
Bigmouth, bigmouth
bigmouth strikes again
and Ive got no right to take my place
with the Human race

 
ALSATIAN COUSTIN

Were you and he Lovers?
and would you say so if you were?
on a forecourt
on a Friday
passing my way
Were you and he Lovers?
and if you were, then say that you were!
on a groundsheet
under canvas
with your tent-flap
open wide
A note upon his desk:
"P.S. Bring Me Home And Have Me!"
Leather elbows on a tweed coat
- Oh! -
Is THAT the best you can do?
So came his reply:
"...but on the desk is where I want you!"
So I ask (even though I know):
were you and he Lovers?

 

LITTLE MAN, WHAT NOW?

An afternoon nostalgia
television show
you spoke in silhouette
(but they couldn't name you)
although the panel were
very polite to you
but I remembered you
from Friday nights 1969
ATV - you murdered every line
too old to be a child star
too young to take leads
four seasons passed
and they AXED you
nervously juvenile
(WON'T SMILE!)
What became of you?
did that swift eclipse torture you?
a star at eighteen
and then-suddenly gone
down to a few lines
in the back page of a teenage annual
oh but I remembered you
I looked up to you

 

EVERYDAY IS LIKE SUNDAY

Trudging slowly over wet sand
back to the bench
where your clothes were stolen
this is the coastal town
that they forgot to close down
Armageddon - come Armageddon!
Come Armageddon! Come!
Everyday is like Sunday
everyday is silent and grey
Hide on the promenade
scratch out a postcard
"how I dearly with I was not here"
in the seaside town
...that they forgot to bomb
Come! Come! Come - nuclear bomb!
Everyday is like Sunday
everyday is silent and grey
Trudging back over pebbles and sand
and a strange dust lands on your hands
(and on your face)
Everyday is like Sunday
"Win Yourself A Cheap Tray"
share some greased tea with me
everyday is silent and grey

 

BENGALI IN PLATFORMS

No no no
he does not want to depress you
oh no no no no no
he only wants to impress you
Bengali in platform
she only wants to embrace your culture
and to be your friend forever
Bengali, Bengali
oh shelve your Western plans
and understand that life is hard enough when you belong here
A silver-studded rim that glistens
and an ankle-star that...blinds me
a lemon sole so very high
which only reminds me, to tell you
so I break the news gently
I break the news to you gently
"Shelve your plans"
Bengali, Bengali
its the touchy march of time
that blinds you
don't blame me
don't hate me
just because I'm the one to tell you
that life is hard enough when you belong here
life is hard enough when you belong here
shelve your western plans
life is hard enough when you belong here

 

ANGEL, ANGEL, DOWN WE GO TOGETHER

Angel, Angel
don't take your life tonight
I know they take
and that they take in turn
and they give you nothing real
for yourself in return
and when they've used you
and they've broken you
and wasted all your money
and cast your shell aside
and when they've bought you
and they've sold you
and they've billed you for the pleasure
and they've made your parents cry
I will be here
BELIEVE ME
I will be here
...believe me
Angel, don't take your life
some people have got no pride
they do not understand
the Urgency of life
but I love you more than life
I love you more than life
I love you more than life
I love you more than life

 

LALE NIGHT, MAUDLIN STREET

The last night on Maudlin Street
goodbye house
goodbye stairs
I was born here
I was raised here, and
...I took some stick here
love at first sight
may sound trite
but it's true, you know
I could list the details
of everything you ever wore
or said, or how you stood that day
and as we spend the last night
on Maudlin Street, I say
"goodbye house-forever!"
I never stole a happy hour
around here
Where the world's ugliest boy
became what you see
here I am - the ugliest man
Its the last night on Maudlin Street
and truly I do love you
oh, truly I do love you
When I sleep with that picture of
you framed beside my bed
oh, it's childish and it's silly
but I think it's you in my room
by the bed (...yes, I told you it was silly...)
and I know
I took strange pills
but I never meant to hurt you
oh truly I love you
I came home late one night
everyone had gone to bed
nobody stays up for you
when you have sixteen stitches
all around your head
the last buss I missed to Maudlin Street
so, he drove me home in the Van
complaining: "Women only like me for my mind..."
don't leave your torch behind
power-cuts ahead
as we crept through the park
but no I cannot steal a pair of jeans
off a clothesline for you
but you...without clothes
oh I could not keep a straight face
me - without clothes?
well a nation turns its back and gags...
I'm packed
I am moving house
a half-life disappears today
every slag waves me on
(secretly wishing me gone
well, I will be soon
oh - I will be soon)
There were bad times on Maudlin Street
when they took you away in a police car
dear Inspector - don't you know?
don't you care?
don't you know - about Love?
Your gran died
and your mother died
on Maudlin Street
in pain and ashamed
with never time to say
those special things
I took the keys from Maudlin Street
well, it's only bricks and mortar!
and...truly I do love you
wherever you are
wherever you are

 

SUEDHEAD

Why do you come here
why do you hang around
I'm so sorry
I'm so sorry
Why do you come here
when you know it makes
things hard for me
when you know, oh
why do you come?
Why do you telephone?
and why send me silly notes?
I'm so sorry
I'm so sorry
why do you come here
when you know it makes
thing hard for me
when you know, oh
why do you come?
You had to sneak into my room
'just' to read my diary
was it just to see all the things
you knew I'd written about you?
and...so many illustrations
I'm so very sickened
oh, I am so sickened NOW

 

BREAK UP THE FAMILY

The strange logic of your clumsiest line
stayed emblazoned on my mind
break up the family
and lets begin to live our lives
I went to see all my friends tonight
it wasn't Youth, it wasn't even Life
born Old, sadly wise
resigned (well, we were)
to ending our lives
I'm so glad to grow older
to move away from those awful times
I want to see all my friends tonight
Yes you found love but you weren't
at peace with your life
home late, full of Hate
despise the ties that bind
oh I'm so glad to grow older
to move away from those younger years
now I'm in love for the first time
and I don't feel bad
Let me see all my old friends
let me put my arm around them
because I really do love them
now, does that sound mad?
Captain of games, solid framed
I stood on the touchline
hailstones, driven home
in his car - no breaks? I don't mind
I'm just so glad to grow older
to move away from those darker years
I'm in love for the first time
and I don't feel bad
so wish me luck my friends
goodbye

 

HAIRDRESSER ON FIRE

Here is London
here is London
is it home of the free,
or what?
can you squeeze me
into an empty page of your diary
and psychologically save me
I've got faith in you
I sense the power
in the fingers
within an hour the power
can totally destroy me
or it could same my life
here is London
'home of the brash, outrageous
and free'
you are repressed
but you're remarkably dressed
is it Real?
but you're far to busy
busy scissors
busy clippers
hair dresser on fire
all around Sloane Square
and you're far too busy
to see me
"busy,busy"
hairdresser on fire
was a client over-cautious
he made you nervous
and when he said
"I'm gonna sue you"
I really felt for you
so can you squeeze me
into an empty page of your diary
and supernaturally change me
CHANGE ME, CHANGE ME

 

THE ORDINARY BOYS

Ordinary boys, happy knowing nothing
happy being no one, but themselves
Ordinary girls, supermarket clothes
who think it's very clever to be cruel to you
for you were so different
you stood all alone
and you knew
that it had to be so
avoiding ordinary boys
happy going nowhere, just around here
in their rattling cars
and ordinary girls
never seeing further
than the cold, small streets
that trap them
but you were so different
you had to say no
when those empty fools
tried to change you, and claim you
for the lair of their ordinary world
where they feel so lucky
so lucky, so lucky
with their lives laid out before them
they're so lucky, so lucky
so lucky, so lucky

 

I DON'T MIND IF YOU FORGET ME

I don't mind
I don't mind if you forget me
having learned my lesson
I never left an impression on anyone
so now you send me your hardened 'regards'
when once you'd send me 'love'
sincerely I must tell you
your mild 'best wishes'
they make me suspicious
but I don't mind
I don't mind if you forget me
having learned my lesson
I never left
an impression on anyone
the pressure to change, to move on
was strange
and very strong
so this is why I tell you
I really do understand
BYE BYE
I don't mind if you forget me
no no no no no no no
REJECTION IS ONE THING
BUT REJECTION FROM A FOOL
IS CRUEL
REJECTION IS ONE THING
BUT REJECTION FROM A FOOL
IS CRUEL
and I don't mind if you forget me
I don't mind if your forget me

 

DIAL-A-CLICHE

Further into the fog I fall
well, I was just
following you!
when you said:
"Do as I do and scrap your fey ways"
(dial-a-cliche)
"grow up, be a man, and close your mealy-mouth!"
(dial-a-cliche)
But the person underneath
where does he go?
does he slide by the wayside?
or...does he just die?
when you find that you've organized
your feelings, for people
who didn't like you then
and certainly don't like you now
yet still you say:
"Do as I do and scrap your fey ways"
(dial-a-cliche)
"grow up, be a man, and close your mealy-mouth!"
(dial-a-cliche)
"the Safe way is the only way!
there's always time to change, son!"
yes well I've changed
but I'm in pain!
dial-a-chiche

 

MARGARET ON THE GUILLOTINE

The kind people
have a wonderful dream
Margaret on the guillotine
because people like you
make me feel so tired
when will you die?
when will you die?
when will you die?
when will you die?
when will you die?
because people like you
make me feel so old inside
please die
and kind people
do not shelter this dream
make it real
make the dream real
make the dream real
make it real

 

OUR FRANK

Our frank and open
deep conversations
they get me nowhere
they bring me down, so
give it a rest, won't you?
give me a cigarette
God give me patience
just no more conversation
Give us a drink
and make it quick
or else I'm gonna be sick
sick all over
your frankly vulgar
red pullover
now see how the colours blend
Our frank and open
deep conversations
they get me nowhere
they bring me down, so
give it a rest, won't you?
now will you just give over
the world may be ending
but look, I'm only human
Give us a drink
and make it quick
or else I'm gonna be sick
all over
your frankly vulgar
red pullover
now see how the two colours blend
Won't somebody stop me
from thinking all the time
about everything
so deeply
so bleakly

 

ASIAN RUT

Day oh so late
strangely the sun still shone
oh Asian boy
what are you on?
Day oh so late
strangely the sun still shone
what drugs are you on?
Tooled-up Asian boy
has come here to avenge
the cruel, cold killing
of his very best friend
Tooled-up Asian boy
has come here to take revenge
for the cruel, cold killing
of his only friend
Peace through the school
so quiet in the hall
it's a strange sign for one
of what's to come
Tough and hard and pale
oh they may just impale you on railings
oh English boys
it must be wrong
three against one?
Brakes slammed, and
a gun jammed, and
as far as I could tell
brave Asian boy
dealt a blow and fell
I'm just passing through here
on my way to somewhere civilised
and maybe I'll even arrive
maybe I'll even arrive?

 

SING YOUR LIFE

Sing your life
any fool can think of words that rhyme
many others do
why don't you?
do you want to?
Sing your life
just walk right up to the microphone
and name
all the things that you love
all the things that you loathe
sing your life
all the things that you love
all the things that you loathe
oh sing your life
oh sing your life
Others sang your life
but now's your chance to shine
and have the pleasure of
saying what you mean
the rare pleasure of
meaning what you sing
oh, make no mistake, my friend
all of this will end
so sing it now
all the things you love
all the things you loathe
oh sing your life
all the things that you love
all the things that you loathe
oh sing your, oh sing your
Don't leave it all unsaid
somewhere in the wasteland of your head
and make no mistake, my friend
your pointless life will end
but before you go
can you look at the truth?
You have a lovely singing voice
a lovely singing voice
and all of those
who sing on key
they stole the notion
from you and me

 

MUTE WITNESS

Your poor witness
crying so loudly on the floor
oh but she's only trying to tell you
what it was that she saw
she is only trying to tell you
what it was that she saw
Now see her standing on the table
with her small arms flailing
and you feel such compassion
in your soul for
Your poor mute witness
still testing the strength
of our patience
oh but she's only trying to tell you
what it was that she saw
Now see her pointing to the frisbee
with a memory too fuzzy
as her silent words
describe the fright of last night
4 a.m. Norhtside, Clapham Common
who knows what she was doing there?
will she sketch the answer later?
Well, I'll ask her
"now dry your tears, my dear"
Now see her mime in time so nicely
it would all have been so clear
is only she had never volunteered
"your taxi is here, my dear"

 

KING LEER

Your boyfriend, he
went down on one knee
well, could it be
he's only got one knee?
I tried to surprise you
with Vodka
or, Tizer
I can't quite remember
but you didn't thank me
you didn't even thank me
because you never do
Your boyfriend, he
has the gift of the gab
or, could it be
the gift of the grab?
I tried to surprise you
I lay down beside you
and...nothing much happened
and you didn't phone me
you didn't even phone me
because it's not your style
to dial
Your boyfriend, he
displays to me
more than just
a hint of cruelty
I tried to surprise you
I crept up behind you
with a homeless chihuahua
you gushed for an hour
you handed him back and said
"You'll never guess
I'm bored now"

 

FOUND FOUND FOUND

found found found found found found
someone who's worth it
in this murkiness
someone who's never
seeming scheming
found found found found found found
someone who's worth it
in this murkiness
someone who's never
seeming scheming
Oh, but if I'd never found
oh, but if I'd never found
oh, but if I'd never found
I do believe that
the more you give your love
and I do believe that
the more you offer trust
the more you chase
the more you cry
the more you're bound to lose
the more you're bound to lose
Oh, but if I'd never found
oh, but if I'd never found
somebody
who wants to be
who wants to be
with me
all the time

 

DRIVING YOUR GIRLFRIEND HOME

I'm driving
your girlfriend home
and she's saying
how she never chose you
"turn left", she says
so I turn left
and she says
"So how did I end up
so deeply involved in
the very existence
I planned on avoiding?"
and I can't answer
I'm driving
your girlfriend home
and she's laughing
to stop herself crying
"drive on", she says
so I drive on
and she says
"So how did I end up
attached to this person
when his sense of humour
gets gradually worser?"
and I can't tell her
I'm parking
outside her home
and we're shaking hands
goodnight, so politely

 

THE HARSH TRUTH OF THE CAMERA EYE

Churchillian legs
hair barely there
the harsh truth of the camera eye
Your eyes signal pain
because of the strain
of smiling
the harsh truth of the camera eye
telling you all
that you never wnated to know
showing what
you didn't want shown
My so friendly lens
zooms into
"the inner you"
and it tells the harsh truth
and nothing but
Laugh with us all here
that's if you can
then take the pictures home
and screamtelling you all
that you never wanted to know
showing you what
you didn't want shown
This photographer
he must have really had it in for you
"Oh, I don't want
to be judged anymore
I don't wnat to be judged
I would sooner be Loved
I would sooner be
just blindly Loved..."

 

(I'M) THE END OF THE FAMILY LINE

With no complications
fifteen generations
(of mine)
all honouring Nature
until I arrive
(with incredible style)
I'm the end fo the line
the end of the family line
the end of the line
No baby pulled screaming
out into this seething whirl
by chance or whim
(or even love?)
our family tree hacked into decline
and I'm spared the pain
of ever saying
("goodbye")
I'm the end of the line
the end of the family line
the end of the line

 

THERE'S A PLACE IN HELL FOR ME AND MY FRIENDS

There is a place
reserved
for me and my friends
and when we go
we all will go
so you see
I'm never alone
there is a place
with a bit more time
and a few more
gentler words
and looking back
we do forgive
(we had no choice
we always did)
all that we hope
is that when we go
our skin
and our blood
and our bones
don't get in your way
making you ill
the way they did
when we lived
There is a place
a place in hell
reserved
for me and my friends
and if ever I
wanted to cry
then I will
because I can

 

TONY THE PONY

Still drinking on the corner 
Just don't say I didn't warn you 
Always nagging big brother 
He's only looking out for you 
Tony The Pony 
Tony The Pony 
You're still standing on the corner 
Just don't say I didn't warn you 
Old and jealous big brother 
You had your time and you spent it 
Crying 
Now, Tony The Pony 
Tony The Pony 
So, that's what they call you now ? 
When you're free outside 
So cold and hard and in control 
And ... 
There's a free ride on 
Tony The Pony 
Oh, why do you always wanna stop me 
From doing the things in life that make me happy ? 
And when I'm outside with friends, laughing loudly 
Why do you always wanna stop me ? 
Oh, I would never 
I would never 
But you will carry the can for anyone 
The free ride on 
Gullible Tony 
You're drunker quicker 
And you're sicker even quicker 
For something heavy is gonna fall on you 
Oh ... 
And what do they call you now ? 
When you're free outside 
So cold and hard and in control 
And, oh ... been a lark 
There's a free ride on 
Fucked-up Tony 
I will never say I told you so 
Or how I knew that something bad 
Would happen to you 
I don't wanna say I told you so 
Oh, but Tony, I told you so !!! 
I told you so

 

YOU'RE GONNA NEED SOMEONE ON YOUR SIDE

With the world's fate 
Resting on your shoulder 
You're gonna need 
Someone on your side 
You can't do it by yourself 
Any longer 
You're gonna need 
Someone on your side 
Someone kindly told me 
That you'd wasted 
Eight of nine lives
Oh, give yourself a break 
Before you break down 
You're gonna need someone on your side 
And here I am, And here I am 
Well, you don't need 
To look so pleased ! 
Day or night, 
There is no difference 
You're gonna need someone on your side 
Day or night, 
There is no difference 
You're gonna need someone soon 
And here I am, And here I am 
Well, you don't need 
To look so pleased

 

GLAMOROUS GLUE

First day with the jar 
You find 
Everyone lies 
First day with the jar 
You find 
Everyone lies, nobody minds 
Everyone lies 
Where is the man you respect ? 
And where is the woman you love ? 
Where's the woman you love ? 
Third week with the jar
You find 
Everything dies 
We won't vote Conservative 
Because we never have 
Everyone lies, everyone lies 
Where is the man you respect ? 
And where is the woman you love ? 
Where's the woman you love ? 
Everything of worth 
On Earth Is there To share 
I used to dream, and I used to vow 
I wouldn't dream of it now 
We look to Los Angeles 
For the language we use 
London is dead, London is dead, London is dead...
Now I'm too much in love 
I'm too much in love 
I know 
I'll go 
Empty hand 
From the land

 

WE'LL LET YOU KNOW

How sad are we ? 
And how sad have we been ? 
We'll let you know 
We'll let you know 
Oh, but only if - you're really interested 
You wonder how 
We've stayed alive 'till now 
We'll let you know 
We'll let you know 
But only if - you're really interested 
We're all smiles 
Then, honest, I swear, it's the turnstiles 
That make us hostile 
Oh ... 
We will descend 
On anyone unable to defend 
Themselves 
Oh ... 
And the songs we sing 
They're not supposed to mean a thing 
La, la, la, la ... 
Oh ...You're lonely, Oh ... you're lonely, Oh ... 
GET OFF THE ROOF ! Oh ... 
Your Arsenal !
We may seem cold, or 
We may even be 
The most depressing people you've ever known 
At heart, what's left, we sadly know 
That we are the last truly British people you'll ever know 
We are the last truly British people you will ever know 
You'll never never want to know

 

THE NATIONAL FRONT DISCO

David, the wind blows 
The wind blows ... 
Bits of your life away 
Your friends all say ... 
"Where is our boy ? Oh, we've lost our boy" 
But they should know 
Where you've gone 
Because again and again you've explained that 
You're going to ... 
Oh, you're going to ... 
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah 
England for the English ! 
England for the English ! 
David, the winds blow 
The winds blow ...
All of my dreams away 
And I still say : 
"Where is our boy ? Ah, we've lost our boy" 
But I should know 
Why you've gone 
Because again and again you've explained
You've gone to the ... 
National, ah ... 
To the National .. 
There's a country; you don't live there 
But one day you would like to 
And if you show them what you're made of 
Oh, then you might do ... 
But David, we wonder 
We wonder if the thunder 
Is ever really gonna begin 
Begin, begin 
Your mom says : 
"I've lost my boy" 
But she should know 
Why you've gone 
Because again and again you've explained 
You've gone to the : 
National 
To the National 
To the National Front Disco 
Because you want the day to come sooner 
You want the day to come sooner 
You want the day to come sooner 
When you've settled the score 
Oh, the National 
Oh, the National

 

CERTAIN PEOPLE I KNOW

I take the cue from 
Certain people I know 
I use the cue 
And then I 
Hand it on to you 
And when I swing it 
So, it catches his eye ... 
(Weren't you there ? 
- You'd have died !) 
I trust the views of 
Certain people I know 
They look at Danger 
And they 
LAUGH THEIR HEADS OFF 
Their clothes are Imitation 
George the 23rd 
(Don't you find this absurd ?) 
I'd hate to be like 
Certain people I know 
They break their necks 
And can't afford to
Get them fixed 
Ah, they'd sacrifice all 
Of their principles for 
anything cashable 
I do believe it's terrible 
Oh, wo, wo, Ah, ah, ah, ah, Oh, wo, wo...

 

WE HATE IT WHEN OUR FRIENDS BECOME SUCCESSFUL

We hate it when our friends become successful 
We hate it when our friends become successful 
Oh, look at those clothes 
Now look at that face, it's so old 
And such a video ! 
Well, it's really laughable 
Ha, ha, ha ...
We hate it when our friends become successful 
And if they're Northern, that makes it even worse
And if we can destroy them 
You bet your life we will 
Destroy them 
If we can hurt them 
Well, we may as well ... 
It's really laughable 
Ha, ha, ha ... 
You see, it should've been me 
It could've been me 
Everybody knows 
Everybody says so 
They say : 
"Ah, you have loads of songs 
So many songs 
More songs than they'd stand 
Verse 
Chorus 
Middle eight 
Break, fade 
Just listen ..."
La, la-la, la-la

 

YOU'RE THE ONE FOR ME, FATTY

You're the One for me, fatty 
You're the One I really, really love 
And I will stay 
Promise you'll say 
If I'm in your way
You're the One for me, fatty 
You're the One I really, really love 
And I will stay 
Promise you'll say 
If I'm ever in your ...
A-hey 
All over Battersea 
Some hope; and some despair 
All over Battersea 
Some hope; and some despair 
Oh ... You're the One for me, fatty 
You're the One I really, really love 
And I will stay 
Promise you'll say 
If I'm in your way
You're the One for me, fatty 
You're the One I really, really love 
And I will stay 
Promise you'll say 
If I'm ever in your ...
A-hey 
All over Battersea 
Some hope; and some despair 
All over Battersea 
Some hope; and some despair 
Oh, oh ... You're the One for me, fatty 
You're the One I really, really love 
And I will stay 
Promise you'll say 
If I'm ever in your way
A-hey 
You're the One for me, fatty 
You're the One for me, a-hey-hey 
A-hey A-hey A-hey A-he-he-he-hey

 

SEASICK, YET STILL DOCKED

I am a poor freezingly cold soul 
So far from where 
I intended to go 
Scavenging through life's very constant lulls 
So far from where I'm determined to go 
Wish I knew the way to reach the one I love
There is no way ... 
Wish I had the charm to attract the one I love 
But you see, I've got no charm 
Mmm...
Tonight I've consumed much more than I can hold 
Oh, this is very clear to you 
And you can tell I have never really loved 
You can tell, by the way, I sleep all day
And all of my life no-one gave me anything 
No-one has ever given me anything 
My love is as sharp as a needle in your eye 
You must be such a fool 
To pass me by

 

I KNOW IT'S GONNA HAPPEN SOMEDAY

My love, wherever you are 
Whatever you are 
Don't lose faith 
I know it's gonna happen someday 
To you 
Please wait ... Please wait ... Oh ... Wait ... 
Don't lose faith 
You say that the day just never arrives 
And it's never seemed so far away 
Still, I know it's gonna happen someday 
To you 
Please wait ... 
Don't lose faith

 

TOMORROW

Tomorrow 
Will it really come ? 
And if it does come 
Will I still be Human ? 
All I ask of you is one thing that you never do 
Would you put your arms around me ? 
(I won't tell anyone) 
Tomorrow 
Does it have to come ?
All I ask of you is one thing that you'll never do 
Would you put your arms around me ? 
(I won't tell anybody) 
Tomorrow 
And what must come before ...
Oh, the pain in my arms 
Oh, the pain in my legs 
Ooh, my shiftless body 
Tomorrow 
It's surely nearer now ? 
You don't think I'll make it 
I never said I wanted to ! 
Well did I ? 
Oh, the pain in my arms 
Oh, the pain in my legs 
Oh, yeah; oh, yeah, No, yeah; no, yeah 
Through my shiftless body 
Tomorrow, Tomorrow 
All I ask of you ... oh ... 
Is : would you tell me that you love me 
Tell me, tell me that you love me, Tell me, tell me that you love me ... 
Ah, I know you don't mean it 
Ah, I know you don't mean it 
Tell me, tell me that you love me, Tell me, tell me that you love me ...

 

YOU'RE THE ONE FOR ME, FATTY

You're the One for me, fatty 
You're the One I really, really love 
And I will stay 
Promise you'll say 
If I'm in your way
You're the One for me, fatty 
You're the One I really, really love 
And I will stay 
Promise you'll say 
If I'm ever in your ... A-hey 
All over Battersea 
Some hope; and some despair

CERTAIN PEOPLE I KNOW

I take the cue from 
Certain people I know 
I use the cue And then I 
Hand it on to you 
And when I swing it 
So, it catches his eye ... 
(Weren't you there ? 
- You'd have died !) 
I trust the views of 
Certain people I know 
They look at Danger 
And they 
LAUGH THEIR HEADS OFF 
Their clothes are Imitation 
George the 23rd 
(Don't you find this absurd ?) 
I'd hate to be like 
Certain people I know 
They break their necks 
And can't afford to
Get them fixed 
Ah, they'd sacrifice all 
Of their principles for 
anything cashable 
I do believe it's terrible 
Oh, wo, wo Ah, ah, ah, ah Oh, wo, wo...

 

THE NATIONAL FRONT DISCO

David, the wind blows 
The wind blows ... 
Bits of your life away 
Your friends all say ... 
"Where is our boy ? Oh, we've lost our boy" 
But they should know 
Where you've gone 
Because again and again you've explained that 
You're going to ... 
Oh, you're going to ... 
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah 
England for the English ! 
England for the English ! 
David, the winds blow 
The winds blow ...
All of my dreams away 
And I still say : 
"Where is our boy ? Ah, we've lost our boy" 
But I should know 
Why you've gone 
Because again and again you've explained
You've gone to the ... 
National, ah ... To the National .. 
There's a country; you don't live there 
But one day you would like to 
And if you show them what you're made of 
Oh, then you might do ... 
But David, we wonder 
We wonder if the thunder 
Is ever really gonna begin 
Begin, begin 
Your mom says : 
"I've lost my boy" 
But she should know 
Why you've gone 
Because again and again you've explained 
You've gone to the : 
National, To the National 
To the National Front Disco 
Because you want the day to come sooner 
You want the day to come sooner 
You want the day to come sooner 
When you've settled the score 
Oh, the National, Oh, the National…

 

NOVEMBER SPAWNED A MONSTER

Sleep on and dream of Love
because it's the closest you will get to love
poor twisted child, so ugly, so ugly
poor twisted child, oh hug me, oh hug me
one November spawned a monster 
in the shape of this child who later cried
"But Jesus made me, so Jesus save me from
pity, sympathy and people discussing me"
a frame of useless limbs what can make GOOD
all the BAD that's been done?
And if the lights were out
could you even bear
to kiss her full on the mouth (or anywhere?)
poor twisted child, so ugly, so ugly
poor twisted child, oh hug me, oh hug me
one November spawned a monster 
in the shape of this child who must remain
a hostage to kindess and the wheels underneath her
a hostage to kindess and the wheels underneath her
a symbol of where mad, mad lovers
must PAUSE and draw the line
So sleep and dream of love
because it's the closest
you will get to love
that November is a time which I must put OUT of my mind
oh one fine day 
LET IT BE SOON
she won't be rich or beautiful
but she'll be walking your streets
in the clothes that she went out
and chose for herself

 

SEASICK, YET STILL DOCKED

I am a poor freezingly cold soul 
So far from where 
I intended to go 
Scavenging through life's very constant lulls 
So far from where I'm determined to go 
Wish I knew the way to reach the one I love
There is no way ... 
Wish I had the charm to attract the one I love 
But you see, I've got no charm 
Mmm...
Tonight I've consumed much more than I can hold 
Oh, this is very clear to you 
And you can tell I have never really loved 
You can tell, by the way, I sleep all day
And all of my life no-one gave me anything 
No-one has ever given me anything 
My love is as sharp as a needle in your eye 
You must be such a fool 
To pass me by

 

THE LOOP

I just wanna say 
I haven't been away 
I'm still right here 
Where I always was 
So one day, if you're bored 
By all means call 
Because you can do 
(But only if you want to) 
I just wanna say 
I haven't been away 
I am still right here 
Where I always was 
So one day, when you're bored 
By all means call 
Because you can do 
But you might not get through

 

SISTER I'M A POET

All over this town 
Yes, a low wind may blow 
And I can see through everybo... 
With no reason 
To hide these words I feel 
And no reason 
To talk about the books I read 
But still I do 
That's 'cause I'm a ... Sister I'm a ... 
All over this town 
Along this way 
Outside the prison gates 
I love the romance of crime 
And I wonder 
Does anybody feel the way I do ? 
And is evil just something you are 
Or something you do ? 
Sister I'm a ... Sister I'm a ... 
All over this town, All over this town 
They pull over 
In their Citroen vans 
Not to shake your hand 
With meths on their breaths 
And you with youth on your side 
A plastic bag stranded at the lights 
This once was me ...
But now I'm a ... Sister I'm a ...
All over this town ... Oh, oh, oh 
All over this town, All over this town, Oh ... 
I still cannot speak French ... I am very lazy

 

JACK THE RIPPER

Oh, you look so tired 
Mouth slack and wide 
Ill-housed and ill-advised 
Your face is as mean 
As your life has been 
Crash into my arms 
I WANT YOU 
You don't agree -
But you don't refuse 
I know you 
And I know a place 
Where no one is likely to pass 
Oh, you don't care if it's late 
And you don't care if you're lost 
And oh, you look so tired 
(But tonight you presumed too much) 
Too much, too much 
And if it's the last 
Thing I ever do 
I'M GONNA GET YOU 
Crash into my arms 
I WANT YOU 
You don't agree -
But you don't refuse 
I know you 
And no one knows a thing about my life 
I can come and go as I please 
And if I want to, I can stay 
Oh, or if I want to, I can leave 
Nobody knows me, Nobody knows me, Nobody knows me Oh, oh...

 

SUCH A LITTLE THING MAKES SUCH A BIG DIFFERENCE

Such a little thing, such a little thing
but the difference it made was grave
there you go
wielding a bicycle chain
oh why won't you change
cange and be nicer?
such a little thing
a gentle tone of kindness
or written words on paper
- can you write?
How I love all of
the very simple things of life
(God's good air)
how I love all of
the very simple things of life
such a little thing
a fumbling politeness
the difference it saved me
wielding a bicycle chain
"I WILL NOT CHANGE AND I WILL NOT BE NICE"
Most people keep their brains between your legs (don't you find?)
Leave me alone - I was only singing, leave me alone because
I was only singing
leave me alone - I was only singing, leave me alone
you have just proved (again)
MOST PEOPLE KEEP THEIR BRAINS BETWEEN THEIR LEGS

 

I KNOW IT'S GONNA HAPPEN SOMEDAY

My love, wherever you are 
Whatever you are 
Don't lose faith 
I know it's gonna happen someday 
To you 
Please wait ... 
Please wait ... 
Oh ... Wait ... 
Don't lose faith 
You say that the day just never arrives 
And it's never seemed so far away 
Still, I know it's gonna happen someday 
To you 
Please wait ... 
Don't lose faith

 

WE'LL LET YOU KNOW

How sad are we ? 
And how sad have we been ? 
We'll let you know, We'll let you know 
Oh, but only if - you're really interested 
You wonder how 
We've stayed alive 'till now 
We'll let you know, We'll let you know 
But only if - you're really interested 
We're all smiles 
Then, honest, I swear, it's the turnstiles 
That make us hostile 
Oh ... We will descend 
On anyone unable to defend 
Themselves 
Oh ... And the songs we sing 
They're not supposed to mean a thing 
La, la, la, la ... Oh ...
You're lonely, Oh ... you're lonely 
Oh ... 
GET OFF THE ROOF !
Oh ... Your Arsenal !
We may seem cold, or 
We may even be 
The most depressing people you've ever known 
At heart, what's left, we sadly know 
That we are the last truly British people you'll ever know 
We are the last truly British people you will ever know 
You'll never never want to know

 

SUEDHEAD

Why do you come here
why do you hang around
I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry
Why do you come here
when you know it makes
things hard for me
when you know, oh
why do you come?
Why do you telephone?
and why send me silly notes?
I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry
why do you come here
when you know it makes
thing hard for me
when you know, oh
why do you come?
You had to sneak into my room
'just' to read my diary
was it just to see all the things
you knew I'd written about you?
and...so many illustrations
I'm so very sickened
oh, I am so sickened NOW

 

HE KNOWS I'D LOVE TO SEE HIM

He Knows (he knows)
Or, I think he does
because when I lived
in the Arse of the world...
he knows, he knows, he knows I'd love
to see him happy (or as close as is allowed)
because when I lived
in the Arse of the world
he knows, he knows, he knows I'd love
to see him happy (or as close as possible
as close as possible, as close as is allowed)
My name still conjours up deadly deeds
and a bad taste in the mouth
the police - they actually knew me
they said:
"You're just another person in the world
you're just another fool with radical views
you're just another who has maddening views
you want to turn it on its head
by staying in bed!"
I said: "I know I do"

 

YOU'RE GONNA NEED SOMEONE ON YOUR SIDE

With the world's fate 
Resting on your shoulder 
You're gonna need 
Someone on your side 
You can't do it by yourself 
Any longer 
You're gonna need 
Someone on your side 
Someone kindly told me 
That you'd wasted 
Eight of nine lives
Oh, give yourself a break 
Before you break down 
You're gonna need someone on your side 
And here I am, And here I am 
Well, you don't need 
To look so pleased ! 
Day or night, 
There is no difference 
You're gonna need someone on your side 
Day or night, 
There is no difference 
You're gonna need someone soon 
And here I am, And here I am 
Well, you don't need 
To look so pleased

 

GLAMOROUS GLUE

First day with the jar 
You find 
Everyone lies 
First day with the jar 
You find 
Everyone lies, nobody minds, Everyone lies 
Where is the man you respect ? 
And where is the woman you love ? 
Where's the woman you love ? 
Third week with the jar
You find 
Everything dies 
We won't vote Conservative 
Because we never have 
Everyone lies, everyone lies 
Where is the man you respect ? 
And where is the woman you love ? 
Where's the woman you love ? 
Everything of worth 
On Earth, Is there, To share 
I used to dream, and I used to vow 
I wouldn't dream of it now 
We look to Los Angeles 
For the language we use 
London is dead, London is dead, London is dead, ...
Now I'm too much in love 
I'm too much in love, 
I know I'll go 
Empty hand 
From the land

 

WE HATE IT WHEN OUR FRIENDS BECOME SUCCESSFUL

We hate it when our friends become successful 
We hate it when our friends become successful 
Oh, look at those clothes 
Now look at that face, it's so old 
And such a video ! 
Well, it's really laughable 
Ha, ha, ha ...
We hate it when our friends become successful 
And if they're Northern, that makes it even worse
And if we can destroy them 
You bet your life we will 
Destroy them 
If we can hurt them 
Well, we may as well ... 
It's really laughable 
Ha, ha, ha ... 
You see, it should've been me 
It could've been me 
Everybody knows 
Everybody says so 
They say : 
"Ah, you have loads of songs 
So many songs 
More songs than they'd stand 
Verse 
Chorus 
Middle eight 
Break, fade 
Just listen ..."
La, la-la, la-la

 

NOW MY HEART IS FULL

There's gonna be some trouble 
A whole house will need re-building 
And everyone I love in the house 
Will recline on an analyst's couch quite 
Soon 
Your Father cracks a joke 
And in the usual way 
Empties the room 
Tell all of my friends 
(I don't have too many 
Just some rain-coated lovers' puny brothers)
Dallow, Spicer, Pinkie, Cubitt 
Rush to danger 
Wind up nowhere 
Patric Doonan - raised to wait 
I'm tired again, I've tried again, and 
Now my heart is full 
Now my heart is full 
And I just can't explain 
So I won't even try to
Dallow, Spicer, Pinkie, Cubitt 
Every jammy Stressford poet 
Loafing oafs in all-night chemists 
Loafing oafs in all-night chemists 
Underact - express depression 
Ah, but Bunnie I loved you 
I was tired again 
I've tried again, and 
Now my heart is full 
Now my heart is full 
And I just can't explain 
So I won't even try to 
Could you pass by ? 
Could you pass by ? 
Oh ... 
Now my heart is full 
Now my heart is full 
And I just can't explain 
So ... slow ... 
Slow ... slow ... slow ... slow ... slow ...

 

SPRING-HEELED JIM

Spring-heeled Jim winks an eye 
He'll "do", he'll never be "done to" 
He takes on whoever flew through 
"Well, it's the normal thing to do" ... ah ... 
Spring-heeled Jim lives to love 
Now kissing with his mouth full 
And his eyes on some other fool 
So many women 
His head should be spinning 
Ah, but no ! 
Ah, but no ! 
But no !
Ah, no !
Spring-heeled Jim slurs the words : 
"There's no need to be so knowing
Take life at five times the 
Average speed, like I do" 
Until Jim feels the chill 
"Oh, where did all the time go ?" 
Once always in for the kill 
Now it's too cold 
And he feels too 
old 
Too old
Mmm, old... 
La, la, la, la-la, la ...

 

BILLY BUDD

Say, Billy Budd 
So you think you should ? 
Oh, everyone's laughing 
Say, Billy Budd 
So you think that you should ? 
Everyone's laughing ! 
Since I took up with you 
Things have been bad 
Yeah, but now it's 12 years on 
Now it's 12 years on 
Yes, and I took up with you 
I took my job application 
Into town 
Did you hear ? They turned me down 
Yes, and it's all because of us 
Oh, and what was in our eyes 
Oh, what was in our eyes, yeah 
I said, Billy Budd 
I would happily lose 
Both of my legs 
I would lose both of my legs 
Oh, if it meant you could be free 
Oh, if it meant you could be free 
(Don't leave us in the dark!)

 

HOLD ON TO YOUR FRIENDS

A bond of trust 
Has been abused 
Something of value 
May be lost 
Give up your job 
Squander your cash - be rash 
Just hold on to your friends 
There are more than enough 
To fight and oppose 
Why waste good time 
Fighting the people you like 
Who will fall defending your name 
Oh, don't feel so ashamed 
To have friends 
But now you only call me 
When you're feeling depressed 
When you feel happy I'm 
So far from your mind 
My patience is stretched 
My loyalty vexed 
Oh, you're losing all of your friends 
Hold on to your friends 
Hold on to your friends 
Resist - or move on 
Be mad, be rash 
Smoke and explode 
Sell all of your clothes 
Just bear in mind : 
Oh, there just might come a time 
When you need some friends

 

THE MORE YOU IGNORE ME, THE CLOSER I GET

The more you ignore me 
The closer I get 
You're wasting your time 
The more you ignore me 
The closer I get 
You're wasting your time 
I will be 
In the bar 
With my head 
On the bar 
I am now 
A central part 
Of your mind's landscape 
Whether you care 
Or do not 
Yeah, I've made up your mind 
The more you ignore me 
The closer I get 
You're wasting your time 
The more you ignore me 
The closer I get 
You're wasting your time 
Beware !
I bear more grudges 
Than lonely high court judges 
When you sleep 
I will creep 
Into your thoughts 
Like a bad debt 
That you can't pay 
Take the easy way 
And give in 
Yeah, and let me in 
Oh, let me in 
Oh let me ... 
Oh, let me in 
IT'S WAR 
IT'S WAR 
WAR 
WAR 
Oh, let me in 
Ah, the closer I get 
Ah, you're asking for it 
Ah, the closer I get 
Ooh, the closer I ...

 

WHY DON'T YOU FIND OUT FOR YOURSELF

The sanest days are mad 
Why don't you find out for yourself ? 
Then you'll see the price 
Very closely 
Some men here 
They have a special interest 
In your career 
They wanna help you to grow 
And then syphon all your dough 
Why don't you find out for yourself ? 
Then you'll see the glass 
Hidden in the grass 
You'll never believe me, so 
Why don't you find out for yourself ? 
Sick down to my heart 
That's just the way it goes 
Some men here 
They know the full extent of 
Your distress 
They kneel and pray 
And they say : 
"Long may it last" 
Why don't you find out for yourself ?
Then you'll see the glass 
Hidden in the grass 
Bad scenes come and go 
For which you must allow 
Sick down to my heart 
That's just the way it goes 
Don't rake up my mistakes 
I know exactly what they are 
And ... what do YOU do ? 
Well ... you just SIT THERE 
I've been stabbed in the back 
So many many times 
I don't have any skin 
But that's just the way it goes

 

I AM HATED FOR LOVING

I am hated for loving 
I am hated for loving 
Anonymous call, a poison pen 
A brick in the small of the back again 
I still don't belong 
To anyone - I am mine 
And I am hated for loving 
I am haunted for wanting 
Anonymous call, a poison pen 
A brick in the ... ah ... 
A brick in the small of the back again 
I still don't belong 
To anyone - I am mine 
I am falling 
With no-one to catch me 
I am falling 
And there's still 
No-one to catch me 
Ah .. 
Anonymous call, a poison pen 
A brick in the ... ah ... 
A brick in the small of the back again 
I just don't belong 
To anywhere 
I just don't belong 
Mmm ... 
Ah ...

 

LIFEGUARD SLEEPING, GIRL DROWNING

Always looking for attention 
Always needs to be mentioned 
Who does she 
Think she should be ? 
The shrill cry through darkening air 
Doesn't she know he's 
Had such a busy day ? 
Tell her ... sshhh
Somebody tell her ... sshhh 
Slowest ... 
It was only a test 
But she swam too far 
Against the tide 
She deserves all she gets 
The sky became marked with stars 
As an out-stretched arm slowly 
Disappears 
Hooray 
Oh hooray 
No, oh, oh, woh, there's no movement 
No, oh, hooray 
Oh, hooray 
Please don't worry 
There'll be no fuss 
She was ... nobody's nothing 
(What's your name ?) 
When he awoke 
The sea was calm 
And another day passes like a dream 
There's no ... no way 
(What's your name ?)

 

USED TO BE A SWEET BOY

Used to be a sweet boy 
Holding so tightly 
To Daddy's hand 
But that was all 
In some distant land 
Blazer and tie 
And a big bright healthy smile 
Used to make all 
Of our trials worthwhile 
Used to be a sweet boy 
And I'm not to blame 
Something went wrong 
And I know 
I'm not to blame 
Something went wrong 
Can't be to blame 
Ah ...

 

THE LAZY SUNBATHERS

A world war 
Was announced 
Days ago 
But they didn't know 
The lazy sunbathers 
The lazy sunbathers 
The sun burns through 
To the planet's core 
And it isn't enough 
They want more 
Nothing 
Appears 
To be 
Between the ears of 
The lazy sunbathers 
Too jaded 
To question stagnation 
The sun burns through 
To the planet's core 
And it isn't enough 
They want more 
Religions fall 
Children shelled 
"...Children shelled ? That's all 
Very well, but would you 
Please keep the noise 
Down low ? 
Because you're waking 
The lazy sunbathers ..."
Oh, the lazy sunbathers 
The lazy sunbathers

 

SPEEDWAY

And when you slam 
Down the hammer 
Can you see it in your heart ? 
All of the rumours 
Keeping me grounded 
I never said, I never said that they were 
Completely unfounded 
So when you slam 
Down the hammer 
Can you see it in your heart ? 
Can you delve so low ? 
And when you're standing 
On my fingers 
Can you see it in your heart ? ... ah ... 
And when you try 
To break my spirit 
It won't work 
Because there's nothing left to break 
Anymore 
All of the rumours 
Keeping me grounded 
I never said, I never said that they were 
Completely unfounded 
You won't sleep 
Until the earth that wants me 
Finally has me 
Oh you've done it now 
You won't rest 
Until the hearse that becomes me 
Finally takes me 
Oh you've done it now 
And you won't smile 
Until my loving mouth 
Is shut good and proper 
FOREVER 
All of the rumours 
Keeping me grounded 
I never said, I never said that they were 
Completely unfounded 
And all those lies 
Written lies, twisted lies 
Well, they weren't lies 
They weren't lies 
They weren't lies 
I never said 
I never said 
I could have mentioned your name 
I could have dragged you in 
Guilt by implication 
By association 
I've always been true to you 
In my own strange way 
I've always been true to you 
In my own sick way 
I'll always stay true to you

 

THE TEACHERS ARE AFRAID OF THE PUPILS

There's too many people 
Planning your downfall 
When your spirit's on trial 
These nights can be frightening 
Sleep transports sadness 
To some other mid-brain 
And somebody here 
Will not be here next year 
So you stand by the board 
Full of fear and intention 
And, if you think that they're listening 
Well, you've got to be joking 
Oh, you understand change 
And you think it's essential 
But when your profession 
Is humiliation 
Say the wrong word to our children ...
We'll have you, oh yes, we'll have you 
Lay a hand on our children 
And it's never too late to have you 
Mucus on your collar 
A nail up through the staff chair 
A blade in your soap 
And you cry into your pillow 
To be finished would be a relief 
To be finished would be a relief... 
Say the wrong word to our children ...
We'll have you, oh yes, we'll have you 
Lay a hand on our children 
And it's never too late to have you 
To be finished would be a relief 
To be finished would be a relief...
I'm very glad this thing has come 
Sometimes I'm so glad 
Never bother to play the tunes 
I've seen it coming for dear life

 

READER MEET AUTHOR

You don't know a thing about their lives 
They live where you wouldn't dare to drive
You shake as you think of how they sleep 
But you write as if you are my side-by-side 
Reader, meet Author 
With the hope of hearing sense 
But you may be feeling let down 
By the words of defence 
He says : "No-one ever sees me when I cry"
You don't know a thing about their lives 
Books don't save them, books aren't Stanley knives 
And if a fight broke out here tonight 
You'd be the first away, because you're that type 
And the Year 2000 won't change anyone here 
As each fabled promise flies so fast 
You'll swear it was never there 
Oh, have you ever escaped from a shipwrecked life ? 
So safely with your software; all miles from the front line 
You hear the way their sad voices, and you start to imagine things 
Oh, any excuse to write more lies

 

THE BOY RACER

He's just too good-natured and 
He's got too much money and 
He's got too many girlfriends 
I'm jealous, that's all 
Have you seen him go, though, oh ? 
Have you seen him go, though, oh ? 
Boy racer, Boy racer, oh 
We're gonna kill this pretty thing 
Boy racer, Boy racer, oh 
We're gonna kill this pretty thing 
He's got many girlfriends 
He thinks he owns this city 
He overspeeds and he never gets pulled over 
Have you seen him go, though, oh ? 
Have you seen him go, though, oh ? 
Boy racer, Boy racer, oh 
We're gonna kill this pretty thing 
Boy racer, Boy racer, oh 
We're gonna kill this pretty thing 
He thinks he got the whole world in his hands 
Stood at the urinal 
He thinks he got the whole world in his hands 
And I'm gonna ... kill him !
Oh, no ! Oh, no ! Oh, no ! Oh, no ! Oh, no !Oh .... 
Boy racer Boy racer, oh 
We're gonna kill this pretty thing...
He's just too good-looking, and, And, and ... 
Boy racer Boy racer, oh 
We're gonna kill this pretty thing...

 

THE OPERATION

You fight with your right hand 
And caress with your left hand 
Everyone I know is sick to death of you 
With a tear that's a mile wide 
In the kite that you're flying 
Everyone I know is sick to death of you 
Ever since 
You don't look the same 
You're just not the same, no way 
You say clever things and 
You never used to 
You don't catch what I'm saying 
When you're deafened to advice 
Everyone here is sick to the 
Back teeth of you 
With a tear that's a mile wide 
In the kite that you're flying 
Everyone here is sick to the 
Tattoo of you 
Ever since 
You don't look the same 
You're just not the same, no way 
You say pleasant things and 
There is no need to
Still, you fight with your right hand 
And caress with your left hand 
Ooh, ooh ... Sad to say ... 
How once I was in love with you 
Sad to say ... 
You don't catch what I'm saying 
When you're deafened to advice 
Ooh, ooh ... Ever since 
You don't look the same 
You're just not the same, no way 
What the hell have 
They stuck into you ?

 

DAGENHAM DAVE

Head in the clouds, and a mouthful of pie 
Head in a blouse, everybody loves him 
I see why 
Dagenham Dave, Dagenham Dave, Oh, Dagenham Dave 
Dagenham Dave, Dagenham Dave, Oh, Dagenham Dave 
"I love Karen, I love Sharon" on the windowscreen 
With never the need to fight or to question a single thing 
Dagenham Dave, Dagenham Dave Oh, Dagenham Dave 
Dagenham Dave, Dagenham Dave Oh, Dagenham Dave ...
He'd love to touch, he's afraid that he might self-combust 
I could say more, but you get the general idea 
Dagenham Dave, Dagenham Dave Dagenham Dave, Dagenham Dave 
Dagenham, Dagenham Dagenham Dave, Dagenham Dave ...
Oh, Dave, oh, Dagenham, dagenham, Oh, Dave, oh, Dave, ...

 

DO YOUR BEST AND DON'T WORRY

Compare the best of their days 
With the worst of your days 
You won't win 
With your standards so high 
And your spirits so low 
At least remember ... 
This is you on a bad day, you on a pale day 
Just do your best and don't ... Don't worry, oh 
The way you hang yourself is oh, so unfair 
See the best of how they look 
Against the worst of how you are
And again, you won't win 
With your standards so high 
And your spirits so low 
At least remember ... 
This is you on a drab day, you in a drab dress 
Just do your best and don't ... Don't worry, oh 
The way you hang yourself is oh, so unfair 
Just do your best and don't ... Don't worry, oh 
The way you watch yourself is oh, so unfair 
Just do your best and don't ... Don't worry, oh 
Do your best and don't ...

SOUTHPAW

You were a boy before you became a man 
I don't see the joy 
And you ran with your pals in the sun 
You turned around and they were gone 
Again ... 
A sick boy should be treated 
So easily defeated 
Oh, I just don't understand 
So you ran with your pals in the sun 
You turned around 
You were alone 
Again ... 
And you ran back to Ma 
Which set the pace for the rest of your days 
Oh, you ran back to Ma 
Which set the pace for the rest of your days 
Oh, you ran back to Ma 
Which set the pace for the rest of your days 
And now, there is something that you should know 
There is something that you should know 
The girl of your dreams is 
Here all alone 
Girl of your dreams is 
Here all alone 
The girl of your dreams is 
Sad and all alone 
The girl of your dreams is 
Here all alone 
There is something that you should know 
There is something that you should know 
Girl of your dreams is 
Here all alone 
The girl of your dreams is 
Sad and is all alone 
The girl of your dreams is 
Sad and is feeling all alone 
Oh, there is something that you should know 
Help me, help me, help me ...

 

MALADJUSTED

I wanna start from 
Before the beginning 
Loot wine, "Be mine, and 
Then let's stay out for the night"
Ride via Parkside 
Semi-perilous lives 
Jeer the lights in the windows 
Of all safe and stable homes 
(But wondering then, well what 
Could peace of mind be like ?)
Anyway do you want to hear 
Our story, or not ? 
As the Fulham Road lights 
Stretch and invite into the night 
From a Stevenage overspill 
We'd kill to live around 
SW6 - with someone like you 
Keep thieves' hours 
With someone like you 
...As long as it slides 
You stalk the house 
In a low-cut blouse : 
"Oh Christ, another stifled 
Friday night !"
And the Fulham Road lights 
Stretch and invite into the night 
Well, I was fifteen 
What could I know ?
When the gulf between 
All the things I need 
And the things I receive 
Is an ancient ocean 
Wide, wild, lost, uncrossed 
Still I maintain there's nothing 
Wrong with you 
You do all that you do 
Because it's all you can do 
Well, I was fifteen 
Where could I go ?
With a soul full of loathing 
For stinging bureaucracy 
Making it anything 
Other than easy 
For working girls like me 
With my hands on my head 
I flop on your bed 
With a head full of dread 
For all I've ever said 
Maladjusted, maladjusted 
Maladjusted maladjusted 
Never to be trusted 
Oh, never to be trusted 
There's nothing wrong with you, oh 
...There's nothing wrong with you

 

ALMA MATTERS

So : the choice I have made 
May seem strange to you 
But who asked you, anyway ? 
It's my life to wreck 
My own way 
You see : to someone, somewhere, oh yeah ... 
Alma matters 
In mind, body and soul 
In part, and in whole 
Because to someone, somewhere, oh yeah ... 
Alma matters 
In mind, body and soul 
In part, and in whole 
So the life I have made 
May seem wrong to you 
But, I've never been surer 
It's my life to ruin 
My own way 
You see : to someone, somewhere, oh yeah ... 
Alma matters 
In mind, body and soul 
In part, and in whole 
Because to someone, somewhere, oh yeah ... 
Alma matters 
In mind, body and soul 
In part, and in whole 
To someone, somewhere, oh yeah ... 
Alma matters 
In mind, body and soul 
Part, and in whole 
So to someone, somewhere, oh yeah ... 
Alma matters 
In mind, body and soul 
Part, and in whole 
To someone, somewhere, oh yeah ... 
Oh yeah ... Oh yeah, oh yeah Oh yeah ...

 

AMBITIOUS OUTSIDERS

Bolt-lock your doors 
Alarm your cars 
And still we move in closer 
Every day 
Top of the list 
Is your smiling kids 
But we'll be smiling too 
So that's OK 
Oh, and by the way 
Thank you, because you're 
Giving, giving, giving 
And we're receiving - 
No, no, we're taking 
Keeping the population down 
Your taxes paid, but 
Police waylaid 
And we knows 
When the school bus 
Comes and goes 
We're on your street, but 
You don't see us 
Or, if you do 
You smile and say Hello 
BUT DON'T UNDERESTIMATE US 
When you are 
Giving, giving, giving 
And we're receiving - 
No, no, we're taking 
Just keeping 
The population down 
You're giving, giving, giving 
Well, it's your own fault 
For reproducing 
We're just keeping 
The population down

 

TROUBLE LOVES ME

Trouble loves me 
Trouble needs me 
Two things 
More than you do 
Or would attempt to 
So, console me 
Otherwise, hold me 
Just when it seems like 
Everything's evened out 
And the balance 
Seems serene 
Trouble loves me 
Walks beside me 
To chide me 
Not to guide me 
It's still much more 
Than you'll do 
So, console me 
Otherwise, hold me 
Just when it seems like 
Everything's evened out 
And the balance seems serene 
See the fool I'll be 
Still running 'round 
On the flesh rampage 
Still running 'round 
Ready with ready-wit 
Still running 'round 
On the flesh rampage 
- At your age ! 
Go to Soho, oh 
Go to waste in 
The wrong arms 
Still running 'round 
Trouble loves me 
Seeks and finds me 
To charlatanize me 
Which is only 
As it should be 
Oh, please fulfill me 
Otherwise, kill me 
Show me a barrel and watch me scrape it 
Faced with the music, as always I'll face it 
In the half-light 
So English, frowning 
Then at midnight I 
Can't get you out of my head 
A disenchanted taste 
Still running 'round 
A disenchanted taste 
Still running 'round

 

PAPA JACK

Papa Jack 
Wants to turn 
Back the clock 
And reach out 
To the kids 
He once had 
Who have flown 
Papa Jack 
In decline 
Feels inclined 
To reach out 
To the kids 
He once had 
Who have flown 
But there was a time 
When the kids reached up 
And Papa Jack just 
Pushed them away 
Looking deep 
In his heart 
Papa Jack 
Doesn't like 
What he sees 
Or the time 
On his hands 
The dying day 
The chilly sun 
Papa Jack 
All alone 
Sings slow 
Grieving and low 
But there was a time 
When the kids reached up 
Now you can't always 
Have it your way 
Papa Jack 
Ah ...

 

AMMUNITION

I know these roads 
Each ridge 
And narrow bridge 
Each cheveron 
Enticing me on 
Each warning sign 
I take in my stride 
I don't need more ammunition 
I've got more than I can spend 
I don't dwell on things I'm missing 
I'm just pleased 
With the things I've found 
I know these roads 
An old hand understands 
Above all, I know what's 
Expected of me now 
Veering cliffwards 
I don't need more ammunition 
I've got more than I can spend 
I don't dwell on things I'm missing 
I'm just pleased 
With the things I've found 
With the things I've found 
With the things I've found 
I've found 
I've been crying 
It comes back on these salient days 
And it stays 
And it says : 
"We've never really been away" 
I don't need more ammunition 
I've got more than I can spend 
I don't think of who I'm missing 
I've got no space and no time 
In my life, anymore 
No space or time 
In my life, anymore 
For Revenge

 

WIDE TO RECEIVE

Download something 
Useful, or useless 
Because I'm lying here 
Wide to receive 
Almost anything 
You'd care to give 
And I don't 
Get along with myself 
And I'm not too keen 
On anyone else 
Turn on, plug in 
Then just walk away 
Unlock, process 
And then just go 
And I've never felt quite so alone 
As I do right now 
I'm lying here 
Wide to receive 
Almost anything 
You'd care to leave 
Wide, wide, wide Wide, wide, wide...

 

ROY'S KEEN

(GO ON !)
He's romancing you 
And chancing his arm 
He'll be here 
Smiling on time 
He's romancing you 
And chancing his arm 
He'll be here 
Smiling on time 
Roy's keen oh Roy's keen 
Roy's keen oh Roy's keen 
We've never seen a 
Keener window-cleaner 
Back up the ladder 
Into each corner 
Dunking the chamois 
Just think of the goodwill 
The ladder's a planet 
Roy is a star, and 
I am a satellite 
(But that's alright) 
He can hold a smile for as long 
As you require (even longer) 
He can hold a smile for as long 
As you require (even longer) 
Roy's keen oh Roy's keen 
Roy's keen oh Roy's keen 
We've never seen a 
Keener window-cleaner 
Back up the ladder 
Into each corner 
Dunking the chamois 
Just think of the goodwill 
The ladder's a planet 
Roy is a star, and 
I am a satellite 
I will be set alight 
Don't say you'll hold it steady 
Then you let it go 
Don't say you'll hold it steady 
Then you let it go Oh ...
You're up the ladder 
Into each corner 
Foot in a bucket 
We trust you to wreck it 
Even when it's under your nose 
Well, you just can't 
See it, can you ? 
Well, it's here 
Right under your nose 
And you just can't 
See it, can you? La la la la ...
Roy's keen, Roy's keen La la la la ...
We've never seen a 
Keener window-cleaner 
Oh ... La la la la ...

 

HE CRIED

I need you 
Simple words 
But words which had never been heard 
By the soul 
Stoned to death 
But still living 
And so he froze where he stood 
And he looked to the ground 
And he cried 
He cried 
Ride our minds 
If you must 
But there's always a line you don't cross 
Time is short 
Don't be cruel 
Oh you don't know the power 
In what you're saying 
Oh ... 
And so he froze where he stood 
And he looked to the ground 
And he cried 
He cried 
People where 
I come from 
They survive without feelings or blood 
I never could 
Was stoned to death 
But I'm still living 
So he froze where he stood 
And he looked to the ground 
And he cried 
He cried 
So he froze 
And he looked, and he looked 
To the ground 
And he cried 
He cried

 

SORROW WILL COME IN THE END

Legalized theft 
Leaves me bereft 
I get it straight in the neck 
(Somehow expecting no less) 
A court of justice 
With no use for Truth 
Lawyer ...liar 
Lawyer ...liar 
You pleaded and squealed 
And you think you've won 
But Sorrow will come 
To you in the end 
And as sure as my words are pure 
I praise the day that brings you pain 
Q.C.'s obsessed with sleaze 
Frantic for Fame 
They're all on the game 
They just use a different name 
You lied 
And you were believed 
By a J.P. senile and vile 
You pleaded and squealed 
And you think you've won 
But Sorrow will come 
To you in the end 
And as sure as my words are pure 
I praise the day that brings you pain 
So don't close your eyes 
Don't close your eyes 
A man who slits throats 
Has time on his hands 
And I'm gonna get you 
So don't close your eyes 
Don't ever close your eyes 
You think you've won 
OH NO

 

SATAN REJECTED MY SOUL

Satan rejected my soul 
He knows my kind 
He won't be dragged down 
He's seen my face around 
He knows Heaven doesn't seem 
To be my home 
So I must find 
Somewhere else to go 
So I must find 
Somewhere else to go 
So, take it - please 
It's free 
You'll never see 
You'll never see 
All the fun in life it's cost me 
Satan rejected my soul 
As low as he goes 
He never quite goes this low 
He's seen my face around 
He knows Heaven doesn't seem 
To be my home 
So I must find 
Somewhere else to go 
So I must find 
Somewhere else to go 
So, take it please 
It's really sly 
Come on, come on, ah Come on, come on, come on 
Take it please, It's really sly 
Come on, come on, ah Come on, come on, come on 
Call me in, Pull me in, call me in 
Come on, come on, oh Come on, come on, come on 
Pull me in, pull me in, Call me in, haul me in, pull me in 
Come on, come on, ah, Come on, come on 
La la la la la, Oh ...

 
 REEL AROUND THE FOUNTAIN

It's time the tale was told
of how you took a child
and you made him old
Reel around the fountain
slap me on the patio
I'll take it now
Fifteen minutes with you
well, I wouldn't say no
people said that you were virtually dead
and they were so wrong
fifteen minutes with you
well, i wouldn't say no
people said that you were easily led
and they were half-right
I dreamt about you last night
and i fell out of bed twice
you can pin and mount me like a butterfly
but take me to the haven of your bed
was something that you never said
two lumps, please
you're the bee's knees
but so am I
Meet me at the fountain
shove me on the patio
I'll take it slowly
Fifteen minutes with you
oh I wouldn't say no
people see no worth in you
oh but I do

 

YOU'VE GOT EVERYTHING NOW

As merry as the days were long
I was right and you were wrong
back at the old grey school
I would win and you would lose
But you've got everything now
and what a terrible mess I've made of my life
No, I've never had a job
because I've never wanted one
I've seen you smile
but I've never really heard you laugh
So who is rich and who is poor?
I cannot say...
You are your mother's only son
and you're a desperate one
But I don't want a lover
I just want to be seen in the back of your car
A friendship sadly lost?
Well, this is true ...and yet, it's false
Did I ever tell you , by the way
I never did like your face
But you've got everything now
and what a terrible mess I've made of my life
No, I've never had a job
because I'm too shy
But I don't want a lover
I just want to be tied to the back of your car.

 

MISERABLE LIE

So, goodbye
please stay with your own kind
and I'll stay with mine
There's something against us
it's not time
So, goodbye
I know I hardly say
how much I love your casual way
but please put your tongue away
a little higher and we're well away
the dark nights are drawing in
and your humour is as black as them
I look at yours, you laugh at mine
and"love" is just a miserable lie
you have destroyed my flower like-life
not once-but twice
you have corrupt my innocent mind
not once-but twice
I know that wind-swept mystical air
it means: I'd like to see your underwear
I recognise that mystical air
it means: I'd like to see your underwear
what do we get for the trouble and pain?
just a rented room in Whalley Range
into the depths of the criminal world
I followed her...
I need advice, I need advice
because nobody ever looks at me twice
I'm just a country-mile behind
the world
I'm just a country mile behind
the whole world
so take me when you go

 

PRETTY GIRLS MAKE GRAVES

Upon the sand,upon the bay
"there is a quick and easy way" you say
before you illustrate
I'd rather state:
"I'm not the man you think I am
I'm not the man you think I am "
And Sorrow's native son
he will not smile for anyone
And pretty girls makes the graves
End of the pier, end of the bay
you tug my arm and say:"Give into lust,
give up to lust, oh heaven knows we'll
soon be dust..."
But I'm not the man you think I am
I'm not the man you think I am
And Sorrow's native son
he will not rise for anyone
And pretty girls make graves
I could have been wild and I could have been free
but Nature played this trick on me
She wants it Now
and she will not wait
but she's too rough
and I'm too delicate
Then on the sand
another man, he takes her hand
and a smile lights up her stupid face
(and well, it would)
I lost my faith in Womanhood
I lost my faith in Womanhood, I lost my faith

 

THE HAND THAT ROCKS THE CRADLE

Please don't cry
the ghost and the storm outside
will not invade this sacred shire
nor infiltrate your mind
my life down I shall lie
if the bogey-man should try
to play tricks on your sacred mind
to tease, torment and tantalise
wavering shadows loom
a piano plays in an empty room
there'll be blood on the cleaver tonight
when darkness lifts and the room is bright
I'll still be by your side
for you are all that matters
and I'll love you till the day I die
there never need to be longing in your eyes
as long as the hand that rocks the cradle is mine
ceiling shadows shimmy by
and when the wardrobe towers like a beast of prey
there's a sadness in your beautiful eyes
you're untouched, unsoiled, wonderous eyes
my life down I shall lie
should restless spirts try
to play tricks on you sacred mind
but whom I never gave a name
I just looked into his wonderous eyes
and said" never never never again"
all too soon I did return
just like a moth to a flame
so rattle my bones all over the stones
because I'm only a beggar-man whom nobody owns
see how words as old as sin
fit me like a glove I'm here and here I'll stay
together we lie, together we pray
there never need be longing in your eyes
as long as the hand that rocks the cradle is mine

 

STILL ILL

I decree today that life
is simply taking and not giving
England is mine and it owes me a living
ask me why, and I'll spit in your eye
ask me why, and I'll spit in your eye
but we cannot cling to the old dreams anymore
no, we cannot cling to the old dreams anymore
Does the body rule the mind
or does the mind rule the body?
I dunno...
Under the iron bridge we kissed
and although I ended up with sore lips
it just wasn't like the old days anymore
no, it wasn't like those days
am I still ill?
Does the body rule the mind
or does the mind rule the body ?
I dunno...
Ask me why, and I'll die
ask me why, and I'll die
and if you must go to work tomorrow
well, if I were you I wouldn't bother
for there are brighter sides to life
and I should know because I've seen them
but not very often...
under the iron bridge we kissed
and although I ended up with sore lips
it just wasn't like the old days anymore
no, it wasn't like those days
am I still ill?

 

HAND IN GLOVE

Hand in glove
the sun shines out of our behinds
no, it's not like any other love
this one is different-because it's us
Hand in glove
we can go wherever we please
and everything depends upon
how near you stand to me
And if the people stare
then the people stare
I really don't know and I really don't care
Hand in glove
the Good People laugh
yes, we may be hidden by rags
but we have something they'll never have
So, hand in glove I stake my claim
I'll fight to the last breath
If they dare touch a hair on your head
I'll fight to the last breath
The Good Life is out there, somewhere
so stay on my arm, you little charmer
But I know my luck too well
and I'll probably never see you again.

 

WHAT DIFFERENCE DOES IT MAKE?

All men have secrets and here is mine
so let it be known
we have been through hell and high tide,
I can surely rely on you?
and yet you start to recoil,
heavy words are so lightly thrown
but still I'd leap in front of a flying bullet for you
So, what difference does it make?
so, what difference does it make?
it makes none
but you have gone
and you must be looking very old tonight
The devil will find work for idle hands to do
I stole and I lied, and why?
because you asked me to!
but now you make feel so ashamed
because I've only got two hands
well, I'm still fond of you
So, what difference does it make?
so, what difference does it make?
it makes none
but you have gone
and your prejudice won't keep you warm tonight
So, no more apologies
no more apologies
I'm too tired
I'm too sick and tired
and I'm feeling very sick and ill today
But I'm still fond of you

 

I DON'T OWE YOU ANYTHING

Bought on stolen wine
a nod was the first step
you know very well
what was coming next
did I really walk all this way
just to hear you say
"oh I don't want to go out tonight"
but you will
for you must
I don't owe you anything
but you owe me something
repay me now
you should never go to them
let them come to you
just like I do
you should not go to them
let them come to you
just like I do
Too freely on your lips
words prematurely said
oh but I know what will make you smile tonight
Life is never kind
life is never kind
oh but I know what will make you smile tonight

 

SUFFER LITTLE CHILDREN

Over the moors,take me to the moors
dig a shallow grave
and I'll lay me down
Lesley-Anne, with your pretty white beads
oh John, you'll never be a man
and you'll never see your home again
oh Manchester, so much to answer for
Edward, see those alluring lights?
tonight will be your very last night
a woman said "I know my son is dead
I'll never rest my hands on his scared head"
Hindley wakes and Hindley says:
"Wherever he has gone, I have gone "
But fresh lilaced moorland fields
cannot hide the stoild stench of death
Hindley wakes and Hindley says:
"Whatever he has done, I have done"
But this is no easy ride
for a child cries
"find me...find me, nothing more
we're on a sullen misty moor
we may be dead and we may be gone
but we will be right by your side
until the day you die
this is no easy ride
we will haunt you when you laugh
yes, you could say we're a team
you might sleep
BUT YOU WILL NEVER DREAM!"
Oh Manchester, so much to answer for
Oh Manchester, so much to answer for
Over the moor, I'm on the moor
the child is on the moor

 

THE HEADMASTER RITUAL

Belligerent ghouls

Belligerent ghouls

spineless bastards all

RUSHOLME RUFFIANS

The last night at the fair
by the big wheel generator
a boy is stabbed
and his money is grabbed
and the air hangs heavy like a dulling wine
she is famous
she is funny
an engagement ring
doesn't mean a thing
to a mind consumed by brass(money)
and though I walk home alone
my faith in love is still devout
the last night at the fair
from a seat on a whirling waltzer
her skirt ascends for a watching eye
it's a hideous trait( on her mother's side)
and though I walk home alone
my faith in love is still devout
then someone falls in love
and someone's beaten up
and the senses being dulled are mine

of a speedway operator
is all a tremulous heart requires
a schoolgirl is denied
she said "How quickly would I die
if I jumped from the top of the parachutes?"

I WANT THE ONE I CAN'T HAVE

On the day that your mentality
catches up with your biology
I want the one I can't have
and it's driving me mad
it's written all over my face
A double-bed
and a stalwart lover, for sure
these are the riches of the poor
A double-bed
and a stalwart lover, for sure
these are the riches of the poor
a tough kid who sometimes swallows nails
raised on Prisoner's Aid
he killed a policeman when he was thirteen
and somehow that really impressed me
it's written all over my face
On the day that your mentality
catches up with your biology
And if you ever need self-validation
just meet me in the alley by the
railway-station
it's written all over my face

 

WHAT SHE SAID

What she said:
"How come someone hasn't noticed
that I'm dead
and decided to bury me
God knows, I'm ready"
What she said was
but then, all the rejection she's had
to pretend to be happy
could only be idiocy
What she said was not for the job or
lover that she never had
What she read
all heady books
she'd sit and prophesise
(it took a tattoed boy from Birkenhead
to really really open her eyes)

THAT JOKE ISN'T FUNNY ANYMORE

Park the car at the side of the road
you should know
time's tide will smother you
and I will too
when you laugh about other people who feel so
very lonely
their only desire is to die
well I'm afraid
it doesn't make me smile
I wish I could laugh
but that joke isn't funny anymore
it's too close to home and it's too near the bone
it's too close to home and it's too near the bone
more than you'll ever know
It was dark as I drove the point home
and on cold leather seats
well, it suddenly struck me
I just might die with a smile on my
face after all
I've seen this happen in other people's lives
and now it's happening in mine

 

NOWHERE FAST

I'd like to drop my trousers to the world
I am a man of means(of slender means)
each household appliance
is like a new science in my town
and if a day came when I felt a natural emotion
I'd get such a shock I'd probably jump in the ocean
and when a train goes by
it's such a sad sound
I'd like to drop my trousers to the Queen
every sensible child will know what this means
the poor and the needy
are selfish and greedy on her terms
and if the day came when I felt a natural emotion
I'd get such a shock I'd probably jump in the ocean
and when a train goes by
it's such a sad song
And when I'm lying in my bed
I think about life
and I think about death
and neither one particularly appeals to me
and if the day came when I felt a natural emotion
I'd get such a shock I'd probably lie
in the middle of the street and die
I'd lie down and die

 

WELL I WONDER

Well I wonder
do you hear me when you sleep?
I hoarsely cry
Well I wonder
do you see me when we pass?
I half-die
Please keep me in mind
please keep me in mind
Gasping-but somehow still alive
this is the fierce last stand of all I am
Gasping-dying-but somehow still alive
this is the final stand of all I am
Please keep me in mind

 

BARBARISM BEGINS AT HOME

Unruly boys
who will not grow up
must be taken in hand
Unruly girls
who will not settle down
they must be taken in hand
A crack on the head
is what you get for not asking
and a crack on the head

MEAT IS MURDER

Heifer whines could be human cries
closer comes the screaming knife
this beautiful creature must die
this beautiful creature must die
a death for no reason
and death for reason is MURDER
and the flesh you so fancifully fry
is not succulent, tasty or nice
it's death for no reason
and death for no reason is MURDER
and the calf that you carve with a smile
is MURDER
and the turkey you festively slice
is MURDER
do you know how animals die?
kitchen aroma aren't very homely
it's not "comforting," "cheery" or kind
it's sizzling blood and the unholy stench
of MURDER
it's not "natural," "normal" or kind
the fleas you so fancifully fry
as you savour the flavour
of MURDER
NO, NO, NO, IT'S MURDER
NO, NO, NO, IT'S MURDER
who hears when animals cry?

 

THE QUEEN IS DEAD

Farewell to this lands cheerless marches
hemmed in like a boar between arches
her very Lowness with her head in a sling
Im truely sorry-but it sounds like a wonderful thing
dear Charles, dont you ever crave
to appear on the front of the Daily mail
dressed in your Mother's bridal veil?
So, I checked all the registered historical facts
and I was shocked into shame to discover
how Im the 18th pale descendent
of some, old queen or other
has the world changed, or have I changed?
has the world changed, or have I changed?
as some 9-year old tough peddles drugs
(I never even knew what drugs were)
And so, I broke into the Palace
with a sponge and a rusty spanner
she said: "Eh, I know you, and you cannot sing"
I said: "that's nothing -you should hear me play piano"
We can go for a walk where it's quiet and dry
and we can talk about precious things
but when you are tied to your mother's apron
not one talks about castration
We can go for a walk where it's quiet and dry
and we can talk about precious things
like love and law and poverty
these are the things that kill me
We can go for a walk where it's quiet and dry
and we can talk about precious things
but the rain that flattens my hair
theses are the things that kill me
Passed the Pub that saps your body
and the church who'll snatch your money
the Queen is dead, boys
and it's so lonely on a limb
Pass the Pub that wrecks your body
and the church-all they want is your money
the Queen is dead, boys`
you can trust me, boys
life is very long, when you're lonely
life is very long, when you're lonely...

 

FRANKLY MR.SHANKLY

Frankly, Mr Shankly, this position Ive held
it pays my way, but it corrodes my soul
I want to leave you will not miss me
I want to go down in musical history
Frankly, Mr Shankly, Im a sickening wreck
Ive got the 21st Century breathing down my neck
I must move fast, you understand me
I want to go down in celluloid history
Fame, Fame, fatal Fame
it can play hideous tricks on the brain
but still I rather be Famous
than righteous or holy, any day
but sometimes Id feel more fulfilled
making Christmas cards with the mentally ill
I want to Live and I want to Love
I want to catch something that I might be ashamed of
Frankly, Mr Shankly, this position I've held
it pays my way and it corrodes my soul
oh, I didnt realise that you wrote poetry
(I didnt realise you wrote such bloody awful poetry)
Frankly, Mr Shankly, since you ask
you are a flatulent pain the arse
I do not mean to be so rude
but still, I must speck frankly, Mr Shankly

 

I KNOW IT'S ALL OVER

Oh Mother, I can fell the soil falling over my head
and as i climb into an empty bed
Oh well, Enough said
I know it's over-still I cling
I don't know where else I can go
Oh Mother, I can feel the soil falling over my head
see, the sea want s to take me
the knife wants to cut me
do you think you can help me?
Sad veiled bride, please be happy
handsome groom, give her room
loud, loutish lover, treat her kindly
(although she needs you
more than she loves you)
and I know it's over
and it never really began
but in my heart it was so real
and you even spoke to me and said:
"If you're so funny
then why are you on your own tonight?
and if you are so clever
then why are you on your own tonight?
if you're so terribly good looking
then why do you sleep alone tonight?
because tonight is just like any other night
that's why you're on your own tonight
with your triumphs and your charms
while they are in each other's arms.."
It's so easy to laugh
it's so easy to hate
it takes strength to be gentle and kind
It's so easy to laugh
it's so easy to hate
it takes guts to be gentle and kind
love is Natural and Real
but not for you, my love
not tonight my love
love is Natural and Real
but not for such as you and I, my love
Oh Mother, I can fell the soil falling over my head
Oh Mother, I can fell the soil falling over my head...

 

NEVER HAD NO ONE EVER

When you walk without ease
on these
the very streets where you were raised
I had a really bad dream
it lasted 20 years, 7 months, and 27 days
Never had no one ever.

 

CEMETERY GATES

A dreaded sunny day
so I meet you at the cemetry gates
Keats and Yeats are on your side
A dreaded sunny day
so I meet you at the cemetry gates
Keats and Yeats are on your side
while Wilde is on mine
So we go inside and we gravely read the stones
all those people all those lives
where are they now ?
with loves, and hates
and passions just like mine
they were born
and then they lived and then they died
which seems so unfair
and I wantr to crv
You say: "ere thrice the sun hath done salutation to the dawn"
and you claim these words as your own
but Im well-read, have heard them said
a hundred times (maybe less, maybe more)
if you must write prose/poems
the words you use should be your own
dont plagiarise or take "on loans"
there's alweays someone, somewhere
with a big nose, who knows
and who trips you up and laughs
when you fall
You say: "ere long done do does did "
words which could only be your own
you then produce the text
from whence was ripped
(some dizzy whore, 1804)
A dreaded sunny day
so let's go where we're happy
so I meet you at the cemetry gates
Keats and Yeats are on your side
A dreaded sunny day
so let's go where we're wanted
so I meet you at the cemetry gates
Keats and Yeats are on your side
but you lose
because Wilde is on mine

 

BIGMOUTH STRIKES AGAIN

Sweetness, sweetness I was only joking
when I said Id like to smash every tooth
in your head
Sweetness, sweetness I was only joking
when I said by right s you should be
bludgeoned in your bed
and now I know how Joan of Arc felt
now I know how Joan of Arc felt
as the flames roseto her roman nose
and her Walkman stared to melt
Bibmouth, bigmouth
bigmouth strikes again
and Ive got no right to take my place
with the Human race
and now I know how Joan of Arc felt
now I know of Joan of Arc felt
as the flames rose to her roman nose
and her hearing aid started to melt
Bigmouth, bigmouth
bigmouth strikes again
and Ive got no right to take my place

THE BOY WITH A THORN IN HIS SIDE

The boy with the thorn in his side
behind the hatred there lies
a murderous desire for love
how can they look into my eyes
and still they dont believe me
how can they hear me say those words
and still they dont believe me
and if they don't believe me now
will they ever believe me?
and if they don't believe me now
will they ever believe me?
The boy with the thorn in his side
behind the hatred there lies
a plundering desire for love
how can they see the Love in our eyes
and still they don't believe us
and after all this time
they don't want to believe us
and if they dont believe us now
will they ever believe us ?
andd when you want to Live
how do you start ?
where do you go ?
who do you know?

 

VICAR IN A TUTU

I was minding mind business
lifting some lead off
the roof of the Holy Name church
it was worthwhile living a laughable life
just to set my eyes on a blistering sight
of a vicar in a tu-tu
he's not strange
he just wants to live his life this way
a scanty bit of a thing
with a decorative ring
that wouldn't cover the head of a child
as Rose collects the money in the cannister
who comes sliding down the bannister
the vicar in a tu-tu
he's not strange
he just wants to live his life this way
the monkish monsignor
with a head full of plaster
said "my man, get your vile soul dry-cleaned"
as Rose counts the money in the cannister
as natural as rain
he dances again
vicar in a tu-tu
The next day in the pulpit
with Freedom and Ease
combating ignoranca,dust and disease
as Rose counts the money in the cannister
as natural as rain
he dances again
the fabric of a tu-tu
any man could get us to
and I am a living sign.

 

THERE IS A LIGHT THAT NEVER GOES OUT

Take me out tonight
where there's music and there's people
who are young and alive
driving in your car
I never never want to go home
because I havent got one
anymore
take me out tonight
because I want to see people and I
want to see lights
driving in your car
oh please dont drop me home
because it's not my home, it's their
home, and Im welcome no morw
and if a double-decker bus
crashes in to us
to die by your side
such a heavenly way to die
and if a ten ton truck
kills the both of us
to die by your side
the pleasure and the privilege is mine
take me out tonight
oh take me anywhere, I dont care
and in the darken underpass
I thought Oh God, my chance has come at last
(but then a strange fear gripped me and I just couldn't ask)
take me out tonight
take me anywhere, I dont care
just driving in your car
I never never want to go home
because I havent got one
I havent got one.

 

SOME GIRLS ARE BIGGER THAN OTHERS

From the ice-age to the dole-age
there is but one concern
and I have just discover
some girls are bigger than others
some girls are bigger than others
some girls mothers are bigger than
other girls mothers
As Anthony said to Cleopatra
as he opened a crate of ale:
some girls are bigger than others
some girls are bigger than others
some girls mothers are bigger than
other girls mothers.

 

A RUSH AND A PUSH AND AND THE LAND IS OURS

HELLO
I am the ghost of Troubled Joe
hung by his pretty white neck
some eighteen months ago
I travelled to a mystical time zone
but I missed my bed
so I soon came home
they said:
"there's too much caffeine
in your bloodstream
and a lack of real spice
in your life"
I said:
"leave me alone
because I'm alright, dad
just surprised to still
be on my own...."
Ooh, but don't mention love
I'd hate the real strain of the pain again
a rush and a push and the land that
we stand on is ours
it has been before
so it shall be again
and people who are uglier than you and I
they take what they need, and leave
Ooh, but don't mention love
I'd hate the pain and the strain all over again
a rush and a push and the land that
we stand on is ours
it has been before
so why can't it be now?
and people who are weaker than you and I
they take what they want from life
Ooh, but don't mention love
no - just don't mention love!
a rush and a push and the land that
we stand on is ours
your youth may be gone
but you're still a young man
so phone me, phone me, phone me
so phone me, phone me, phone me
Ooh, I think I'm in love...
Urrgh, I think I'm in lerv

 

I STARTED SOMETHING I COULDN'T FINISH

The lanes were silent
with nothing or no one around for miles
I doused our friendly venture
with a hard-faced
three-word gesture
I started something
I forced you into a zone
and you were clearly
never meant to go
hair brushed and parted
typical me, typical me, typical me
I started something
...and now I'm not too sure
I grabbed you by the guilded beams
that's what Tradition means
and I doused another venture
with a gesture
that was...absolutely vile
I started something
forced you to a zone
and you were clearly
never meant to go
hair brushed and parted
typical me, typical me, typical me
I started something
...and now I'm not too sure
I grabbed you by the guilded beams
that's what Tradition means
and now eighteen months' hard-labour
seems...fair enough

DEATH OF A DISCO DANCER

The death of a disco dancer
well, it happens a lot 'round here
and if you think Peace
is a common goal
well, that goes to show
just how little you know
The death of a disco dancer
well, I'd rather not get involved
I never talk to my neighbour
I'd just rather not get involved
Love, peace and harmony?
Love, peace and harmony?
Oh, very nice, very nice, very nice, very nice
...but maybe in the next world.

 

GIRLFRIEND IN A COMA

Girlfriend in a coma, I know
I know - it's serious
Girlfriend in a coma, I know
I know - it's really serious
there wree times when I could
have 'murdered' her
(but, you know, I would hate
anything to happen to her)
NO, I DON'T WANT TO SEE HER
Do you really think
she'll pull through?

she'll pull through?
Girlfriend in a coma, I know

STOP ME IF YOU'VE HEARD THIS ONE BEFORE

Stop me, stop me,
stop me if you think that you've heard this one before
stop me, stop me
stop me if you think that you've heard this one before
nothing's changed
I still love you, oh I still love you
...only slightly less than I used to
I was delayed, I was way-laid
an emergency stop
I smelt the last ten seconds of life
I crashed down on the crossbar
and the pain was enough to make
a shy, bald buddhist reflect
and plan a mass-murder
who said I'd lied to her?
who said I'd lied because I never
who said I'd lied because I never
I was detained, I was restrained
he broke my spleen
he broke my knees
(and then he really laid into me)
Friday night in Out-patients
who said I'd lied to her?
who said I'd lied - because I never
who said I'd lied - because I never
Oh, so I drank one
or was it four
and when I fell on the floor
...I drank more
stop me, stop me
stop me if you think that you've heard this one before
nothing's changed
I still love you, I still love you
but only slightly
less than I used to

 

LAST NIGHT I DREAMT THAT SOMEBODY LOVED ME

Last night I dreamt
that somebody loved me
no hope - but no harm
just another false alarm
Las night I felt
real arms around me
no hope - no harm
just another false alarm
so, tell me how long
before the last one?
and tell me how long
before the right one?
this story is old - I KNOW
but it goes on
this story is old - I KNOW
but it goes on

 

UNHAPPY BIRTHDAY

I've come to wish you an unhappy birthday
I've come to wish you an unhappy birthday
because you're evil
and you lie
and if you should die
I may feel slightly sad
(but I won't cry)
Loved and lost
and some may say
when usually its Nothing
surely you're happy
it should be this way?
I say "No, I'm gonna kill my dog"
and: "May the lines sag heavy
and deep tonight XXX"
I've come to wish you an unhappy birthday
I've come to wish you an unhappy birthday
because you're evil
and you lie
and if you should die
I may feel slightly sad
(But I won't cry)
Loved and lost
some people say
when usually its Nothing
surely you're happy
it should be this way?
I said "No"
and then I shot myself
so, drink, drink, drink
and be ill tonight
from the one you left behind
from the one you left behind...

 

PAINT A VULGAR PICTURE

At the record company meeting
On their hands - a dead star
and ooh, the plans that they weave
and ooh, the sikening greed
At the record company meeting
on their hands - a dead star
the sycophantic slags all say:
"I knew him first, and I knew him well"
Re-issue! Re-package! Re-package!
Re-evaluate the songs
double-pack with a photograph
Extra Track (and a tacky badge)
A-list, playlist
"Please them, please them!"
"Please them! Please them!"
(sadly, THIS was your life)
but you could have said no
if you'd wanted to
you could have said no
if you'd wanted to
BPI, MTV, BBC
"Please them! Please them!"
(sadly this was your life)
but you could have said no
if you'd wanted to
you could have walked away
...couldn't you?
I touched you at the soundcheck
you had no real way of knowing
in my heart I bgged "please, take
me with you...
I don't care where you're going"
But to you I was faceless
I was fawning, I was boring
just a child from those ugly new houses
who could never begin to know
who could never really know
Best of? Most of?
Satiate the need
slip them into different sleeves!
Buy both, and be decieved
climber - new entry, re-entry
World tour! ("media whore")
"Please the Press in Belgium!"
(THIS was your life...)
and when it fails to recoup?
Well, maybe:
You just haven't earned it yet, baby
I walked a pace behind you at the soundcheck
you're just the same as I am
what makes most people feel happy
leads us headlong into harm
so, in my bedroom in those 'ugly new houses'
I dance my legs down to the knees
but me and my 'true love'
we will never meet again...
At the record company meeting
on their hands - at last! - a dead star!
but they cannot taint you in my eyes
no, they cannout touch you now
No, they cannot hurt you my darling
they cannot touch you now
but me and my 'true love'
will never meet again

 

DEATH AT ONE'S ELBOW

Ooh Glenn, don't come to the house tonight
Ooh, Glenn, don't come to the house tonight
because there's somebody here
who really really loves you
stay home
be bored
(it's crap, I KNOW)
Ooh, Glenn, don't come to the house tonight
Ooh, Glen, don't come to the house tonight
because there's somebody here
who'll take a hatchet to your ear
how the frustration renders me
hateful, Glenn!
don't come to the house tonight
don't come to the house tonight
because you'll slip on the
trail of my bespattered remains
and so, that's why
GOODBYE MY LOVE, GOODBYE MY LOVE, GOODBYE MY LOVE...
Belch

 

I WON'T SHARE YOU

I won't share you
I won't share you
with the drive and ambition
and the zeal I feel
this is my time
as the note I wrote
was read, she said
has the Perrier gone
straight to my head
or is life plainly sick and cruel, instead?
"YES!"
No-no-no-no-no-no
I won't share you
I won't share you
with the drive and the dreams inside
this is my time
Life tends to come and go
well, that's OK
just as long as you know
Life tends to come and go
well, that's OK
just as long as you know
I won't share you
I won't share you
with the drive and the dreams inside
this is my time, this is my time


THE QUEEN IS DEAD

Farewell to this lands cheerless marches
hemmed in like a boar between arches
her very Lowness with her head in a sling
Im truely sorry-but it sounds like a wonderful thing
dear Charles, dont you ever crave
to appear on the front of the Daily mail
dressed in your Mother's bridal veil?
So, I checked all the registered historical facts
and I was shocked into shame to discover
how Im the 18th pale descendent
of some, old queen or other
has the world changed, or have I changed?
has the world changed, or have I changed?
as some 9-year old tough peddles drugs
(I never even knew what drugs were)
And so, I broke into the Palace
with a sponge and a rusty spanner
she said: "Eh, I know you, and you cannot sing"
I said: "that's nothing -you should hear me play piano"
We can go for a walk where it's quiet and dry
and we can talk about precious things
but when you are tied to your mother's apron
not one talks about castration
We can go for a walk where it's quiet and dry
and we can talk about precious things
like love and law and poverty
these are the things that kill me
We can go for a walk where it's quiet and dry
and we can talk about precious things
but the rain that flattens my hair
theses are the things that kill me
Passed the Pub that saps your body
and the church who'll snatch your money
the Queen is dead, boys
and it's so lonely on a limb
Pass the Pub that wrecks your body
and the church-all they want is your money
the Queen is dead, boys`
you can trust me, boys
life is very long, when you're lonely
life is very long, when you're lonely...

 

PANIC

Panic on the streets of London
Panic on the streets of Birmingham
I wonder to myself
Could life ever be sane again
on the Leeds side-streets that you slip down
I wonder to myself
Hopes may rise on the Grasmeres
But Honey Pie, you're not safe here
So you run down
To the safety of the town
But there's Panic on the streets of Carlisle
Dublin, Dundee, Humberside
I wonder to myself
Burn down the Disco
Hang the blessed D.J.
Because the music that they constantly play
IT SAYS NOTHING TO ME ABOUT MY LIFE
Hang the blessed D.J.
Because the music they constantly play
On the Leeds side-streets that you slip down
On the provincial towns that you jog 'round
Hang the D.J.,. Hang the D.J.,.Hang the D.J...

 

VICAR IN A TUTU

I was minding mind business
lifting some lead off
the roof of the Holy Name church
it was worthwhile living a laughable life
just to set my eyes on a blistering sight
of a vicar in a tu-tu
he's not strange
he just wants to live his life this way
a scanty bit of a thing
with a decorative ring
that wouldn't cover the head of a child
as Rose collects the money in the cannister
who comes sliding down the bannister
the vicar in a tu-tu
he's not strange
he just wants to live his life this way
the monkish monsignor
with a head full of plaster
said "my man, get your vile soul dry-cleaned"
as Rose counts the money in the cannister
as natural as rain
he dances again
vicar in a tu-tu
The next day in the pulpit
with Freedom and Ease
combating ignoranca,dust and disease
as Rose counts the money in the cannister
as natural as rain
he dances again
the fabric of a tu-tu
any man could get us to
and I am a living sign.

 

ASK

Shyness is nice, but
Shyness can stop you
From doing all the things in life
That you'd like to
So, if there's something you'd like to try
ASK ME-I WON'T SAY "NO"-HOW COULD I?
Coyness is nice, but ,
Coyness can stop you
from saying all the things in
life that you want to
If there's something that you'd like to try
ASK ME-I WON'TSAY"NO"-HOW COULD I?
Spending warm, Summer days indoors
Writing fringhtening verse
To a buck-toothed girl in Luxembourg
ASK ME, ASK ME ,ASK ME, ASK ME, ASK ME ,ASK ME
Because if it's not Love
Then it's the Bomb
That will bring us together
Nature is a language-can't you read?
Nature is a language-can't you read?
ASK ME, ASK ME ,ASK ME, ASK ME, ASK ME ,ASK ME
Because if it's not Love
Then it's the Bomb
That will bring us together

 

MARIE'S THE NAME (HIS LATEST FLAME) / RUSHOLME RUFFIANS

Very old friend 
Came by today 
As he was telling everyone in town 
Of all the love that he'd just found 
And Marie's the name (of his latest flame) 
Talked and talked 
And I heard him say 
That she had the longest blackest hair 
Prettiest green eyes anywhere 
And Marie's the name (of his latest flame) 
The last night of the fair 
By the big wheel generator 
A boy is stabbed 
His money is grabbed 
And the air hangs heavy like a dulling wine 
She is Famous 
She is Funny 
An engagement ring 
Doesn't mean a thing 
To a mind consumed by brass (money), oh 
The last night of the fair 
From a seat on a whirling waltzer 
Her skirt ascends for a watching eye 
It's a hideous trait (on her mother's side)
From a seat on a whirling waltzer 
Her skirt ascends for a watching eye 
A hideous trait (on her mother's side) 
Then someone falls in love 
Someone's beaten up 
Someone's beaten up 
And the senses being dulled are mine 
And someone falls in love 
Someone's beaten up 
And the senses being dulled are mine 
This is the last night of the fair 
And the grease in the hair 
Of a speedway operator 
Is all a tremulous heart requires 
A schoolgirl is denied 
She said : "How quickly would I die 
If I jumped from the top of the parachutes ?"
This is the last night of the fair 
And the grease in the hair 
Of a speedway operator 
Is all a tremulous heart requires 
A schoolgirl is denied 
She said : "How quickly would I die 
Oh, if I jumped from the top of the parachutes ?"
...Oh, walk home alone 
I might walk home alone 
But my faith in love is still devout

 

THE BOY WITH THE THORN IN HIS SIDE

The boy with the thorn in his side
behind the hatred there lies
a murderous desire for love
how can they look into my eyes
and still they dont believe me
how can they hear me say those words
and still they dont believe me
and if they don't believe me now
will they ever believe me?
and if they don't believe me now
will they ever believe me?
The boy with the thorn in his side
behind the hatred there lies
a plundering desire for love
how can they see the Love in our eyes
and still they don't believe us
and after all this time
they don't want to believe us
and if they dont believe us now
will they ever believe us ?
andd when you want to Live
how do you start ?
where do you go ?
who do you know?

 

RUBBER RING / WHAT SHE SAID

Yeah! What she says : 
"How come someone hasn't noticed 
That I'm dead 
And decided to bury me ? 
God knows, I'm ready !"
La-la-la ... 
What she said was sad 
But then, all the rejection she's had 
To pretend to be happy 
Could only be idiocy 
La-la-la ... 
What she said was not for the job or 
Lover that she never had 
No no no ... 
What she read 
All heady books 
She'd sit and prophesise 
(It took a tattooed boy from 
Birkenhead 
To really really open her eyes)

IS IT REALLY SO STRANGE?

I left the North 
I travelled South 
I found a tiny house 
And I can't help the way I feel 
Oh yes, you can kick me 
And you can punch me 
And you can break my face 
But you won't change the way I feel 
'Cause I love you, Oh ... 
And is it really so strange ? 
Oh, is it really so strange ? 
Oh, is it really so, really so strange ? 
I say NO, you say YES 
(and you will change your mind) 
I left the South 
I travelled North 
I got confused - I killed a horse 
I can't help the way I feel 
Oh yes, you can punch me 
And you can butt me 
And you can break my spine 
But you won't change the way I feel 
'Cause I love you, Oh ... 
And is it really so strange ? 
Oh, is it really so strange ? 
Oh, is it really so, really so strange ? 
I say NO, you say YES 
(But you will change your mind) 
I left the North again 
I travelled South again 
And I got confused - I killed a nun 
I CAN'T HELP THE WAY I FEEL 
(I lost my bag in Newport Pagnell) 
Why is the last mile the hardest mile ? 
My throat was dry, with the sun in my eyes 
And I realised, I realised 
I could never 
I could never, never, never, go back home again

 

CEMETERY GATES

A dreaded sunny day
so I meet you at the cemetry gates
Keats and Yeats are on your side
A dreaded sunny day
so I meet you at the cemetry gates
Keats and Yeats are on your side
while Wilde is on mine
So we go inside and we gravely read the stones
all those people all those lives
where are they now ?
with loves, and hates
and passions just like mine
they were born
and then they lived and then they died
which seems so unfair
and I wantr to crv
You say: "ere thrice the sun hath done salutation to the dawn"
and you claim these words as your own
but Im well-read, have heard them said
a hundred times (maybe less, maybe more)
if you must write prose/poems
the words you use should be your own
dont plagiarise or take "on loans"
there's alweays someone, somewhere
with a big nose, who knows
and who trips you up and laughs
when you fall
You say: "ere long done do does did "
words which could only be your own
you then produce the text
from whence was ripped
(some dizzy whore, 1804)
A dreaded sunny day
so let's go where we're happy
so I meet you at the cemetry gates
Keats and Yeats are on your side
A dreaded sunny day
so let's go where we're wanted
so I meet you at the cemetry gates
Keats and Yeats are on your side
but you lose
because Wilde is on mine

 

LONDON

Smoke
Lingers 'round your fingers
Train
Heave on - to Euston
Do you think you've made
The right decision this time?
You left
Your tired family grieving
And you think they're sad because you're leaving
But didn't you see the Jealousy in the eyes
Of the ones who had to stay behind?
And do you think you've made
The right decision thins time?
You left
Your girlfriend on the platform
With thei really ragged notion that you'll return
But she knows
That when he goes
He really goes
So do you think you've made
The right decision this time?

 

I KNOW IT'S OVER

I can feel the soil falling over my head 
And as I climb into an empty bed 
Oh well. Enough said. 
I know it's over - still I cling 
I don't know where else I can go 
Over ... 
Oh Mother, I can feel the soil falling over my head 
See, the sea wants to take me 
The knife wants to cut me 
Do you think you can help me ? 
Sad veiled bride, please be happy 
Handsome groom, give her room 
Loud, loutish lover, treat her kindly 
(Though she needs you 
More than she loves you) 
And I know it's over - still I cling 
I don't know where else I can go 
Over, it's over, it's over, it's over 
It's over, la ... 
I know it's over 
And it never really began 
But in my heart it was so real
And you even spoke to me, and said : 
"If you're so funny 
Then why are you on your own tonight ? 
And if you're so clever 
Then why are you on your own tonight ? 
I know ... 
'Cause tonight - it's just like any other night 
That's why you're on your own tonight 
Your triumphs and your charms 
While they're in each other's arms..."
It's so easy to laugh 
It's so easy to hate 
It takes strength to be gentle and kind 
Over, over, over, over 
It's so easy to laugh 
It's so easy to hate 
It takes guts to be gentle and kind 
Over, over 
Love is Natural and Real 
But not for you, my love 
Not tonight, my love 
Love is Natural and Real 
But not for such as you and I, my love 
Oh Mother, I can feel the soil falling over my head...
Oh Mother, I can feel the soil fall over, fall over my head 
Oh Mother, I can feel the ... fall over my ... , Oh ...

 

THE DRAIZE TRAIN

A vastly superior version of the instrumental B-side, acting as a peace 
offering to Marr (Morrissey chose the tracks for the compilation, 
and of course, receives no royalties on this track).

 

STILL ILL

I decree today that life
is simply taking and not giving
England is mine and it owes me a living
ask me why, and I'll spit in your eye
ask me why, and I'll spit in your eye
but we cannot cling to the old dreams anymore
no, we cannot cling to the old dreams anymore
Does the body rule the mind
or does the mind rule the body?
I dunno...
Under the iron bridge we kissed
and although I ended up with sore lips
it just wasn't like the old days anymore
no, it wasn't like those days
am I still ill?
Does the body rule the mind
or does the mind rule the body ?
I dunno...
Ask me why, and I'll die
ask me why, and I'll die
and if you must go to work tomorrow
well, if I were you I wouldn't bother
for there are brighter sides to life
and I should know because I've seen them
but not very often...
under the iron bridge we kissed
and although I ended up with sore lips
it just wasn't like the old days anymore
no, it wasn't like those days
am I still ill?

 

BIGMOUTH STRIKES AGAIN

Sweetness, sweetness I was only joking
when I said Id like to smash every tooth
in your head
Sweetness, sweetness I was only joking
when I said by right s you should be
bludgeoned in your bed
and now I know how Joan of Arc felt
now I know how Joan of Arc felt
as the flames roseto her roman nose
and her Walkman stared to melt
Bibmouth, bigmouth
bigmouth strikes again
and Ive got no right to take my place
with the Human race
and now I know how Joan of Arc felt
now I know of Joan of Arc felt
as the flames rose to her roman nose
and her hearing aid started to melt
Bigmouth, bigmouth
bigmouth strikes again
and Ive got no right to take my place
with the Human race

 
ALSATIAN COUSTIN

Were you and he Lovers?
and would you say so if you were?
on a forecourt
on a Friday
passing my way
Were you and he Lovers?
and if you were, then say that you were!
on a groundsheet
under canvas
with your tent-flap
open wide
A note upon his desk:
"P.S. Bring Me Home And Have Me!"
Leather elbows on a tweed coat
- Oh! -
Is THAT the best you can do?
So came his reply:
"...but on the desk is where I want you!"
So I ask (even though I know):
were you and he Lovers?

 

LITTLE MAN, WHAT NOW?

An afternoon nostalgia
television show
you spoke in silhouette
(but they couldn't name you)
although the panel were
very polite to you
but I remembered you
from Friday nights 1969
ATV - you murdered every line
too old to be a child star
too young to take leads
four seasons passed
and they AXED you
nervously juvenile
(WON'T SMILE!)
What became of you?
did that swift eclipse torture you?
a star at eighteen
and then-suddenly gone
down to a few lines
in the back page of a teenage annual
oh but I remembered you
I looked up to you

 

EVERYDAY IS LIKE SUNDAY

Trudging slowly over wet sand
back to the bench
where your clothes were stolen
this is the coastal town
that they forgot to close down
Armageddon - come Armageddon!
Come Armageddon! Come!
Everyday is like Sunday
everyday is silent and grey
Hide on the promenade
scratch out a postcard
"how I dearly with I was not here"
in the seaside town
...that they forgot to bomb
Come! Come! Come - nuclear bomb!
Everyday is like Sunday
everyday is silent and grey
Trudging back over pebbles and sand
and a strange dust lands on your hands
(and on your face)
Everyday is like Sunday
"Win Yourself A Cheap Tray"
share some greased tea with me
everyday is silent and grey

 

BENGALI IN PLATFORMS

No no no
he does not want to depress you
oh no no no no no
he only wants to impress you
Bengali in platform
she only wants to embrace your culture
and to be your friend forever
Bengali, Bengali
oh shelve your Western plans
and understand that life is hard enough when you belong here
A silver-studded rim that glistens
and an ankle-star that...blinds me
a lemon sole so very high
which only reminds me, to tell you
so I break the news gently
I break the news to you gently
"Shelve your plans"
Bengali, Bengali
its the touchy march of time
that blinds you
don't blame me
don't hate me
just because I'm the one to tell you
that life is hard enough when you belong here
life is hard enough when you belong here
shelve your western plans
life is hard enough when you belong here

 

ANGEL, ANGEL, DOWN WE GO TOGETHER

Angel, Angel
don't take your life tonight
I know they take
and that they take in turn
and they give you nothing real
for yourself in return
and when they've used you
and they've broken you
and wasted all your money
and cast your shell aside
and when they've bought you
and they've sold you
and they've billed you for the pleasure
and they've made your parents cry
I will be here
BELIEVE ME
I will be here
...believe me
Angel, don't take your life
some people have got no pride
they do not understand
the Urgency of life
but I love you more than life
I love you more than life
I love you more than life
I love you more than life

 

LALE NIGHT, MAUDLIN STREET

The last night on Maudlin Street
goodbye house
goodbye stairs
I was born here
I was raised here, and
...I took some stick here
love at first sight
may sound trite
but it's true, you know
I could list the details
of everything you ever wore
or said, or how you stood that day
and as we spend the last night
on Maudlin Street, I say
"goodbye house-forever!"
I never stole a happy hour
around here
Where the world's ugliest boy
became what you see
here I am - the ugliest man
Its the last night on Maudlin Street
and truly I do love you
oh, truly I do love you
When I sleep with that picture of
you framed beside my bed
oh, it's childish and it's silly
but I think it's you in my room
by the bed (...yes, I told you it was silly...)
and I know
I took strange pills
but I never meant to hurt you
oh truly I love you
I came home late one night
everyone had gone to bed
nobody stays up for you
when you have sixteen stitches
all around your head
the last buss I missed to Maudlin Street
so, he drove me home in the Van
complaining: "Women only like me for my mind..."
don't leave your torch behind
power-cuts ahead
as we crept through the park
but no I cannot steal a pair of jeans
off a clothesline for you
but you...without clothes
oh I could not keep a straight face
me - without clothes?
well a nation turns its back and gags...
I'm packed
I am moving house
a half-life disappears today
every slag waves me on
(secretly wishing me gone
well, I will be soon
oh - I will be soon)
There were bad times on Maudlin Street
when they took you away in a police car
dear Inspector - don't you know?
don't you care?
don't you know - about Love?
Your gran died
and your mother died
on Maudlin Street
in pain and ashamed
with never time to say
those special things
I took the keys from Maudlin Street
well, it's only bricks and mortar!
and...truly I do love you
wherever you are
wherever you are

 

SUEDHEAD

Why do you come here
why do you hang around
I'm so sorry
I'm so sorry
Why do you come here
when you know it makes
things hard for me
when you know, oh
why do you come?
Why do you telephone?
and why send me silly notes?
I'm so sorry
I'm so sorry
why do you come here
when you know it makes
thing hard for me
when you know, oh
why do you come?
You had to sneak into my room
'just' to read my diary
was it just to see all the things
you knew I'd written about you?
and...so many illustrations
I'm so very sickened
oh, I am so sickened NOW

 

BREAK UP THE FAMILY

The strange logic of your clumsiest line
stayed emblazoned on my mind
break up the family
and lets begin to live our lives
I went to see all my friends tonight
it wasn't Youth, it wasn't even Life
born Old, sadly wise
resigned (well, we were)
to ending our lives
I'm so glad to grow older
to move away from those awful times
I want to see all my friends tonight
Yes you found love but you weren't
at peace with your life
home late, full of Hate
despise the ties that bind
oh I'm so glad to grow older
to move away from those younger years
now I'm in love for the first time
and I don't feel bad
Let me see all my old friends
let me put my arm around them
because I really do love them
now, does that sound mad?
Captain of games, solid framed
I stood on the touchline
hailstones, driven home
in his car - no breaks? I don't mind
I'm just so glad to grow older
to move away from those darker years
I'm in love for the first time
and I don't feel bad
so wish me luck my friends
goodbye

 

HAIRDRESSER ON FIRE

Here is London
here is London
is it home of the free,
or what?
can you squeeze me
into an empty page of your diary
and psychologically save me
I've got faith in you
I sense the power
in the fingers
within an hour the power
can totally destroy me
or it could same my life
here is London
'home of the brash, outrageous
and free'
you are repressed
but you're remarkably dressed
is it Real?
but you're far to busy
busy scissors
busy clippers
hair dresser on fire
all around Sloane Square
and you're far too busy
to see me
"busy,busy"
hairdresser on fire
was a client over-cautious
he made you nervous
and when he said
"I'm gonna sue you"
I really felt for you
so can you squeeze me
into an empty page of your diary
and supernaturally change me
CHANGE ME, CHANGE ME

 

THE ORDINARY BOYS

Ordinary boys, happy knowing nothing
happy being no one, but themselves
Ordinary girls, supermarket clothes
who think it's very clever to be cruel to you
for you were so different
you stood all alone
and you knew
that it had to be so
avoiding ordinary boys
happy going nowhere, just around here
in their rattling cars
and ordinary girls
never seeing further
than the cold, small streets
that trap them
but you were so different
you had to say no
when those empty fools
tried to change you, and claim you
for the lair of their ordinary world
where they feel so lucky
so lucky, so lucky
with their lives laid out before them
they're so lucky, so lucky
so lucky, so lucky

 

I DON'T MIND IF YOU FORGET ME

I don't mind
I don't mind if you forget me
having learned my lesson
I never left an impression on anyone
so now you send me your hardened 'regards'
when once you'd send me 'love'
sincerely I must tell you
your mild 'best wishes'
they make me suspicious
but I don't mind
I don't mind if you forget me
having learned my lesson
I never left
an impression on anyone
the pressure to change, to move on
was strange
and very strong
so this is why I tell you
I really do understand
BYE BYE
I don't mind if you forget me
no no no no no no no
REJECTION IS ONE THING
BUT REJECTION FROM A FOOL
IS CRUEL
REJECTION IS ONE THING
BUT REJECTION FROM A FOOL
IS CRUEL
and I don't mind if you forget me
I don't mind if your forget me

 

DIAL-A-CLICHE

Further into the fog I fall
well, I was just
following you!
when you said:
"Do as I do and scrap your fey ways"
(dial-a-cliche)
"grow up, be a man, and close your mealy-mouth!"
(dial-a-cliche)
But the person underneath
where does he go?
does he slide by the wayside?
or...does he just die?
when you find that you've organized
your feelings, for people
who didn't like you then
and certainly don't like you now
yet still you say:
"Do as I do and scrap your fey ways"
(dial-a-cliche)
"grow up, be a man, and close your mealy-mouth!"
(dial-a-cliche)
"the Safe way is the only way!
there's always time to change, son!"
yes well I've changed
but I'm in pain!
dial-a-chiche

 

MARGARET ON THE GUILLOTINE

The kind people
have a wonderful dream
Margaret on the guillotine
because people like you
make me feel so tired
when will you die?
when will you die?
when will you die?
when will you die?
when will you die?
because people like you
make me feel so old inside
please die
and kind people
do not shelter this dream
make it real
make the dream real
make the dream real
make it real

 

OUR FRANK

Our frank and open
deep conversations
they get me nowhere
they bring me down, so
give it a rest, won't you?
give me a cigarette
God give me patience
just no more conversation
Give us a drink
and make it quick
or else I'm gonna be sick
sick all over
your frankly vulgar
red pullover
now see how the colours blend
Our frank and open
deep conversations
they get me nowhere
they bring me down, so
give it a rest, won't you?
now will you just give over
the world may be ending
but look, I'm only human
Give us a drink
and make it quick
or else I'm gonna be sick
all over
your frankly vulgar
red pullover
now see how the two colours blend
Won't somebody stop me
from thinking all the time
about everything
so deeply
so bleakly

 

ASIAN RUT

Day oh so late
strangely the sun still shone
oh Asian boy
what are you on?
Day oh so late
strangely the sun still shone
what drugs are you on?
Tooled-up Asian boy
has come here to avenge
the cruel, cold killing
of his very best friend
Tooled-up Asian boy
has come here to take revenge
for the cruel, cold killing
of his only friend
Peace through the school
so quiet in the hall
it's a strange sign for one
of what's to come
Tough and hard and pale
oh they may just impale you on railings
oh English boys
it must be wrong
three against one?
Brakes slammed, and
a gun jammed, and
as far as I could tell
brave Asian boy
dealt a blow and fell
I'm just passing through here
on my way to somewhere civilised
and maybe I'll even arrive
maybe I'll even arrive?

 

SING YOUR LIFE

Sing your life
any fool can think of words that rhyme
many others do
why don't you?
do you want to?
Sing your life
just walk right up to the microphone
and name
all the things that you love
all the things that you loathe
sing your life
all the things that you love
all the things that you loathe
oh sing your life
oh sing your life
Others sang your life
but now's your chance to shine
and have the pleasure of
saying what you mean
the rare pleasure of
meaning what you sing
oh, make no mistake, my friend
all of this will end
so sing it now
all the things you love
all the things you loathe
oh sing your life
all the things that you love
all the things that you loathe
oh sing your, oh sing your
Don't leave it all unsaid
somewhere in the wasteland of your head
and make no mistake, my friend
your pointless life will end
but before you go
can you look at the truth?
You have a lovely singing voice
a lovely singing voice
and all of those
who sing on key
they stole the notion
from you and me

 

MUTE WITNESS

Your poor witness
crying so loudly on the floor
oh but she's only trying to tell you
what it was that she saw
she is only trying to tell you
what it was that she saw
Now see her standing on the table
with her small arms flailing
and you feel such compassion
in your soul for
Your poor mute witness
still testing the strength
of our patience
oh but she's only trying to tell you
what it was that she saw
Now see her pointing to the frisbee
with a memory too fuzzy
as her silent words
describe the fright of last night
4 a.m. Norhtside, Clapham Common
who knows what she was doing there?
will she sketch the answer later?
Well, I'll ask her
"now dry your tears, my dear"
Now see her mime in time so nicely
it would all have been so clear
is only she had never volunteered
"your taxi is here, my dear"

 

KING LEER

Your boyfriend, he
went down on one knee
well, could it be
he's only got one knee?
I tried to surprise you
with Vodka
or, Tizer
I can't quite remember
but you didn't thank me
you didn't even thank me
because you never do
Your boyfriend, he
has the gift of the gab
or, could it be
the gift of the grab?
I tried to surprise you
I lay down beside you
and...nothing much happened
and you didn't phone me
you didn't even phone me
because it's not your style
to dial
Your boyfriend, he
displays to me
more than just
a hint of cruelty
I tried to surprise you
I crept up behind you
with a homeless chihuahua
you gushed for an hour
you handed him back and said
"You'll never guess
I'm bored now"

 

FOUND FOUND FOUND

found found found found found found
someone who's worth it
in this murkiness
someone who's never
seeming scheming
found found found found found found
someone who's worth it
in this murkiness
someone who's never
seeming scheming
Oh, but if I'd never found
oh, but if I'd never found
oh, but if I'd never found
I do believe that
the more you give your love
and I do believe that
the more you offer trust
the more you chase
the more you cry
the more you're bound to lose
the more you're bound to lose
Oh, but if I'd never found
oh, but if I'd never found
somebody
who wants to be
who wants to be
with me
all the time

 

DRIVING YOUR GIRLFRIEND HOME

I'm driving
your girlfriend home
and she's saying
how she never chose you
"turn left", she says
so I turn left
and she says
"So how did I end up
so deeply involved in
the very existence
I planned on avoiding?"
and I can't answer
I'm driving
your girlfriend home
and she's laughing
to stop herself crying
"drive on", she says
so I drive on
and she says
"So how did I end up
attached to this person
when his sense of humour
gets gradually worser?"
and I can't tell her
I'm parking
outside her home
and we're shaking hands
goodnight, so politely

 

THE HARSH TRUTH OF THE CAMERA EYE

Churchillian legs
hair barely there
the harsh truth of the camera eye
Your eyes signal pain
because of the strain
of smiling
the harsh truth of the camera eye
telling you all
that you never wnated to know
showing what
you didn't want shown
My so friendly lens
zooms into
"the inner you"
and it tells the harsh truth
and nothing but
Laugh with us all here
that's if you can
then take the pictures home
and screamtelling you all
that you never wanted to know
showing you what
you didn't want shown
This photographer
he must have really had it in for you
"Oh, I don't want
to be judged anymore
I don't wnat to be judged
I would sooner be Loved
I would sooner be
just blindly Loved..."

 

(I'M) THE END OF THE FAMILY LINE

With no complications
fifteen generations
(of mine)
all honouring Nature
until I arrive
(with incredible style)
I'm the end fo the line
the end of the family line
the end of the line
No baby pulled screaming
out into this seething whirl
by chance or whim
(or even love?)
our family tree hacked into decline
and I'm spared the pain
of ever saying
("goodbye")
I'm the end of the line
the end of the family line
the end of the line

 

THERE'S A PLACE IN HELL FOR ME AND MY FRIENDS

There is a place
reserved
for me and my friends
and when we go
we all will go
so you see
I'm never alone
there is a place
with a bit more time
and a few more
gentler words
and looking back
we do forgive
(we had no choice
we always did)
all that we hope
is that when we go
our skin
and our blood
and our bones
don't get in your way
making you ill
the way they did
when we lived
There is a place
a place in hell
reserved
for me and my friends
and if ever I
wanted to cry
then I will
because I can

 

TONY THE PONY

Still drinking on the corner 
Just don't say I didn't warn you 
Always nagging big brother 
He's only looking out for you 
Tony The Pony 
Tony The Pony 
You're still standing on the corner 
Just don't say I didn't warn you 
Old and jealous big brother 
You had your time and you spent it 
Crying 
Now, Tony The Pony 
Tony The Pony 
So, that's what they call you now ? 
When you're free outside 
So cold and hard and in control 
And ... 
There's a free ride on 
Tony The Pony 
Oh, why do you always wanna stop me 
From doing the things in life that make me happy ? 
And when I'm outside with friends, laughing loudly 
Why do you always wanna stop me ? 
Oh, I would never 
I would never 
But you will carry the can for anyone 
The free ride on 
Gullible Tony 
You're drunker quicker 
And you're sicker even quicker 
For something heavy is gonna fall on you 
Oh ... 
And what do they call you now ? 
When you're free outside 
So cold and hard and in control 
And, oh ... been a lark 
There's a free ride on 
Fucked-up Tony 
I will never say I told you so 
Or how I knew that something bad 
Would happen to you 
I don't wanna say I told you so 
Oh, but Tony, I told you so !!! 
I told you so

 

YOU'RE GONNA NEED SOMEONE ON YOUR SIDE

With the world's fate 
Resting on your shoulder 
You're gonna need 
Someone on your side 
You can't do it by yourself 
Any longer 
You're gonna need 
Someone on your side 
Someone kindly told me 
That you'd wasted 
Eight of nine lives
Oh, give yourself a break 
Before you break down 
You're gonna need someone on your side 
And here I am, And here I am 
Well, you don't need 
To look so pleased ! 
Day or night, 
There is no difference 
You're gonna need someone on your side 
Day or night, 
There is no difference 
You're gonna need someone soon 
And here I am, And here I am 
Well, you don't need 
To look so pleased

 

GLAMOROUS GLUE

First day with the jar 
You find 
Everyone lies 
First day with the jar 
You find 
Everyone lies, nobody minds 
Everyone lies 
Where is the man you respect ? 
And where is the woman you love ? 
Where's the woman you love ? 
Third week with the jar
You find 
Everything dies 
We won't vote Conservative 
Because we never have 
Everyone lies, everyone lies 
Where is the man you respect ? 
And where is the woman you love ? 
Where's the woman you love ? 
Everything of worth 
On Earth Is there To share 
I used to dream, and I used to vow 
I wouldn't dream of it now 
We look to Los Angeles 
For the language we use 
London is dead, London is dead, London is dead...
Now I'm too much in love 
I'm too much in love 
I know 
I'll go 
Empty hand 
From the land

 

WE'LL LET YOU KNOW

How sad are we ? 
And how sad have we been ? 
We'll let you know 
We'll let you know 
Oh, but only if - you're really interested 
You wonder how 
We've stayed alive 'till now 
We'll let you know 
We'll let you know 
But only if - you're really interested 
We're all smiles 
Then, honest, I swear, it's the turnstiles 
That make us hostile 
Oh ... 
We will descend 
On anyone unable to defend 
Themselves 
Oh ... 
And the songs we sing 
They're not supposed to mean a thing 
La, la, la, la ... 
Oh ...You're lonely, Oh ... you're lonely, Oh ... 
GET OFF THE ROOF ! Oh ... 
Your Arsenal !
We may seem cold, or 
We may even be 
The most depressing people you've ever known 
At heart, what's left, we sadly know 
That we are the last truly British people you'll ever know 
We are the last truly British people you will ever know 
You'll never never want to know

 

THE NATIONAL FRONT DISCO

David, the wind blows 
The wind blows ... 
Bits of your life away 
Your friends all say ... 
"Where is our boy ? Oh, we've lost our boy" 
But they should know 
Where you've gone 
Because again and again you've explained that 
You're going to ... 
Oh, you're going to ... 
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah 
England for the English ! 
England for the English ! 
David, the winds blow 
The winds blow ...
All of my dreams away 
And I still say : 
"Where is our boy ? Ah, we've lost our boy" 
But I should know 
Why you've gone 
Because again and again you've explained
You've gone to the ... 
National, ah ... 
To the National .. 
There's a country; you don't live there 
But one day you would like to 
And if you show them what you're made of 
Oh, then you might do ... 
But David, we wonder 
We wonder if the thunder 
Is ever really gonna begin 
Begin, begin 
Your mom says : 
"I've lost my boy" 
But she should know 
Why you've gone 
Because again and again you've explained 
You've gone to the : 
National 
To the National 
To the National Front Disco 
Because you want the day to come sooner 
You want the day to come sooner 
You want the day to come sooner 
When you've settled the score 
Oh, the National 
Oh, the National

 

CERTAIN PEOPLE I KNOW

I take the cue from 
Certain people I know 
I use the cue 
And then I 
Hand it on to you 
And when I swing it 
So, it catches his eye ... 
(Weren't you there ? 
- You'd have died !) 
I trust the views of 
Certain people I know 
They look at Danger 
And they 
LAUGH THEIR HEADS OFF 
Their clothes are Imitation 
George the 23rd 
(Don't you find this absurd ?) 
I'd hate to be like 
Certain people I know 
They break their necks 
And can't afford to
Get them fixed 
Ah, they'd sacrifice all 
Of their principles for 
anything cashable 
I do believe it's terrible 
Oh, wo, wo, Ah, ah, ah, ah, Oh, wo, wo...

 

WE HATE IT WHEN OUR FRIENDS BECOME SUCCESSFUL

We hate it when our friends become successful 
We hate it when our friends become successful 
Oh, look at those clothes 
Now look at that face, it's so old 
And such a video ! 
Well, it's really laughable 
Ha, ha, ha ...
We hate it when our friends become successful 
And if they're Northern, that makes it even worse
And if we can destroy them 
You bet your life we will 
Destroy them 
If we can hurt them 
Well, we may as well ... 
It's really laughable 
Ha, ha, ha ... 
You see, it should've been me 
It could've been me 
Everybody knows 
Everybody says so 
They say : 
"Ah, you have loads of songs 
So many songs 
More songs than they'd stand 
Verse 
Chorus 
Middle eight 
Break, fade 
Just listen ..."
La, la-la, la-la

You're the One for me, fatty 
You're the One I really, really love 
And I will stay 
Promise you'll say 
If I'm ever in your ...

All over Battersea 
Some hope; and some despair 
All over Battersea 
Some hope; and some despair

SEASICK, YET STILL DOCKED

I am a poor freezingly cold soul 
So far from where 
I intended to go 
Scavenging through life's very constant lulls 
So far from where I'm determined to go 
Wish I knew the way to reach the one I love
There is no way ... 
Wish I had the charm to attract the one I love 
But you see, I've got no charm 
Mmm...
Tonight I've consumed much more than I can hold 
Oh, this is very clear to you 
And you can tell I have never really loved 
You can tell, by the way, I sleep all day
And all of my life no-one gave me anything 
No-one has ever given me anything 
My love is as sharp as a needle in your eye 
You must be such a fool 
To pass me by

 

I KNOW IT'S GONNA HAPPEN SOMEDAY

My love, wherever you are 
Whatever you are 
Don't lose faith 
I know it's gonna happen someday 
To you 
Please wait ... Please wait ... Oh ... Wait ... 
Don't lose faith 
You say that the day just never arrives 
And it's never seemed so far away 
Still, I know it's gonna happen someday 
To you 
Please wait ... 
Don't lose faith

 

TOMORROW

Tomorrow 
Will it really come ? 
And if it does come 
Will I still be Human ? 
All I ask of you is one thing that you never do 
Would you put your arms around me ? 
(I won't tell anyone) 
Tomorrow 
Does it have to come ?
All I ask of you is one thing that you'll never do 
Would you put your arms around me ? 
(I won't tell anybody) 
Tomorrow 
And what must come before ...
Oh, the pain in my arms 
Oh, the pain in my legs 
Ooh, my shiftless body 
Tomorrow 
It's surely nearer now ? 
You don't think I'll make it 
I never said I wanted to ! 
Well did I ? 
Oh, the pain in my arms 
Oh, the pain in my legs 
Oh, yeah; oh, yeah, No, yeah; no, yeah 
Through my shiftless body 
Tomorrow, Tomorrow 
All I ask of you ... oh ... 
Is : would you tell me that you love me 
Tell me, tell me that you love me, Tell me, tell me that you love me ... 
Ah, I know you don't mean it 
Ah, I know you don't mean it 
Tell me, tell me that you love me, Tell me, tell me that you love me ...

David, the winds blow 
The winds blow ...
All of my dreams away 
And I still say : 
"Where is our boy ? Ah, we've lost our boy" 
But I should know 
Why you've gone 
Because again and again you've explained
You've gone to the ... 
National, ah ... To the National .. 
There's a country; you don't live there 
But one day you would like to 
And if you show them what you're made of 
Oh, then you might do ... 
But David, we wonder 
We wonder if the thunder 
Is ever really gonna begin 
Begin, begin 
Your mom says : 
"I've lost my boy" 
But she should know 
Why you've gone 
Because again and again you've explained 
You've gone to the : 
National, To the National 
To the National Front Disco 
Because you want the day to come sooner 
You want the day to come sooner 
You want the day to come sooner 
When you've settled the score 
Oh, the National, Oh, the National…

 

NOVEMBER SPAWNED A MONSTER

Sleep on and dream of Love
because it's the closest you will get to love
poor twisted child, so ugly, so ugly
poor twisted child, oh hug me, oh hug me
one November spawned a monster 
in the shape of this child who later cried
"But Jesus made me, so Jesus save me from
pity, sympathy and people discussing me"
a frame of useless limbs what can make GOOD
all the BAD that's been done?
And if the lights were out
could you even bear
to kiss her full on the mouth (or anywhere?)
poor twisted child, so ugly, so ugly
poor twisted child, oh hug me, oh hug me
one November spawned a monster 
in the shape of this child who must remain
a hostage to kindess and the wheels underneath her
a hostage to kindess and the wheels underneath her
a symbol of where mad, mad lovers
must PAUSE and draw the line
So sleep and dream of love
because it's the closest
you will get to love
that November is a time which I must put OUT of my mind
oh one fine day 
LET IT BE SOON
she won't be rich or beautiful
but she'll be walking your streets
in the clothes that she went out
and chose for herself

 

SEASICK, YET STILL DOCKED

I am a poor freezingly cold soul 
So far from where 
I intended to go 
Scavenging through life's very constant lulls 
So far from where I'm determined to go 
Wish I knew the way to reach the one I love
There is no way ... 
Wish I had the charm to attract the one I love 
But you see, I've got no charm 
Mmm...
Tonight I've consumed much more than I can hold 
Oh, this is very clear to you 
And you can tell I have never really loved 
You can tell, by the way, I sleep all day
And all of my life no-one gave me anything 
No-one has ever given me anything 
My love is as sharp as a needle in your eye 
You must be such a fool 
To pass me by

 

THE LOOP

I just wanna say 
I haven't been away 
I'm still right here 
Where I always was 
So one day, if you're bored 
By all means call 
Because you can do 
(But only if you want to) 
I just wanna say 
I haven't been away 
I am still right here 
Where I always was 
So one day, when you're bored 
By all means call 
Because you can do 
But you might not get through

 

SISTER I'M A POET

All over this town 
Yes, a low wind may blow 
And I can see through everybo... 
With no reason 
To hide these words I feel 
And no reason 
To talk about the books I read 
But still I do 
That's 'cause I'm a ... Sister I'm a ... 
All over this town 
Along this way 
Outside the prison gates 
I love the romance of crime 
And I wonder 
Does anybody feel the way I do ? 
And is evil just something you are 
Or something you do ? 
Sister I'm a ... Sister I'm a ... 
All over this town, All over this town 
They pull over 
In their Citroen vans 
Not to shake your hand 
With meths on their breaths 
And you with youth on your side 
A plastic bag stranded at the lights 
This once was me ...
But now I'm a ... Sister I'm a ...
All over this town ... Oh, oh, oh 
All over this town, All over this town, Oh ... 
I still cannot speak French ... I am very lazy

 

JACK THE RIPPER

Oh, you look so tired 
Mouth slack and wide 
Ill-housed and ill-advised 
Your face is as mean 
As your life has been 
Crash into my arms 
I WANT YOU 
You don't agree -
But you don't refuse 
I know you 
And I know a place 
Where no one is likely to pass 
Oh, you don't care if it's late 
And you don't care if you're lost 
And oh, you look so tired 
(But tonight you presumed too much) 
Too much, too much 
And if it's the last 
Thing I ever do 
I'M GONNA GET YOU 
Crash into my arms 
I WANT YOU 
You don't agree -
But you don't refuse 
I know you 
And no one knows a thing about my life 
I can come and go as I please 
And if I want to, I can stay 
Oh, or if I want to, I can leave 
Nobody knows me, Nobody knows me, Nobody knows me Oh, oh...

 

SUCH A LITTLE THING MAKES SUCH A BIG DIFFERENCE

Such a little thing, such a little thing
but the difference it made was grave
there you go
wielding a bicycle chain
oh why won't you change
cange and be nicer?
such a little thing
a gentle tone of kindness
or written words on paper
- can you write?
How I love all of
the very simple things of life
(God's good air)
how I love all of
the very simple things of life
such a little thing
a fumbling politeness
the difference it saved me
wielding a bicycle chain
"I WILL NOT CHANGE AND I WILL NOT BE NICE"
Most people keep their brains between your legs (don't you find?)
Leave me alone - I was only singing, leave me alone because
I was only singing
leave me alone - I was only singing, leave me alone
you have just proved (again)
MOST PEOPLE KEEP THEIR BRAINS BETWEEN THEIR LEGS

 

I KNOW IT'S GONNA HAPPEN SOMEDAY

My love, wherever you are 
Whatever you are 
Don't lose faith 
I know it's gonna happen someday 
To you 
Please wait ... 
Please wait ... 
Oh ... Wait ... 
Don't lose faith 
You say that the day just never arrives 
And it's never seemed so far away 
Still, I know it's gonna happen someday 
To you 
Please wait ... 
Don't lose faith

 

WE'LL LET YOU KNOW

How sad are we ? 
And how sad have we been ? 
We'll let you know, We'll let you know 
Oh, but only if - you're really interested 
You wonder how 
We've stayed alive 'till now 
We'll let you know, We'll let you know 
But only if - you're really interested 
We're all smiles 
Then, honest, I swear, it's the turnstiles 
That make us hostile 
Oh ... We will descend 
On anyone unable to defend 
Themselves 
Oh ... And the songs we sing 
They're not supposed to mean a thing 
La, la, la, la ... Oh ...
You're lonely, Oh ... you're lonely 
Oh ... 
GET OFF THE ROOF !
Oh ... Your Arsenal !
We may seem cold, or 
We may even be 
The most depressing people you've ever known 
At heart, what's left, we sadly know 
That we are the last truly British people you'll ever know 
We are the last truly British people you will ever know 
You'll never never want to know

 

SUEDHEAD

Why do you come here
why do you hang around
I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry
Why do you come here
when you know it makes
things hard for me
when you know, oh
why do you come?
Why do you telephone?
and why send me silly notes?
I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry
why do you come here
when you know it makes
thing hard for me
when you know, oh
why do you come?
You had to sneak into my room
'just' to read my diary
was it just to see all the things
you knew I'd written about you?
and...so many illustrations
I'm so very sickened
oh, I am so sickened NOW

 

HE KNOWS I'D LOVE TO SEE HIM

He Knows (he knows)
Or, I think he does
because when I lived
in the Arse of the world...
he knows, he knows, he knows I'd love
to see him happy (or as close as is allowed)
because when I lived
in the Arse of the world
he knows, he knows, he knows I'd love
to see him happy (or as close as possible
as close as possible, as close as is allowed)
My name still conjours up deadly deeds
and a bad taste in the mouth
the police - they actually knew me
they said:
"You're just another person in the world
you're just another fool with radical views
you're just another who has maddening views
you want to turn it on its head
by staying in bed!"
I said: "I know I do"

 

YOU'RE GONNA NEED SOMEONE ON YOUR SIDE

With the world's fate 
Resting on your shoulder 
You're gonna need 
Someone on your side 
You can't do it by yourself 
Any longer 
You're gonna need 
Someone on your side 
Someone kindly told me 
That you'd wasted 
Eight of nine lives
Oh, give yourself a break 
Before you break down 
You're gonna need someone on your side 
And here I am, And here I am 
Well, you don't need 
To look so pleased ! 
Day or night, 
There is no difference 
You're gonna need someone on your side 
Day or night, 
There is no difference 
You're gonna need someone soon 
And here I am, And here I am 
Well, you don't need 
To look so pleased

 

GLAMOROUS GLUE

First day with the jar 
You find 
Everyone lies 
First day with the jar 
You find 
Everyone lies, nobody minds, Everyone lies 
Where is the man you respect ? 
And where is the woman you love ? 
Where's the woman you love ? 
Third week with the jar
You find 
Everything dies 
We won't vote Conservative 
Because we never have 
Everyone lies, everyone lies 
Where is the man you respect ? 
And where is the woman you love ? 
Where's the woman you love ? 
Everything of worth 
On Earth, Is there, To share 
I used to dream, and I used to vow 
I wouldn't dream of it now 
We look to Los Angeles 
For the language we use 
London is dead, London is dead, London is dead, ...
Now I'm too much in love 
I'm too much in love, 
I know I'll go 
Empty hand 
From the land

 

WE HATE IT WHEN OUR FRIENDS BECOME SUCCESSFUL

We hate it when our friends become successful 
We hate it when our friends become successful 
Oh, look at those clothes 
Now look at that face, it's so old 
And such a video ! 
Well, it's really laughable 
Ha, ha, ha ...
We hate it when our friends become successful 
And if they're Northern, that makes it even worse
And if we can destroy them 
You bet your life we will 
Destroy them 
If we can hurt them 
Well, we may as well ... 
It's really laughable 
Ha, ha, ha ... 
You see, it should've been me 
It could've been me 
Everybody knows 
Everybody says so 
They say : 
"Ah, you have loads of songs 
So many songs 
More songs than they'd stand 
Verse 
Chorus 
Middle eight 
Break, fade 
Just listen ..."
La, la-la, la-la

 

NOW MY HEART IS FULL

There's gonna be some trouble 
A whole house will need re-building 
And everyone I love in the house 
Will recline on an analyst's couch quite 
Soon 
Your Father cracks a joke 
And in the usual way 
Empties the room 
Tell all of my friends 
(I don't have too many 
Just some rain-coated lovers' puny brothers)
Dallow, Spicer, Pinkie, Cubitt 
Rush to danger 
Wind up nowhere 
Patric Doonan - raised to wait 
I'm tired again, I've tried again, and 
Now my heart is full 
Now my heart is full 
And I just can't explain 
So I won't even try to
Dallow, Spicer, Pinkie, Cubitt 
Every jammy Stressford poet 
Loafing oafs in all-night chemists 
Loafing oafs in all-night chemists 
Underact - express depression 
Ah, but Bunnie I loved you 
I was tired again 
I've tried again, and 
Now my heart is full 
Now my heart is full 
And I just can't explain 
So I won't even try to 
Could you pass by ? 
Could you pass by ? 
Oh ... 
Now my heart is full 
Now my heart is full 
And I just can't explain 
So ... slow ... 
Slow ... slow ... slow ... slow ... slow ...

 

SPRING-HEELED JIM

Spring-heeled Jim winks an eye 
He'll "do", he'll never be "done to" 
He takes on whoever flew through 
"Well, it's the normal thing to do" ... ah ... 
Spring-heeled Jim lives to love 
Now kissing with his mouth full 
And his eyes on some other fool 
So many women 
His head should be spinning 
Ah, but no ! 
Ah, but no ! 
But no !
Ah, no !
Spring-heeled Jim slurs the words : 
"There's no need to be so knowing
Take life at five times the 
Average speed, like I do" 
Until Jim feels the chill 
"Oh, where did all the time go ?" 
Once always in for the kill 
Now it's too cold 
And he feels too 
old 
Too old
Mmm, old... 
La, la, la, la-la, la ...

 

BILLY BUDD

Say, Billy Budd 
So you think you should ? 
Oh, everyone's laughing 
Say, Billy Budd 
So you think that you should ? 
Everyone's laughing ! 
Since I took up with you 
Things have been bad 
Yeah, but now it's 12 years on 
Now it's 12 years on 
Yes, and I took up with you 
I took my job application 
Into town 
Did you hear ? They turned me down 
Yes, and it's all because of us 
Oh, and what was in our eyes 
Oh, what was in our eyes, yeah 
I said, Billy Budd 
I would happily lose 
Both of my legs 
I would lose both of my legs 
Oh, if it meant you could be free 
Oh, if it meant you could be free 
(Don't leave us in the dark!)

 

HOLD ON TO YOUR FRIENDS

A bond of trust 
Has been abused 
Something of value 
May be lost 
Give up your job 
Squander your cash - be rash 
Just hold on to your friends 
There are more than enough 
To fight and oppose 
Why waste good time 
Fighting the people you like 
Who will fall defending your name 
Oh, don't feel so ashamed 
To have friends 
But now you only call me 
When you're feeling depressed 
When you feel happy I'm 
So far from your mind 
My patience is stretched 
My loyalty vexed 
Oh, you're losing all of your friends 
Hold on to your friends 
Hold on to your friends 
Resist - or move on 
Be mad, be rash 
Smoke and explode 
Sell all of your clothes 
Just bear in mind : 
Oh, there just might come a time 
When you need some friends

 

THE MORE YOU IGNORE ME, THE CLOSER I GET

The more you ignore me 
The closer I get 
You're wasting your time 
The more you ignore me 
The closer I get 
You're wasting your time 
I will be 
In the bar 
With my head 
On the bar 
I am now 
A central part 
Of your mind's landscape 
Whether you care 
Or do not 
Yeah, I've made up your mind 
The more you ignore me 
The closer I get 
You're wasting your time 
The more you ignore me 
The closer I get 
You're wasting your time 
Beware !
I bear more grudges 
Than lonely high court judges 
When you sleep 
I will creep 
Into your thoughts 
Like a bad debt 
That you can't pay 
Take the easy way 
And give in 
Yeah, and let me in 
Oh, let me in 
Oh let me ... 
Oh, let me in 
IT'S WAR 
IT'S WAR 
WAR 
WAR 
Oh, let me in 
Ah, the closer I get 
Ah, you're asking for it 
Ah, the closer I get 
Ooh, the closer I ...

 

WHY DON'T YOU FIND OUT FOR YOURSELF

The sanest days are mad 
Why don't you find out for yourself ? 
Then you'll see the price 
Very closely 
Some men here 
They have a special interest 
In your career 
They wanna help you to grow 
And then syphon all your dough 
Why don't you find out for yourself ? 
Then you'll see the glass 
Hidden in the grass 
You'll never believe me, so 
Why don't you find out for yourself ? 
Sick down to my heart 
That's just the way it goes 
Some men here 
They know the full extent of 
Your distress 
They kneel and pray 
And they say : 
"Long may it last" 
Why don't you find out for yourself ?
Then you'll see the glass 
Hidden in the grass 
Bad scenes come and go 
For which you must allow 
Sick down to my heart 
That's just the way it goes 
Don't rake up my mistakes 
I know exactly what they are 
And ... what do YOU do ? 
Well ... you just SIT THERE 
I've been stabbed in the back 
So many many times 
I don't have any skin 
But that's just the way it goes

 

I AM HATED FOR LOVING

I am hated for loving 
I am hated for loving 
Anonymous call, a poison pen 
A brick in the small of the back again 
I still don't belong 
To anyone - I am mine 
And I am hated for loving 
I am haunted for wanting 
Anonymous call, a poison pen 
A brick in the ... ah ... 
A brick in the small of the back again 
I still don't belong 
To anyone - I am mine 
I am falling 
With no-one to catch me 
I am falling 
And there's still 
No-one to catch me 
Ah .. 
Anonymous call, a poison pen 
A brick in the ... ah ... 
A brick in the small of the back again 
I just don't belong 
To anywhere 
I just don't belong 
Mmm ... 
Ah ...

 

LIFEGUARD SLEEPING, GIRL DROWNING

Always looking for attention 
Always needs to be mentioned 
Who does she 
Think she should be ? 
The shrill cry through darkening air 
Doesn't she know he's 
Had such a busy day ? 
Tell her ... sshhh
Somebody tell her ... sshhh 
Slowest ... 
It was only a test 
But she swam too far 
Against the tide 
She deserves all she gets 
The sky became marked with stars 
As an out-stretched arm slowly 
Disappears 
Hooray 
Oh hooray 
No, oh, oh, woh, there's no movement 
No, oh, hooray 
Oh, hooray 
Please don't worry 
There'll be no fuss 
She was ... nobody's nothing 
(What's your name ?) 
When he awoke 
The sea was calm 
And another day passes like a dream 
There's no ... no way 
(What's your name ?)

 

USED TO BE A SWEET BOY

Used to be a sweet boy 
Holding so tightly 
To Daddy's hand 
But that was all 
In some distant land 
Blazer and tie 
And a big bright healthy smile 
Used to make all 
Of our trials worthwhile 
Used to be a sweet boy 
And I'm not to blame 
Something went wrong 
And I know 
I'm not to blame 
Something went wrong 
Can't be to blame 
Ah ...

 

THE LAZY SUNBATHERS

A world war 
Was announced 
Days ago 
But they didn't know 
The lazy sunbathers 
The lazy sunbathers 
The sun burns through 
To the planet's core 
And it isn't enough 
They want more 
Nothing 
Appears 
To be 
Between the ears of 
The lazy sunbathers 
Too jaded 
To question stagnation 
The sun burns through 
To the planet's core 
And it isn't enough 
They want more 
Religions fall 
Children shelled 
"...Children shelled ? That's all 
Very well, but would you 
Please keep the noise 
Down low ? 
Because you're waking 
The lazy sunbathers ..."
Oh, the lazy sunbathers 
The lazy sunbathers

 

SPEEDWAY

And when you slam 
Down the hammer 
Can you see it in your heart ? 
All of the rumours 
Keeping me grounded 
I never said, I never said that they were 
Completely unfounded 
So when you slam 
Down the hammer 
Can you see it in your heart ? 
Can you delve so low ? 
And when you're standing 
On my fingers 
Can you see it in your heart ? ... ah ... 
And when you try 
To break my spirit 
It won't work 
Because there's nothing left to break 
Anymore 
All of the rumours 
Keeping me grounded 
I never said, I never said that they were 
Completely unfounded 
You won't sleep 
Until the earth that wants me 
Finally has me 
Oh you've done it now 
You won't rest 
Until the hearse that becomes me 
Finally takes me 
Oh you've done it now 
And you won't smile 
Until my loving mouth 
Is shut good and proper 
FOREVER 
All of the rumours 
Keeping me grounded 
I never said, I never said that they were 
Completely unfounded 
And all those lies 
Written lies, twisted lies 
Well, they weren't lies 
They weren't lies 
They weren't lies 
I never said 
I never said 
I could have mentioned your name 
I could have dragged you in 
Guilt by implication 
By association 
I've always been true to you 
In my own strange way 
I've always been true to you 
In my own sick way 
I'll always stay true to you

 

THE TEACHERS ARE AFRAID OF THE PUPILS

There's too many people 
Planning your downfall 
When your spirit's on trial 
These nights can be frightening 
Sleep transports sadness 
To some other mid-brain 
And somebody here 
Will not be here next year 
So you stand by the board 
Full of fear and intention 
And, if you think that they're listening 
Well, you've got to be joking 
Oh, you understand change 
And you think it's essential 
But when your profession 
Is humiliation 
Say the wrong word to our children ...
We'll have you, oh yes, we'll have you 
Lay a hand on our children 
And it's never too late to have you 
Mucus on your collar 
A nail up through the staff chair 
A blade in your soap 
And you cry into your pillow 
To be finished would be a relief 
To be finished would be a relief... 
Say the wrong word to our children ...
We'll have you, oh yes, we'll have you 
Lay a hand on our children 
And it's never too late to have you 
To be finished would be a relief 
To be finished would be a relief...
I'm very glad this thing has come 
Sometimes I'm so glad 
Never bother to play the tunes 
I've seen it coming for dear life

 

READER MEET AUTHOR

You don't know a thing about their lives 
They live where you wouldn't dare to drive
You shake as you think of how they sleep 
But you write as if you are my side-by-side 
Reader, meet Author 
With the hope of hearing sense 
But you may be feeling let down 
By the words of defence 
He says : "No-one ever sees me when I cry"
You don't know a thing about their lives 
Books don't save them, books aren't Stanley knives 
And if a fight broke out here tonight 
You'd be the first away, because you're that type 
And the Year 2000 won't change anyone here 
As each fabled promise flies so fast 
You'll swear it was never there 
Oh, have you ever escaped from a shipwrecked life ? 
So safely with your software; all miles from the front line 
You hear the way their sad voices, and you start to imagine things 
Oh, any excuse to write more lies

 

THE BOY RACER

He's just too good-natured and 
He's got too much money and 
He's got too many girlfriends

And I'm gonna ... kill him !
Oh, no ! Oh, no ! Oh, no ! Oh, no ! Oh, no !Oh ....

THE OPERATION

You fight with your right hand 
And caress with your left hand 
Everyone I know is sick to death of you 
With a tear that's a mile wide 
In the kite that you're flying 
Everyone I know is sick to death of you 
Ever since 
You don't look the same 
You're just not the same, no way 
You say clever things and 
You never used to 
You don't catch what I'm saying 
When you're deafened to advice 
Everyone here is sick to the 
Back teeth of you 
With a tear that's a mile wide 
In the kite that you're flying 
Everyone here is sick to the 
Tattoo of you 
Ever since 
You don't look the same 
You're just not the same, no way 
You say pleasant things and 
There is no need to
Still, you fight with your right hand 
And caress with your left hand 
Ooh, ooh ... Sad to say ... 
How once I was in love with you 
Sad to say ... 
You don't catch what I'm saying 
When you're deafened to advice 
Ooh, ooh ... Ever since 
You don't look the same 
You're just not the same, no way 
What the hell have 
They stuck into you ?

 

DAGENHAM DAVE

Head in the clouds, and a mouthful of pie 
Head in a blouse, everybody loves him 
I see why 
Dagenham Dave, Dagenham Dave, Oh, Dagenham Dave 
Dagenham Dave, Dagenham Dave, Oh, Dagenham Dave 
"I love Karen, I love Sharon" on the windowscreen 
With never the need to fight or to question a single thing 
Dagenham Dave, Dagenham Dave Oh, Dagenham Dave 
Dagenham Dave, Dagenham Dave Oh, Dagenham Dave ...
He'd love to touch, he's afraid that he might self-combust 
I could say more, but you get the general idea 
Dagenham Dave, Dagenham Dave Dagenham Dave, Dagenham Dave 
Dagenham, Dagenham Dagenham Dave, Dagenham Dave ...
Oh, Dave, oh, Dagenham, dagenham, Oh, Dave, oh, Dave, ...

 

DO YOUR BEST AND DON'T WORRY

Compare the best of their days 
With the worst of your days 
You won't win 
With your standards so high 
And your spirits so low 
At least remember ... 
This is you on a bad day, you on a pale day 
Just do your best and don't ... Don't worry, oh 
The way you hang yourself is oh, so unfair 
See the best of how they look 
Against the worst of how you are
And again, you won't win 
With your standards so high 
And your spirits so low 
At least remember ... 
This is you on a drab day, you in a drab dress 
Just do your best and don't ... Don't worry, oh 
The way you hang yourself is oh, so unfair 
Just do your best and don't ... Don't worry, oh 
The way you watch yourself is oh, so unfair 
Just do your best and don't ... Don't worry, oh 
Do your best and don't ...

 

BEST FRIEND ON THE PAYROLL

I turn the music down; and I don't know why, this is my house 
I turn the music down; and I don't know why, this is my house 
The best friend on the payroll 
No, no, no, it's not gonna work out 
It's not gonna work out, No, no, no, no 
The best friend on the payroll 
Oh, no, no, no, it's not gonna work out 
It's not gonna work out 
More breakfast in bed, and I'll bring the paper in later
The best friend on the payroll

SOUTHPAW

You were a boy before you became a man 
I don't see the joy 
And you ran with your pals in the sun 
You turned around and they were gone 
Again ... 
A sick boy should be treated 
So easily defeated 
Oh, I just don't understand 
So you ran with your pals in the sun 
You turned around 
You were alone 
Again ... 
And you ran back to Ma 
Which set the pace for the rest of your days 
Oh, you ran back to Ma 
Which set the pace for the rest of your days 
Oh, you ran back to Ma 
Which set the pace for the rest of your days 
And now, there is something that you should know 
There is something that you should know 
The girl of your dreams is 
Here all alone 
Girl of your dreams is 
Here all alone 
The girl of your dreams is 
Sad and all alone 
The girl of your dreams is 
Here all alone 
There is something that you should know 
There is something that you should know 
Girl of your dreams is 
Here all alone 
The girl of your dreams is 
Sad and is all alone 
The girl of your dreams is 
Sad and is feeling all alone 
Oh, there is something that you should know 
Help me, help me, help me ...

 

MALADJUSTED

I wanna start from 
Before the beginning 
Loot wine, "Be mine, and 
Then let's stay out for the night"
Ride via Parkside 
Semi-perilous lives 
Jeer the lights in the windows 
Of all safe and stable homes 
(But wondering then, well what 
Could peace of mind be like ?)
Anyway do you want to hear 
Our story, or not ? 
As the Fulham Road lights 
Stretch and invite into the night 
From a Stevenage overspill 
We'd kill to live around 
SW6 - with someone like you 
Keep thieves' hours 
With someone like you 
...As long as it slides 
You stalk the house 
In a low-cut blouse : 
"Oh Christ, another stifled 
Friday night !"
And the Fulham Road lights 
Stretch and invite into the night 
Well, I was fifteen 
What could I know ?
When the gulf between 
All the things I need 
And the things I receive 
Is an ancient ocean 
Wide, wild, lost, uncrossed 
Still I maintain there's nothing 
Wrong with you 
You do all that you do 
Because it's all you can do 
Well, I was fifteen 
Where could I go ?
With a soul full of loathing 
For stinging bureaucracy 
Making it anything 
Other than easy 
For working girls like me 
With my hands on my head 
I flop on your bed 
With a head full of dread 
For all I've ever said 
Maladjusted, maladjusted 
Maladjusted maladjusted 
Never to be trusted 
Oh, never to be trusted 
There's nothing wrong with you, oh 
...There's nothing wrong with you

 

ALMA MATTERS

So : the choice I have made 
May seem strange to you 
But who asked you, anyway ? 
It's my life to wreck 
My own way 
You see : to someone, somewhere, oh yeah ... 
Alma matters 
In mind, body and soul 
In part, and in whole 
Because to someone, somewhere, oh yeah ... 
Alma matters 
In mind, body and soul 
In part, and in whole 
So the life I have made 
May seem wrong to you 
But, I've never been surer 
It's my life to ruin 
My own way 
You see : to someone, somewhere, oh yeah ... 
Alma matters 
In mind, body and soul 
In part, and in whole 
Because to someone, somewhere, oh yeah ... 
Alma matters 
In mind, body and soul 
In part, and in whole 
To someone, somewhere, oh yeah ... 
Alma matters 
In mind, body and soul 
Part, and in whole 
So to someone, somewhere, oh yeah ... 
Alma matters 
In mind, body and soul 
Part, and in whole 
To someone, somewhere, oh yeah ... 
Oh yeah ... Oh yeah, oh yeah Oh yeah ...

 

AMBITIOUS OUTSIDERS

Bolt-lock your doors 
Alarm your cars 
And still we move in closer 
Every day 
Top of the list 
Is your smiling kids 
But we'll be smiling too 
So that's OK 
Oh, and by the way 
Thank you, because you're 
Giving, giving, giving 
And we're receiving - 
No, no, we're taking 
Keeping the population down 
Your taxes paid, but 
Police waylaid 
And we knows 
When the school bus 
Comes and goes 
We're on your street, but 
You don't see us 
Or, if you do 
You smile and say Hello 
BUT DON'T UNDERESTIMATE US 
When you are 
Giving, giving, giving 
And we're receiving - 
No, no, we're taking 
Just keeping 
The population down 
You're giving, giving, giving 
Well, it's your own fault 
For reproducing 
We're just keeping 
The population down

 

TROUBLE LOVES ME

Trouble loves me 
Trouble needs me 
Two things 
More than you do 
Or would attempt to 
So, console me 
Otherwise, hold me 
Just when it seems like 
Everything's evened out 
And the balance 
Seems serene 
Trouble loves me 
Walks beside me 
To chide me 
Not to guide me 
It's still much more 
Than you'll do 
So, console me 
Otherwise, hold me 
Just when it seems like 
Everything's evened out 
And the balance seems serene 
See the fool I'll be 
Still running 'round 
On the flesh rampage 
Still running 'round 
Ready with ready-wit 
Still running 'round 
On the flesh rampage 
- At your age ! 
Go to Soho, oh 
Go to waste in 
The wrong arms 
Still running 'round 
Trouble loves me 
Seeks and finds me 
To charlatanize me 
Which is only 
As it should be 
Oh, please fulfill me 
Otherwise, kill me 
Show me a barrel and watch me scrape it 
Faced with the music, as always I'll face it 
In the half-light 
So English, frowning 
Then at midnight I 
Can't get you out of my head 
A disenchanted taste 
Still running 'round 
A disenchanted taste 
Still running 'round

 

PAPA JACK

Papa Jack 
Wants to turn 
Back the clock 
And reach out 
To the kids 
He once had 
Who have flown 
Papa Jack 
In decline 
Feels inclined 
To reach out 
To the kids 
He once had 
Who have flown 
But there was a time 
When the kids reached up 
And Papa Jack just 
Pushed them away 
Looking deep 
In his heart 
Papa Jack 
Doesn't like 
What he sees 
Or the time 
On his hands 
The dying day 
The chilly sun 
Papa Jack 
All alone 
Sings slow 
Grieving and low 
But there was a time 
When the kids reached up 
Now you can't always 
Have it your way 
Papa Jack 
Ah ...

 

AMMUNITION

I know these roads 
Each ridge 
And narrow bridge 
Each cheveron 
Enticing me on 
Each warning sign 
I take in my stride 
I don't need more ammunition 
I've got more than I can spend 
I don't dwell on things I'm missing 
I'm just pleased 
With the things I've found 
I know these roads 
An old hand understands 
Above all, I know what's 
Expected of me now 
Veering cliffwards 
I don't need more ammunition 
I've got more than I can spend 
I don't dwell on things I'm missing 
I'm just pleased 
With the things I've found 
With the things I've found 
With the things I've found 
I've found 
I've been crying 
It comes back on these salient days 
And it stays 
And it says : 
"We've never really been away" 
I don't need more ammunition 
I've got more than I can spend 
I don't think of who I'm missing 
I've got no space and no time 
In my life, anymore 
No space or time 
In my life, anymore 
For Revenge

 

WIDE TO RECEIVE

Download something 
Useful, or useless 
Because I'm lying here 
Wide to receive 
Almost anything 
You'd care to give 
And I don't 
Get along with myself 
And I'm not too keen 
On anyone else 
Turn on, plug in 
Then just walk away 
Unlock, process 
And then just go 
And I've never felt quite so alone 
As I do right now 
I'm lying here 
Wide to receive 
Almost anything 
You'd care to leave 
Wide, wide, wide Wide, wide, wide...

 

ROY'S KEEN

(GO ON !)
He's romancing you 
And chancing his arm 
He'll be here 
Smiling on time 
He's romancing you 
And chancing his arm 
He'll be here 
Smiling on time 
Roy's keen oh Roy's keen 
Roy's keen oh Roy's keen 
We've never seen a 
Keener window-cleaner 
Back up the ladder 
Into each corner 
Dunking the chamois 
Just think of the goodwill 
The ladder's a planet 
Roy is a star, and 
I am a satellite 
(But that's alright) 
He can hold a smile for as long 
As you require (even longer) 
He can hold a smile for as long 
As you require (even longer) 
Roy's keen oh Roy's keen 
Roy's keen oh Roy's keen 
We've never seen a 
Keener window-cleaner 
Back up the ladder 
Into each corner 
Dunking the chamois 
Just think of the goodwill 
The ladder's a planet 
Roy is a star, and 
I am a satellite 
I will be set alight 
Don't say you'll hold it steady 
Then you let it go 
Don't say you'll hold it steady 
Then you let it go Oh ...
You're up the ladder 
Into each corner 
Foot in a bucket 
We trust you to wreck it 
Even when it's under your nose 
Well, you just can't 
See it, can you ? 
Well, it's here 
Right under your nose 
And you just can't 
See it, can you? La la la la ...
Roy's keen, Roy's keen La la la la ...
We've never seen a 
Keener window-cleaner 
Oh ... La la la la ...

 

HE CRIED

I need you 
Simple words 
But words which had never been heard 
By the soul 
Stoned to death 
But still living 
And so he froze where he stood 
And he looked to the ground 
And he cried 
He cried 
Ride our minds 
If you must 
But there's always a line you don't cross 
Time is short 
Don't be cruel 
Oh you don't know the power 
In what you're saying 
Oh ... 
And so he froze where he stood 
And he looked to the ground 
And he cried 
He cried 
People where 
I come from 
They survive without feelings or blood 
I never could 
Was stoned to death 
But I'm still living 
So he froze where he stood 
And he looked to the ground 
And he cried 
He cried 
So he froze 
And he looked, and he looked 
To the ground 
And he cried 
He cried

 

SORROW WILL COME IN THE END

Legalized theft 
Leaves me bereft 
I get it straight in the neck 
(Somehow expecting no less) 
A court of justice 
With no use for Truth 
Lawyer ...liar 
Lawyer ...liar 
You pleaded and squealed 
And you think you've won 
But Sorrow will come 
To you in the end 
And as sure as my words are pure 
I praise the day that brings you pain 
Q.C.'s obsessed with sleaze 
Frantic for Fame 
They're all on the game 
They just use a different name 
You lied 
And you were believed 
By a J.P. senile and vile 
You pleaded and squealed 
And you think you've won 
But Sorrow will come 
To you in the end 
And as sure as my words are pure 
I praise the day that brings you pain 
So don't close your eyes 
Don't close your eyes 
A man who slits throats 
Has time on his hands 
And I'm gonna get you 
So don't close your eyes 
Don't ever close your eyes 
You think you've won 
OH NO

 

SATAN REJECTED MY SOUL

Satan rejected my soul 
He knows my kind 
He won't be dragged down 
He's seen my face around 
He knows Heaven doesn't seem 
To be my home 
So I must find 
Somewhere else to go 
So I must find 
Somewhere else to go 
So, take it - please 
It's free 
You'll never see 
You'll never see 
All the fun in life it's cost me 
Satan rejected my soul 
As low as he goes 
He never quite goes this low 
He's seen my face around 
He knows Heaven doesn't seem 
To be my home 
So I must find 
Somewhere else to go 
So I must find 
Somewhere else to go 
So, take it please 
It's really sly 
Come on, come on, ah Come on, come on, come on 
Take it please, It's really sly 
Come on, come on, ah Come on, come on, come on 
Call me in, Pull me in, call me in 
Come on, come on, oh Come on, come on, come on 
Pull me in, pull me in, Call me in, haul me in, pull me in 
Come on, come on, ah, Come on, come on 
La la la la la, Oh ...

 
 REEL AROUND THE FOUNTAIN

It's time the tale was told
of how you took a child
and you made him old
Reel around the fountain
slap me on the patio
I'll take it now
Fifteen minutes with you
well, I wouldn't say no
people said that you were virtually dead
and they were so wrong
fifteen minutes with you
well, i wouldn't say no
people said that you were easily led
and they were half-right
I dreamt about you last night
and i fell out of bed twice
you can pin and mount me like a butterfly
but take me to the haven of your bed
was something that you never said
two lumps, please
you're the bee's knees
but so am I
Meet me at the fountain
shove me on the patio
I'll take it slowly
Fifteen minutes with you
oh I wouldn't say no
people see no worth in you
oh but I do

 

YOU'VE GOT EVERYTHING NOW

As merry as the days were long
I was right and you were wrong
back at the old grey school
I would win and you would lose
But you've got everything now
and what a terrible mess I've made of my life
No, I've never had a job
because I've never wanted one
I've seen you smile
but I've never really heard you laugh
So who is rich and who is poor?
I cannot say...
You are your mother's only son
and you're a desperate one
But I don't want a lover
I just want to be seen in the back of your car
A friendship sadly lost?
Well, this is true ...and yet, it's false
Did I ever tell you , by the way
I never did like your face
But you've got everything now
and what a terrible mess I've made of my life
No, I've never had a job
because I'm too shy
But I don't want a lover
I just want to be tied to the back of your car.

 

MISERABLE LIE

So, goodbye
please stay with your own kind
and I'll stay with mine
There's something against us
it's not time
So, goodbye
I know I hardly say
how much I love your casual way
but please put your tongue away
a little higher and we're well away
the dark nights are drawing in
and your humour is as black as them
I look at yours, you laugh at mine
and"love" is just a miserable lie
you have destroyed my flower like-life
not once-but twice
you have corrupt my innocent mind
not once-but twice
I know that wind-swept mystical air
it means: I'd like to see your underwear
I recognise that mystical air
it means: I'd like to see your underwear
what do we get for the trouble and pain?
just a rented room in Whalley Range
into the depths of the criminal world
I followed her...
I need advice, I need advice
because nobody ever looks at me twice
I'm just a country-mile behind
the world
I'm just a country mile behind
the whole world
so take me when you go

 

PRETTY GIRLS MAKE GRAVES

Upon the sand,upon the bay
"there is a quick and easy way" you say
before you illustrate
I'd rather state:
"I'm not the man you think I am
I'm not the man you think I am "
And Sorrow's native son
he will not smile for anyone
And pretty girls makes the graves
End of the pier, end of the bay
you tug my arm and say:"Give into lust,
give up to lust, oh heaven knows we'll
soon be dust..."
But I'm not the man you think I am
I'm not the man you think I am
And Sorrow's native son
he will not rise for anyone
And pretty girls make graves
I could have been wild and I could have been free
but Nature played this trick on me
She wants it Now
and she will not wait
but she's too rough
and I'm too delicate
Then on the sand
another man, he takes her hand
and a smile lights up her stupid face
(and well, it would)
I lost my faith in Womanhood
I lost my faith in Womanhood, I lost my faith

 

THE HAND THAT ROCKS THE CRADLE

Please don't cry
the ghost and the storm outside
will not invade this sacred shire
nor infiltrate your mind
my life down I shall lie
if the bogey-man should try
to play tricks on your sacred mind
to tease, torment and tantalise
wavering shadows loom
a piano plays in an empty room
there'll be blood on the cleaver tonight
when darkness lifts and the room is bright
I'll still be by your side
for you are all that matters
and I'll love you till the day I die
there never need to be longing in your eyes
as long as the hand that rocks the cradle is mine
ceiling shadows shimmy by
and when the wardrobe towers like a beast of prey
there's a sadness in your beautiful eyes
you're untouched, unsoiled, wonderous eyes
my life down I shall lie
should restless spirts try
to play tricks on you sacred mind
but whom I never gave a name
I just looked into his wonderous eyes
and said" never never never again"
all too soon I did return
just like a moth to a flame
so rattle my bones all over the stones
because I'm only a beggar-man whom nobody owns
see how words as old as sin
fit me like a glove I'm here and here I'll stay
together we lie, together we pray
there never need be longing in your eyes
as long as the hand that rocks the cradle is mine

 

STILL ILL

I decree today that life
is simply taking and not giving
England is mine and it owes me a living
ask me why, and I'll spit in your eye
ask me why, and I'll spit in your eye
but we cannot cling to the old dreams anymore
no, we cannot cling to the old dreams anymore
Does the body rule the mind
or does the mind rule the body?
I dunno...
Under the iron bridge we kissed
and although I ended up with sore lips
it just wasn't like the old days anymore
no, it wasn't like those days
am I still ill?
Does the body rule the mind
or does the mind rule the body ?
I dunno...
Ask me why, and I'll die
ask me why, and I'll die
and if you must go to work tomorrow
well, if I were you I wouldn't bother
for there are brighter sides to life
and I should know because I've seen them
but not very often...
under the iron bridge we kissed
and although I ended up with sore lips
it just wasn't like the old days anymore
no, it wasn't like those days
am I still ill?

 

HAND IN GLOVE

Hand in glove
the sun shines out of our behinds
no, it's not like any other love
this one is different-because it's us
Hand in glove
we can go wherever we please
and everything depends upon
how near you stand to me
And if the people stare
then the people stare
I really don't know and I really don't care
Hand in glove
the Good People laugh
yes, we may be hidden by rags
but we have something they'll never have
So, hand in glove I stake my claim
I'll fight to the last breath
If they dare touch a hair on your head
I'll fight to the last breath
The Good Life is out there, somewhere
so stay on my arm, you little charmer
But I know my luck too well
and I'll probably never see you again.

 

WHAT DIFFERENCE DOES IT MAKE?

All men have secrets and here is mine
so let it be known
we have been through hell and high tide,
I can surely rely on you?
and yet you start to recoil,
heavy words are so lightly thrown
but still I'd leap in front of a flying bullet for you
So, what difference does it make?
so, what difference does it make?
it makes none
but you have gone
and you must be looking very old tonight
The devil will find work for idle hands to do
I stole and I lied, and why?
because you asked me to!
but now you make feel so ashamed
because I've only got two hands
well, I'm still fond of you
So, what difference does it make?
so, what difference does it make?
it makes none
but you have gone
and your prejudice won't keep you warm tonight
So, no more apologies
no more apologies
I'm too tired
I'm too sick and tired
and I'm feeling very sick and ill today
But I'm still fond of you

 

I DON'T OWE YOU ANYTHING

Bought on stolen wine
a nod was the first step
you know very well
what was coming next
did I really walk all this way
just to hear you say
"oh I don't want to go out tonight"
but you will
for you must
I don't owe you anything
but you owe me something
repay me now
you should never go to them
let them come to you
just like I do
you should not go to them
let them come to you
just like I do
Too freely on your lips
words prematurely said
oh but I know what will make you smile tonight
Life is never kind
life is never kind
oh but I know what will make you smile tonight

 

SUFFER LITTLE CHILDREN

Over the moors,take me to the moors
dig a shallow grave
and I'll lay me down
Lesley-Anne, with your pretty white beads
oh John, you'll never be a man
and you'll never see your home again
oh Manchester, so much to answer for
Edward, see those alluring lights?
tonight will be your very last night
a woman said "I know my son is dead
I'll never rest my hands on his scared head"
Hindley wakes and Hindley says:
"Wherever he has gone, I have gone "
But fresh lilaced moorland fields
cannot hide the stoild stench of death
Hindley wakes and Hindley says:
"Whatever he has done, I have done"
But this is no easy ride
for a child cries
"find me...find me, nothing more
we're on a sullen misty moor
we may be dead and we may be gone
but we will be right by your side
until the day you die
this is no easy ride
we will haunt you when you laugh
yes, you could say we're a team
you might sleep
BUT YOU WILL NEVER DREAM!"
Oh Manchester, so much to answer for
Oh Manchester, so much to answer for

THE HEADMASTER RITUAL

Belligerent ghouls
run Manchester schools
spineless swines
cemented mines
Sir leads the troops
jealous of youth
same old suit since 1962
he does the military two-step
down the nape of my neck
I wanna go home
I don't want to stay
give up education
is a bad mistake
mid-week on the playing fields
Sir thwacks you on the knees
knees you in the groin
elbow in the face
I wanna go home
I don't want to stay
Belligerent ghouls
run Manchester schools
spineless bastards all
Sir leads the troops
jealous of youth
same old jokes since 1902
he does the military two-step
down the nape of my neck
I wanna go home
I don't want to stay
give up life
as a bad mistake
please excuse me from gym
I've got this terrible cold coming on
he grabs and devours
he kicks me in the showers
kicks me in the showers
and he grabs and devours
I wanna go home
I don't want to stay

 

RUSHOLME RUFFIANS

The last night at the fair
by the big wheel generator
a boy is stabbed
and his money is grabbed
and the air hangs heavy like a dulling wine
she is famous
she is funny
an engagement ring
doesn't mean a thing
to a mind consumed by brass(money)
and though I walk home alone
my faith in love is still devout
the last night at the fair
from a seat on a whirling waltzer
her skirt ascends for a watching eye
it's a hideous trait( on her mother's side)
and though I walk home alone
my faith in love is still devout
then someone falls in love
and someone's beaten up
and the senses being dulled are mine

this is the last night of the fair
and the grease in the hair
of a speedway operator
is all a tremulous heart requires
a schoolgirl is denied
she said "How quickly would I die
if I jumped from the top of the parachutes?"

I WANT THE ONE I CAN'T HAVE

On the day that your mentality
catches up with your biology
I want the one I can't have
and it's driving me mad
it's written all over my face
A double-bed
and a stalwart lover, for sure
these are the riches of the poor
A double-bed
and a stalwart lover, for sure
these are the riches of the poor
a tough kid who sometimes swallows nails
raised on Prisoner's Aid
he killed a policeman when he was thirteen
and somehow that really impressed me
it's written all over my face
On the day that your mentality
catches up with your biology
And if you ever need self-validation
just meet me in the alley by the
railway-station
it's written all over my face

 

WHAT SHE SAID

What she said:
"How come someone hasn't noticed
that I'm dead
and decided to bury me
God knows, I'm ready"
What she said was
but then, all the rejection she's had
to pretend to be happy
could only be idiocy
What she said was not for the job or
lover that she never had
What she read
all heady books
she'd sit and prophesise
(it took a tattoed boy from Birkenhead
to really really open her eyes)

THAT JOKE ISN'T FUNNY ANYMORE

Park the car at the side of the road
you should know
time's tide will smother you
and I will too
when you laugh about other people who feel so
very lonely
their only desire is to die
well I'm afraid
it doesn't make me smile
I wish I could laugh
but that joke isn't funny anymore
it's too close to home and it's too near the bone
it's too close to home and it's too near the bone
more than you'll ever know
It was dark as I drove the point home
and on cold leather seats
well, it suddenly struck me
I just might die with a smile on my
face after all
I've seen this happen in other people's lives
and now it's happening in mine

 

NOWHERE FAST

I'd like to drop my trousers to the world
I am a man of means(of slender means)
each household appliance
is like a new science in my town
and if a day came when I felt a natural emotion
I'd get such a shock I'd probably jump in the ocean
and when a train goes by
it's such a sad sound
I'd like to drop my trousers to the Queen
every sensible child will know what this means
the poor and the needy
are selfish and greedy on her terms
and if the day came when I felt a natural emotion
I'd get such a shock I'd probably jump in the ocean
and when a train goes by
it's such a sad song
And when I'm lying in my bed
I think about life
and I think about death
and neither one particularly appeals to me
and if the day came when I felt a natural emotion
I'd get such a shock I'd probably lie
in the middle of the street and die
I'd lie down and die

 

WELL I WONDER

Well I wonder
do you hear me when you sleep?
I hoarsely cry
Well I wonder
do you see me when we pass?
I half-die
Please keep me in mind
please keep me in mind
Gasping-but somehow still alive
this is the fierce last stand of all I am
Gasping-dying-but somehow still alive
this is the final stand of all I am
Please keep me in mind

 

BARBARISM BEGINS AT HOME

Unruly boys
who will not grow up
must be taken in hand
Unruly girls
who will not settle down
they must be taken in hand
A crack on the head
is what you get for not asking
and a crack on the head
is what you get for asking

 

MEAT IS MURDER

Heifer whines could be human cries
closer comes the screaming knife
this beautiful creature must die
this beautiful creature must die
a death for no reason
and death for reason is MURDER
and the flesh you so fancifully fry
is not succulent, tasty or nice
it's death for no reason
and death for no reason is MURDER
and the calf that you carve with a smile
is MURDER
and the turkey you festively slice
is MURDER
do you know how animals die?
kitchen aroma aren't very homely
it's not "comforting," "cheery" or kind
it's sizzling blood and the unholy stench
of MURDER
it's not "natural," "normal" or kind
the fleas you so fancifully fry
as you savour the flavour
of MURDER
NO, NO, NO, IT'S MURDER
NO, NO, NO, IT'S MURDER
who hears when animals cry?

 

THE QUEEN IS DEAD

Farewell to this lands cheerless marches
hemmed in like a boar between arches
her very Lowness with her head in a sling
Im truely sorry-but it sounds like a wonderful thing
dear Charles, dont you ever crave
to appear on the front of the Daily mail
dressed in your Mother's bridal veil?
So, I checked all the registered historical facts
and I was shocked into shame to discover
how Im the 18th pale descendent
of some, old queen or other
has the world changed, or have I changed?
has the world changed, or have I changed?
as some 9-year old tough peddles drugs
(I never even knew what drugs were)
And so, I broke into the Palace
with a sponge and a rusty spanner
she said: "Eh, I know you, and you cannot sing"
I said: "that's nothing -you should hear me play piano"
We can go for a walk where it's quiet and dry
and we can talk about precious things
but when you are tied to your mother's apron
not one talks about castration
We can go for a walk where it's quiet and dry
and we can talk about precious things
like love and law and poverty
these are the things that kill me
We can go for a walk where it's quiet and dry
and we can talk about precious things
but the rain that flattens my hair
theses are the things that kill me
Passed the Pub that saps your body
and the church who'll snatch your money
the Queen is dead, boys
and it's so lonely on a limb
Pass the Pub that wrecks your body
and the church-all they want is your money
the Queen is dead, boys`
you can trust me, boys
life is very long, when you're lonely
life is very long, when you're lonely...

 

FRANKLY MR.SHANKLY

Frankly, Mr Shankly, this position Ive held
it pays my way, but it corrodes my soul
I want to leave you will not miss me
I want to go down in musical history
Frankly, Mr Shankly, Im a sickening wreck
Ive got the 21st Century breathing down my neck
I must move fast, you understand me
I want to go down in celluloid history
Fame, Fame, fatal Fame
it can play hideous tricks on the brain
but still I rather be Famous
than righteous or holy, any day
but sometimes Id feel more fulfilled
making Christmas cards with the mentally ill
I want to Live and I want to Love
I want to catch something that I might be ashamed of
Frankly, Mr Shankly, this position I've held
it pays my way and it corrodes my soul
oh, I didnt realise that you wrote poetry
(I didnt realise you wrote such bloody awful poetry)
Frankly, Mr Shankly, since you ask
you are a flatulent pain the arse
I do not mean to be so rude
but still, I must speck frankly, Mr Shankly

 

I KNOW IT'S ALL OVER

Oh Mother, I can fell the soil falling over my head
and as i climb into an empty bed
Oh well, Enough said
I know it's over-still I cling
I don't know where else I can go
Oh Mother, I can feel the soil falling over my head
see, the sea want s to take me
the knife wants to cut me
do you think you can help me?
Sad veiled bride, please be happy
handsome groom, give her room
loud, loutish lover, treat her kindly
(although she needs you
more than she loves you)
and I know it's over
and it never really began
but in my heart it was so real
and you even spoke to me and said:
"If you're so funny
then why are you on your own tonight?
and if you are so clever
then why are you on your own tonight?
if you're so terribly good looking
then why do you sleep alone tonight?
because tonight is just like any other night
that's why you're on your own tonight
with your triumphs and your charms
while they are in each other's arms.."
It's so easy to laugh
it's so easy to hate
it takes strength to be gentle and kind
It's so easy to laugh
it's so easy to hate
it takes guts to be gentle and kind
love is Natural and Real
but not for you, my love
not tonight my love
love is Natural and Real
but not for such as you and I, my love
Oh Mother, I can fell the soil falling over my head
Oh Mother, I can fell the soil falling over my head...

 

NEVER HAD NO ONE EVER

When you walk without ease
on these
the very streets where you were raised
I had a really bad dream
it lasted 20 years, 7 months, and 27 days
Never had no one ever.

 

CEMETERY GATES

A dreaded sunny day
so I meet you at the cemetry gates
Keats and Yeats are on your side
A dreaded sunny day
so I meet you at the cemetry gates
Keats and Yeats are on your side
while Wilde is on mine
So we go inside and we gravely read the stones
all those people all those lives
where are they now ?
with loves, and hates
and passions just like mine
they were born
and then they lived and then they died
which seems so unfair
and I wantr to crv
You say: "ere thrice the sun hath done salutation to the dawn"
and you claim these words as your own
but Im well-read, have heard them said
a hundred times (maybe less, maybe more)
if you must write prose/poems
the words you use should be your own
dont plagiarise or take "on loans"
there's alweays someone, somewhere
with a big nose, who knows
and who trips you up and laughs
when you fall
You say: "ere long done do does did "
words which could only be your own
you then produce the text
from whence was ripped
(some dizzy whore, 1804)
A dreaded sunny day
so let's go where we're happy
so I meet you at the cemetry gates
Keats and Yeats are on your side
A dreaded sunny day
so let's go where we're wanted
so I meet you at the cemetry gates
Keats and Yeats are on your side
but you lose
because Wilde is on mine

 

BIGMOUTH STRIKES AGAIN

Sweetness, sweetness I was only joking
when I said Id like to smash every tooth
in your head
Sweetness, sweetness I was only joking
when I said by right s you should be
bludgeoned in your bed
and now I know how Joan of Arc felt
now I know how Joan of Arc felt
as the flames roseto her roman nose
and her Walkman stared to melt
Bibmouth, bigmouth
bigmouth strikes again
and Ive got no right to take my place
with the Human race
and now I know how Joan of Arc felt
now I know of Joan of Arc felt
as the flames rose to her roman nose
and her hearing aid started to melt
Bigmouth, bigmouth
bigmouth strikes again
and Ive got no right to take my place

THE BOY WITH A THORN IN HIS SIDE

The boy with the thorn in his side
behind the hatred there lies
a murderous desire for love
how can they look into my eyes
and still they dont believe me
how can they hear me say those words
and still they dont believe me
and if they don't believe me now
will they ever believe me?
and if they don't believe me now
will they ever believe me?
The boy with the thorn in his side
behind the hatred there lies
a plundering desire for love
how can they see the Love in our eyes
and still they don't believe us
and after all this time
they don't want to believe us
and if they dont believe us now
will they ever believe us ?
andd when you want to Live
how do you start ?
where do you go ?
who do you know?

 

VICAR IN A TUTU

I was minding mind business
lifting some lead off
the roof of the Holy Name church
it was worthwhile living a laughable life
just to set my eyes on a blistering sight
of a vicar in a tu-tu
he's not strange
he just wants to live his life this way
a scanty bit of a thing
with a decorative ring
that wouldn't cover the head of a child
as Rose collects the money in the cannister
who comes sliding down the bannister
the vicar in a tu-tu
he's not strange
he just wants to live his life this way
the monkish monsignor
with a head full of plaster
said "my man, get your vile soul dry-cleaned"
as Rose counts the money in the cannister
as natural as rain
he dances again
vicar in a tu-tu
The next day in the pulpit
with Freedom and Ease
combating ignoranca,dust and disease
as Rose counts the money in the cannister
as natural as rain
he dances again
the fabric of a tu-tu
any man could get us to
and I am a living sign.

 

THERE IS A LIGHT THAT NEVER GOES OUT

Take me out tonight
where there's music and there's people
who are young and alive
driving in your car
I never never want to go home
because I havent got one
anymore
take me out tonight
because I want to see people and I
want to see lights
driving in your car
oh please dont drop me home
because it's not my home, it's their
home, and Im welcome no morw
and if a double-decker bus
crashes in to us
to die by your side
such a heavenly way to die
and if a ten ton truck
kills the both of us
to die by your side
the pleasure and the privilege is mine
take me out tonight
oh take me anywhere, I dont care
and in the darken underpass
I thought Oh God, my chance has come at last
(but then a strange fear gripped me and I just couldn't ask)
take me out tonight
take me anywhere, I dont care
just driving in your car
I never never want to go home
because I havent got one
I havent got one.

 

SOME GIRLS ARE BIGGER THAN OTHERS

From the ice-age to the dole-age
there is but one concern
and I have just discover
some girls are bigger than others
some girls are bigger than others
some girls mothers are bigger than
other girls mothers
As Anthony said to Cleopatra
as he opened a crate of ale:
some girls are bigger than others
some girls are bigger than others
some girls mothers are bigger than
other girls mothers.

 

A RUSH AND A PUSH AND AND THE LAND IS OURS

HELLO
I am the ghost of Troubled Joe
hung by his pretty white neck
some eighteen months ago
I travelled to a mystical time zone
but I missed my bed
so I soon came home
they said:
"there's too much caffeine
in your bloodstream
and a lack of real spice
in your life"
I said:
"leave me alone
because I'm alright, dad
just surprised to still
be on my own...."
Ooh, but don't mention love
I'd hate the real strain of the pain again
a rush and a push and the land that
we stand on is ours
it has been before
so it shall be again
and people who are uglier than you and I
they take what they need, and leave
Ooh, but don't mention love
I'd hate the pain and the strain all over again
a rush and a push and the land that
we stand on is ours
it has been before
so why can't it be now?
and people who are weaker than you and I
they take what they want from life
Ooh, but don't mention love
no - just don't mention love!
a rush and a push and the land that
we stand on is ours
your youth may be gone
but you're still a young man
so phone me, phone me, phone me
so phone me, phone me, phone me
Ooh, I think I'm in love...
Urrgh, I think I'm in lerv

 

I STARTED SOMETHING I COULDN'T FINISH

The lanes were silent
with nothing or no one around for miles
I doused our friendly venture
with a hard-faced
three-word gesture
I started something
I forced you into a zone
and you were clearly
never meant to go
hair brushed and parted
typical me, typical me, typical me
I started something
...and now I'm not too sure
I grabbed you by the guilded beams
that's what Tradition means
and I doused another venture
with a gesture
that was...absolutely vile
I started something
forced you to a zone
and you were clearly
never meant to go
hair brushed and parted
typical me, typical me, typical me
I started something
...and now I'm not too sure
I grabbed you by the guilded beams
that's what Tradition means
and now eighteen months' hard-labour
seems...fair enough

DEATH OF A DISCO DANCER

The death of a disco dancer
well, it happens a lot 'round here
and if you think Peace
is a common goal
well, that goes to show
just how little you know
The death of a disco dancer
well, I'd rather not get involved
I never talk to my neighbour
I'd just rather not get involved
Love, peace and harmony?
Love, peace and harmony?
Oh, very nice, very nice, very nice, very nice
...but maybe in the next world.

 

GIRLFRIEND IN A COMA

Girlfriend in a coma, I know
I know - it's serious
Girlfriend in a coma, I know
I know - it's really serious
there wree times when I could
have 'murdered' her
(but, you know, I would hate
anything to happen to her)
NO, I DON'T WANT TO SEE HER
Do you really think
she'll pull through?

STOP ME IF YOU'VE HEARD THIS ONE BEFORE

Stop me, stop me,
stop me if you think that you've heard this one before
stop me, stop me
stop me if you think that you've heard this one before
nothing's changed
I still love you, oh I still love you
...only slightly less than I used to
I was delayed, I was way-laid
an emergency stop
I smelt the last ten seconds of life
I crashed down on the crossbar
and the pain was enough to make
a shy, bald buddhist reflect
and plan a mass-murder
who said I'd lied to her?
who said I'd lied because I never
who said I'd lied because I never
I was detained, I was restrained
he broke my spleen
he broke my knees
(and then he really laid into me)
Friday night in Out-patients
who said I'd lied to her?
who said I'd lied - because I never
who said I'd lied - because I never
Oh, so I drank one
or was it four
and when I fell on the floor
...I drank more
stop me, stop me
stop me if you think that you've heard this one before
nothing's changed
I still love you, I still love you
but only slightly
less than I used to

 

LAST NIGHT I DREAMT THAT SOMEBODY LOVED ME

Last night I dreamt
that somebody loved me
no hope - but no harm
just another false alarm
Las night I felt
real arms around me
no hope - no harm
just another false alarm
so, tell me how long
before the last one?
and tell me how long
before the right one?
this story is old - I KNOW
but it goes on
this story is old - I KNOW
but it goes on

 

UNHAPPY BIRTHDAY

I've come to wish you an unhappy birthday
I've come to wish you an unhappy birthday
because you're evil
and you lie
and if you should die
I may feel slightly sad
(but I won't cry)
Loved and lost
and some may say
when usually its Nothing
surely you're happy
it should be this way?
I say "No, I'm gonna kill my dog"
and: "May the lines sag heavy
and deep tonight XXX"

PAINT A VULGAR PICTURE

At the record company meeting
On their hands - a dead star
and ooh, the plans that they weave
and ooh, the sikening greed
At the record company meeting
on their hands - a dead star
the sycophantic slags all say:
"I knew him first, and I knew him well"
Re-issue! Re-package! Re-package!
Re-evaluate the songs
double-pack with a photograph
Extra Track (and a tacky badge)
A-list, playlist
"Please them, please them!"
"Please them! Please them!"
(sadly, THIS was your life)
but you could have said no
if you'd wanted to
you could have said no
if you'd wanted to
BPI, MTV, BBC
"Please them! Please them!"
(sadly this was your life)
but you could have said no
if you'd wanted to
you could have walked away
...couldn't you?
I touched you at the soundcheck
you had no real way of knowing
in my heart I bgged "please, take
me with you...
I don't care where you're going"
But to you I was faceless
I was fawning, I was boring
just a child from those ugly new houses
who could never begin to know
who could never really know
Best of? Most of?
Satiate the need
slip them into different sleeves!
Buy both, and be decieved
climber - new entry, re-entry
World tour! ("media whore")
"Please the Press in Belgium!"
(THIS was your life...)
and when it fails to recoup?
Well, maybe:
You just haven't earned it yet, baby
I walked a pace behind you at the soundcheck
you're just the same as I am
what makes most people feel happy
leads us headlong into harm
so, in my bedroom in those 'ugly new houses'
I dance my legs down to the knees
but me and my 'true love'
we will never meet again...
At the record company meeting
on their hands - at last! - a dead star!
but they cannot taint you in my eyes
no, they cannout touch you now
No, they cannot hurt you my darling
they cannot touch you now
but me and my 'true love'
will never meet again

 

DEATH AT ONE'S ELBOW

Ooh Glenn, don't come to the house tonight
Ooh, Glenn, don't come to the house tonight
because there's somebody here
who really really loves you
stay home
be bored
(it's crap, I KNOW)
Ooh, Glenn, don't come to the house tonight
Ooh, Glen, don't come to the house tonight
because there's somebody here
who'll take a hatchet to your ear
how the frustration renders me
hateful, Glenn!
don't come to the house tonight
don't come to the house tonight
because you'll slip on the
trail of my bespattered remains
and so, that's why
GOODBYE MY LOVE, GOODBYE MY LOVE, GOODBYE MY LOVE...
Belch

 

I WON'T SHARE YOU

I won't share you
I won't share you
with the drive and ambition
and the zeal I feel
this is my time
as the note I wrote
was read, she said
has the Perrier gone
straight to my head
or is life plainly sick and cruel, instead?
"YES!"
No-no-no-no-no-no
I won't share you
I won't share you
with the drive and the dreams inside
this is my time
Life tends to come and go
well, that's OK
just as long as you know
Life tends to come and go
well, that's OK
just as long as you know
I won't share you
I won't share you
with the drive and the dreams inside
this is my time, this is my time


THE QUEEN IS DEAD

Farewell to this lands cheerless marches
hemmed in like a boar between arches
her very Lowness with her head in a sling
Im truely sorry-but it sounds like a wonderful thing
dear Charles, dont you ever crave
to appear on the front of the Daily mail
dressed in your Mother's bridal veil?
So, I checked all the registered historical facts
and I was shocked into shame to discover
how Im the 18th pale descendent
of some, old queen or other
has the world changed, or have I changed?
has the world changed, or have I changed?
as some 9-year old tough peddles drugs
(I never even knew what drugs were)
And so, I broke into the Palace
with a sponge and a rusty spanner
she said: "Eh, I know you, and you cannot sing"
I said: "that's nothing -you should hear me play piano"
We can go for a walk where it's quiet and dry
and we can talk about precious things
but when you are tied to your mother's apron
not one talks about castration
We can go for a walk where it's quiet and dry
and we can talk about precious things
like love and law and poverty
these are the things that kill me
We can go for a walk where it's quiet and dry
and we can talk about precious things
but the rain that flattens my hair
theses are the things that kill me
Passed the Pub that saps your body
and the church who'll snatch your money
the Queen is dead, boys
and it's so lonely on a limb
Pass the Pub that wrecks your body
and the church-all they want is your money
the Queen is dead, boys`
you can trust me, boys
life is very long, when you're lonely
life is very long, when you're lonely...

 

PANIC

Panic on the streets of London
Panic on the streets of Birmingham
I wonder to myself
Could life ever be sane again
on the Leeds side-streets that you slip down
I wonder to myself
Hopes may rise on the Grasmeres
But Honey Pie, you're not safe here
So you run down
To the safety of the town
But there's Panic on the streets of Carlisle
Dublin, Dundee, Humberside
I wonder to myself
Burn down the Disco
Hang the blessed D.J.
Because the music that they constantly play
IT SAYS NOTHING TO ME ABOUT MY LIFE
Hang the blessed D.J.
Because the music they constantly play
On the Leeds side-streets that you slip down
On the provincial towns that you jog 'round
Hang the D.J.,. Hang the D.J.,.Hang the D.J...

 

VICAR IN A TUTU

I was minding mind business
lifting some lead off
the roof of the Holy Name church
it was worthwhile living a laughable life
just to set my eyes on a blistering sight
of a vicar in a tu-tu
he's not strange
he just wants to live his life this way
a scanty bit of a thing
with a decorative ring
that wouldn't cover the head of a child
as Rose collects the money in the cannister
who comes sliding down the bannister
the vicar in a tu-tu
he's not strange
he just wants to live his life this way
the monkish monsignor
with a head full of plaster
said "my man, get your vile soul dry-cleaned"
as Rose counts the money in the cannister
as natural as rain
he dances again
vicar in a tu-tu
The next day in the pulpit
with Freedom and Ease
combating ignoranca,dust and disease
as Rose counts the money in the cannister
as natural as rain
he dances again
the fabric of a tu-tu
any man could get us to
and I am a living sign.

 

ASK

Shyness is nice, but
Shyness can stop you
From doing all the things in life
That you'd like to
So, if there's something you'd like to try
ASK ME-I WON'T SAY "NO"-HOW COULD I?
Coyness is nice, but ,
Coyness can stop you
from saying all the things in
life that you want to
If there's something that you'd like to try
ASK ME-I WON'TSAY"NO"-HOW COULD I?
Spending warm, Summer days indoors
Writing fringhtening verse
To a buck-toothed girl in Luxembourg
ASK ME, ASK ME ,ASK ME, ASK ME, ASK ME ,ASK ME
Because if it's not Love
Then it's the Bomb
That will bring us together
Nature is a language-can't you read?
Nature is a language-can't you read?
ASK ME, ASK ME ,ASK ME, ASK ME, ASK ME ,ASK ME
Because if it's not Love
Then it's the Bomb
That will bring us together

 

MARIE'S THE NAME (HIS LATEST FLAME) / RUSHOLME RUFFIANS

Very old friend 
Came by today 
As he was telling everyone in town 
Of all the love that he'd just found 
And Marie's the name (of his latest flame) 
Talked and talked 
And I heard him say 
That she had the longest blackest hair 
Prettiest green eyes anywhere 
And Marie's the name (of his latest flame) 
The last night of the fair 
By the big wheel generator 
A boy is stabbed 
His money is grabbed 
And the air hangs heavy like a dulling wine 
She is Famous 
She is Funny 
An engagement ring 
Doesn't mean a thing 
To a mind consumed by brass (money), oh 
The last night of the fair 
From a seat on a whirling waltzer 
Her skirt ascends for a watching eye 
It's a hideous trait (on her mother's side)
From a seat on a whirling waltzer 
Her skirt ascends for a watching eye 
A hideous trait (on her mother's side) 
Then someone falls in love 
Someone's beaten up 
Someone's beaten up 
And the senses being dulled are mine 
And someone falls in love 
Someone's beaten up 
And the senses being dulled are mine 
This is the last night of the fair 
And the grease in the hair 
Of a speedway operator 
Is all a tremulous heart requires 
A schoolgirl is denied 
She said : "How quickly would I die 
If I jumped from the top of the parachutes ?"
This is the last night of the fair 
And the grease in the hair 
Of a speedway operator 
Is all a tremulous heart requires 
A schoolgirl is denied 
She said : "How quickly would I die 
Oh, if I jumped from the top of the parachutes ?"
...Oh, walk home alone 
I might walk home alone 
But my faith in love is still devout

 

THE BOY WITH THE THORN IN HIS SIDE

The boy with the thorn in his side
behind the hatred there lies
a murderous desire for love
how can they look into my eyes
and still they dont believe me
how can they hear me say those words
and still they dont believe me
and if they don't believe me now
will they ever believe me?
and if they don't believe me now
will they ever believe me?
The boy with the thorn in his side
behind the hatred there lies
a plundering desire for love
how can they see the Love in our eyes
and still they don't believe us
and after all this time
they don't want to believe us
and if they dont believe us now
will they ever believe us ?
andd when you want to Live
how do you start ?
where do you go ?
who do you know?

 

RUBBER RING / WHAT SHE SAID

Yeah! What she says : 
"How come someone hasn't noticed 
That I'm dead 
And decided to bury me ? 
God knows, I'm ready !"
La-la-la ... 
What she said was sad 
But then, all the rejection she's had 
To pretend to be happy 
Could only be idiocy 
La-la-la ... 
What she said was not for the job or 
Lover that she never had 
No no no ... 
What she read 
All heady books 
She'd sit and prophesise 
(It took a tattooed boy from 
Birkenhead 
To really really open her eyes)

IS IT REALLY SO STRANGE?

I left the North 
I travelled South 
I found a tiny house 
And I can't help the way I feel 
Oh yes, you can kick me 
And you can punch me 
And you can break my face 
But you won't change the way I feel 
'Cause I love you, Oh ... 
And is it really so strange ? 
Oh, is it really so strange ? 
Oh, is it really so, really so strange ? 
I say NO, you say YES 
(and you will change your mind) 
I left the South 
I travelled North 
I got confused - I killed a horse 
I can't help the way I feel 
Oh yes, you can punch me 
And you can butt me 
And you can break my spine 
But you won't change the way I feel 
'Cause I love you, Oh ... 
And is it really so strange ? 
Oh, is it really so strange ? 
Oh, is it really so, really so strange ? 
I say NO, you say YES 
(But you will change your mind) 
I left the North again 
I travelled South again 
And I got confused - I killed a nun 
I CAN'T HELP THE WAY I FEEL 
(I lost my bag in Newport Pagnell) 
Why is the last mile the hardest mile ? 
My throat was dry, with the sun in my eyes 
And I realised, I realised 
I could never 
I could never, never, never, go back home again

 

CEMETERY GATES

A dreaded sunny day
so I meet you at the cemetry gates
Keats and Yeats are on your side
A dreaded sunny day
so I meet you at the cemetry gates
Keats and Yeats are on your side
while Wilde is on mine
So we go inside and we gravely read the stones
all those people all those lives
where are they now ?
with loves, and hates
and passions just like mine
they were born
and then they lived and then they died
which seems so unfair
and I wantr to crv
You say: "ere thrice the sun hath done salutation to the dawn"
and you claim these words as your own
but Im well-read, have heard them said
a hundred times (maybe less, maybe more)
if you must write prose/poems
the words you use should be your own
dont plagiarise or take "on loans"
there's alweays someone, somewhere
with a big nose, who knows
and who trips you up and laughs
when you fall
You say: "ere long done do does did "
words which could only be your own
you then produce the text
from whence was ripped
(some dizzy whore, 1804)
A dreaded sunny day
so let's go where we're happy
so I meet you at the cemetry gates
Keats and Yeats are on your side
A dreaded sunny day
so let's go where we're wanted
so I meet you at the cemetry gates
Keats and Yeats are on your side
but you lose
because Wilde is on mine

 

LONDON

Smoke
Lingers 'round your fingers
Train
Heave on - to Euston
Do you think you've made
The right decision this time?
You left
Your tired family grieving
And you think they're sad because you're leaving
But didn't you see the Jealousy in the eyes
Of the ones who had to stay behind?
And do you think you've made
The right decision thins time?
You left
Your girlfriend on the platform
With thei really ragged notion that you'll return
But she knows
That when he goes
He really goes
So do you think you've made
The right decision this time?

 

I KNOW IT'S OVER

I can feel the soil falling over my head 
And as I climb into an empty bed 
Oh well. Enough said. 
I know it's over - still I cling 
I don't know where else I can go 
Over ... 
Oh Mother, I can feel the soil falling over my head 
See, the sea wants to take me 
The knife wants to cut me 
Do you think you can help me ? 
Sad veiled bride, please be happy 
Handsome groom, give her room 
Loud, loutish lover, treat her kindly 
(Though she needs you 
More than she loves you) 
And I know it's over - still I cling 
I don't know where else I can go 
Over, it's over, it's over, it's over 
It's over, la ... 
I know it's over 
And it never really began 
But in my heart it was so real
And you even spoke to me, and said : 
"If you're so funny 
Then why are you on your own tonight ? 
And if you're so clever 
Then why are you on your own tonight ? 
I know ... 
'Cause tonight - it's just like any other night 
That's why you're on your own tonight 
Your triumphs and your charms 
While they're in each other's arms..."
It's so easy to laugh 
It's so easy to hate 
It takes strength to be gentle and kind 
Over, over, over, over 
It's so easy to laugh 
It's so easy to hate 
It takes guts to be gentle and kind 
Over, over 
Love is Natural and Real 
But not for you, my love 
Not tonight, my love 
Love is Natural and Real 
But not for such as you and I, my love 
Oh Mother, I can feel the soil falling over my head...
Oh Mother, I can feel the soil fall over, fall over my head 
Oh Mother, I can feel the ... fall over my ... , Oh ...

 

THE DRAIZE TRAIN

A vastly superior version of the instrumental B-side, acting as a peace 
offering to Marr (Morrissey chose the tracks for the compilation, 
and of course, receives no royalties on this track).

 

STILL ILL

I decree today that life
is simply taking and not giving
England is mine and it owes me a living
ask me why, and I'll spit in your eye
ask me why, and I'll spit in your eye
but we cannot cling to the old dreams anymore
no, we cannot cling to the old dreams anymore
Does the body rule the mind
or does the mind rule the body?
I dunno...
Under the iron bridge we kissed
and although I ended up with sore lips
it just wasn't like the old days anymore
no, it wasn't like those days
am I still ill?
Does the body rule the mind
or does the mind rule the body ?
I dunno...
Ask me why, and I'll die
ask me why, and I'll die
and if you must go to work tomorrow
well, if I were you I wouldn't bother
for there are brighter sides to life
and I should know because I've seen them
but not very often...
under the iron bridge we kissed
and although I ended up with sore lips
it just wasn't like the old days anymore
no, it wasn't like those days
am I still ill?

 

BIGMOUTH STRIKES AGAIN

Sweetness, sweetness I was only joking
when I said Id like to smash every tooth
in your head
Sweetness, sweetness I was only joking
when I said by right s you should be
bludgeoned in your bed
and now I know how Joan of Arc felt
now I know how Joan of Arc felt
as the flames roseto her roman nose
and her Walkman stared to melt
Bibmouth, bigmouth
bigmouth strikes again
and Ive got no right to take my place
with the Human race
and now I know how Joan of Arc felt
now I know of Joan of Arc felt
as the flames rose to her roman nose
and her hearing aid started to melt
Bigmouth, bigmouth
bigmouth strikes again
and Ive got no right to take my place
with the Human race

 
ALSATIAN COUSTIN

Were you and he Lovers?
and would you say so if you were?
on a forecourt
on a Friday
passing my way
Were you and he Lovers?
and if you were, then say that you were!
on a groundsheet
under canvas
with your tent-flap
open wide
A note upon his desk:
"P.S. Bring Me Home And Have Me!"
Leather elbows on a tweed coat
- Oh! -
Is THAT the best you can do?
So came his reply:
"...but on the desk is where I want you!"
So I ask (even though I know):
were you and he Lovers?

 

LITTLE MAN, WHAT NOW?

An afternoon nostalgia
television show
you spoke in silhouette
(but they couldn't name you)
although the panel were
very polite to you
but I remembered you
from Friday nights 1969
ATV - you murdered every line
too old to be a child star
too young to take leads
four seasons passed
and they AXED you
nervously juvenile
(WON'T SMILE!)
What became of you?
did that swift eclipse torture you?
a star at eighteen
and then-suddenly gone
down to a few lines
in the back page of a teenage annual
oh but I remembered you
I looked up to you

 

EVERYDAY IS LIKE SUNDAY

Trudging slowly over wet sand
back to the bench
where your clothes were stolen
this is the coastal town
that they forgot to close down
Armageddon - come Armageddon!
Come Armageddon! Come!
Everyday is like Sunday
everyday is silent and grey
Hide on the promenade
scratch out a postcard
"how I dearly with I was not here"
in the seaside town
...that they forgot to bomb
Come! Come! Come - nuclear bomb!
Everyday is like Sunday
everyday is silent and grey
Trudging back over pebbles and sand
and a strange dust lands on your hands
(and on your face)
Everyday is like Sunday
"Win Yourself A Cheap Tray"
share some greased tea with me
everyday is silent and grey

 

BENGALI IN PLATFORMS

No no no
he does not want to depress you
oh no no no no no
he only wants to impress you
Bengali in platform
she only wants to embrace your culture
and to be your friend forever
Bengali, Bengali
oh shelve your Western plans
and understand that life is hard enough when you belong here
A silver-studded rim that glistens
and an ankle-star that...blinds me
a lemon sole so very high
which only reminds me, to tell you
so I break the news gently
I break the news to you gently
"Shelve your plans"
Bengali, Bengali
its the touchy march of time
that blinds you
don't blame me
don't hate me
just because I'm the one to tell you
that life is hard enough when you belong here
life is hard enough when you belong here
shelve your western plans
life is hard enough when you belong here

 

ANGEL, ANGEL, DOWN WE GO TOGETHER

Angel, Angel
don't take your life tonight
I know they take
and that they take in turn
and they give you nothing real
for yourself in return
and when they've used you
and they've broken you
and wasted all your money
and cast your shell aside
and when they've bought you
and they've sold you
and they've billed you for the pleasure
and they've made your parents cry
I will be here
BELIEVE ME
I will be here
...believe me
Angel, don't take your life
some people have got no pride
they do not understand
the Urgency of life
but I love you more than life
I love you more than life
I love you more than life
I love you more than life

 

LALE NIGHT, MAUDLIN STREET

The last night on Maudlin Street
goodbye house
goodbye stairs
I was born here
I was raised here, and
...I took some stick here
love at first sight
may sound trite
but it's true, you know
I could list the details
of everything you ever wore
or said, or how you stood that day
and as we spend the last night
on Maudlin Street, I say
"goodbye house-forever!"
I never stole a happy hour
around here
Where the world's ugliest boy
became what you see
here I am - the ugliest man
Its the last night on Maudlin Street
and truly I do love you
oh, truly I do love you
When I sleep with that picture of
you framed beside my bed
oh, it's childish and it's silly
but I think it's you in my room
by the bed (...yes, I told you it was silly...)
and I know
I took strange pills
but I never meant to hurt you
oh truly I love you
I came home late one night
everyone had gone to bed
nobody stays up for you
when you have sixteen stitches
all around your head
the last buss I missed to Maudlin Street
so, he drove me home in the Van
complaining: "Women only like me for my mind..."
don't leave your torch behind
power-cuts ahead
as we crept through the park
but no I cannot steal a pair of jeans
off a clothesline for you
but you...without clothes
oh I could not keep a straight face
me - without clothes?
well a nation turns its back and gags...
I'm packed
I am moving house
a half-life disappears today
every slag waves me on
(secretly wishing me gone
well, I will be soon
oh - I will be soon)
There were bad times on Maudlin Street
when they took you away in a police car
dear Inspector - don't you know?
don't you care?
don't you know - about Love?
Your gran died
and your mother died
on Maudlin Street
in pain and ashamed
with never time to say
those special things
I took the keys from Maudlin Street
well, it's only bricks and mortar!
and...truly I do love you
wherever you are
wherever you are

 

SUEDHEAD

Why do you come here
why do you hang around
I'm so sorry
I'm so sorry
Why do you come here
when you know it makes
things hard for me
when you know, oh
why do you come?
Why do you telephone?
and why send me silly notes?
I'm so sorry
I'm so sorry
why do you come here
when you know it makes
thing hard for me
when you know, oh
why do you come?
You had to sneak into my room
'just' to read my diary
was it just to see all the things
you knew I'd written about you?
and...so many illustrations
I'm so very sickened
oh, I am so sickened NOW

 

BREAK UP THE FAMILY

The strange logic of your clumsiest line
stayed emblazoned on my mind
break up the family
and lets begin to live our lives
I went to see all my friends tonight
it wasn't Youth, it wasn't even Life
born Old, sadly wise
resigned (well, we were)
to ending our lives
I'm so glad to grow older
to move away from those awful times
I want to see all my friends tonight
Yes you found love but you weren't
at peace with your life
home late, full of Hate
despise the ties that bind
oh I'm so glad to grow older
to move away from those younger years
now I'm in love for the first time
and I don't feel bad
Let me see all my old friends
let me put my arm around them
because I really do love them
now, does that sound mad?
Captain of games, solid framed
I stood on the touchline
hailstones, driven home
in his car - no breaks? I don't mind
I'm just so glad to grow older
to move away from those darker years
I'm in love for the first time
and I don't feel bad
so wish me luck my friends
goodbye

 

HAIRDRESSER ON FIRE

Here is London
here is London
is it home of the free,
or what?
can you squeeze me
into an empty page of your diary
and psychologically save me
I've got faith in you
I sense the power
in the fingers
within an hour the power
can totally destroy me
or it could same my life
here is London
'home of the brash, outrageous
and free'
you are repressed
but you're remarkably dressed
is it Real?
but you're far to busy
busy scissors
busy clippers
hair dresser on fire
all around Sloane Square
and you're far too busy
to see me
"busy,busy"
hairdresser on fire
was a client over-cautious
he made you nervous
and when he said
"I'm gonna sue you"
I really felt for you
so can you squeeze me
into an empty page of your diary
and supernaturally change me
CHANGE ME, CHANGE ME

 

THE ORDINARY BOYS

Ordinary boys, happy knowing nothing
happy being no one, but themselves
Ordinary girls, supermarket clothes
who think it's very clever to be cruel to you
for you were so different
you stood all alone
and you knew
that it had to be so
avoiding ordinary boys
happy going nowhere, just around here
in their rattling cars
and ordinary girls
never seeing further
than the cold, small streets
that trap them
but you were so different
you had to say no
when those empty fools
tried to change you, and claim you
for the lair of their ordinary world
where they feel so lucky
so lucky, so lucky
with their lives laid out before them
they're so lucky, so lucky
so lucky, so lucky

 

I DON'T MIND IF YOU FORGET ME

I don't mind
I don't mind if you forget me
having learned my lesson
I never left an impression on anyone
so now you send me your hardened 'regards'
when once you'd send me 'love'
sincerely I must tell you
your mild 'best wishes'
they make me suspicious
but I don't mind
I don't mind if you forget me
having learned my lesson
I never left
an impression on anyone
the pressure to change, to move on
was strange
and very strong
so this is why I tell you
I really do understand
BYE BYE
I don't mind if you forget me
no no no no no no no
REJECTION IS ONE THING
BUT REJECTION FROM A FOOL
IS CRUEL
REJECTION IS ONE THING
BUT REJECTION FROM A FOOL
IS CRUEL
and I don't mind if you forget me
I don't mind if your forget me

 

DIAL-A-CLICHE

Further into the fog I fall
well, I was just
following you!
when you said:
"Do as I do and scrap your fey ways"
(dial-a-cliche)
"grow up, be a man, and close your mealy-mouth!"
(dial-a-cliche)
But the person underneath
where does he go?
does he slide by the wayside?
or...does he just die?
when you find that you've organized
your feelings, for people
who didn't like you then
and certainly don't like you now
yet still you say:
"Do as I do and scrap your fey ways"
(dial-a-cliche)
"grow up, be a man, and close your mealy-mouth!"
(dial-a-cliche)
"the Safe way is the only way!
there's always time to change, son!"
yes well I've changed
but I'm in pain!
dial-a-chiche

 

MARGARET ON THE GUILLOTINE

The kind people
have a wonderful dream
Margaret on the guillotine
because people like you
make me feel so tired
when will you die?
when will you die?
when will you die?
when will you die?
when will you die?
because people like you
make me feel so old inside
please die
and kind people
do not shelter this dream
make it real
make the dream real
make the dream real
make it real

 

OUR FRANK

Our frank and open
deep conversations
they get me nowhere
they bring me down, so
give it a rest, won't you?
give me a cigarette
God give me patience
just no more conversation
Give us a drink
and make it quick
or else I'm gonna be sick
sick all over
your frankly vulgar
red pullover
now see how the colours blend
Our frank and open
deep conversations
they get me nowhere
they bring me down, so
give it a rest, won't you?
now will you just give over
the world may be ending
but look, I'm only human
Give us a drink
and make it quick
or else I'm gonna be sick
all over
your frankly vulgar
red pullover
now see how the two colours blend
Won't somebody stop me
from thinking all the time
about everything
so deeply
so bleakly

 

ASIAN RUT

Day oh so late
strangely the sun still shone
oh Asian boy
what are you on?
Day oh so late
strangely the sun still shone
what drugs are you on?
Tooled-up Asian boy
has come here to avenge
the cruel, cold killing
of his very best friend
Tooled-up Asian boy
has come here to take revenge
for the cruel, cold killing
of his only friend
Peace through the school
so quiet in the hall
it's a strange sign for one
of what's to come
Tough and hard and pale
oh they may just impale you on railings
oh English boys
it must be wrong
three against one?
Brakes slammed, and
a gun jammed, and
as far as I could tell
brave Asian boy
dealt a blow and fell
I'm just passing through here
on my way to somewhere civilised
and maybe I'll even arrive
maybe I'll even arrive?

 

SING YOUR LIFE

Sing your life
any fool can think of words that rhyme
many others do
why don't you?
do you want to?
Sing your life
just walk right up to the microphone
and name
all the things that you love
all the things that you loathe
sing your life
all the things that you love
all the things that you loathe
oh sing your life
oh sing your life
Others sang your life
but now's your chance to shine
and have the pleasure of
saying what you mean
the rare pleasure of
meaning what you sing
oh, make no mistake, my friend
all of this will end
so sing it now
all the things you love
all the things you loathe
oh sing your life
all the things that you love
all the things that you loathe
oh sing your, oh sing your
Don't leave it all unsaid
somewhere in the wasteland of your head
and make no mistake, my friend
your pointless life will end
but before you go
can you look at the truth?
You have a lovely singing voice
a lovely singing voice
and all of those
who sing on key
they stole the notion
from you and me

 

MUTE WITNESS

Your poor witness
crying so loudly on the floor
oh but she's only trying to tell you
what it was that she saw
she is only trying to tell you
what it was that she saw
Now see her standing on the table
with her small arms flailing
and you feel such compassion
in your soul for
Your poor mute witness
still testing the strength
of our patience
oh but she's only trying to tell you
what it was that she saw
Now see her pointing to the frisbee
with a memory too fuzzy
as her silent words
describe the fright of last night
4 a.m. Norhtside, Clapham Common
who knows what she was doing there?
will she sketch the answer later?
Well, I'll ask her
"now dry your tears, my dear"
Now see her mime in time so nicely
it would all have been so clear
is only she had never volunteered
"your taxi is here, my dear"

 

KING LEER

Your boyfriend, he
went down on one knee
well, could it be
he's only got one knee?
I tried to surprise you
with Vodka
or, Tizer
I can't quite remember
but you didn't thank me
you didn't even thank me
because you never do
Your boyfriend, he
has the gift of the gab
or, could it be
the gift of the grab?
I tried to surprise you
I lay down beside you
and...nothing much happened
and you didn't phone me
you didn't even phone me
because it's not your style
to dial
Your boyfriend, he
displays to me
more than just
a hint of cruelty
I tried to surprise you
I crept up behind you
with a homeless chihuahua
you gushed for an hour
you handed him back and said
"You'll never guess
I'm bored now"

 

FOUND FOUND FOUND

found found found found found found
someone who's worth it
in this murkiness
someone who's never
seeming scheming
found found found found found found
someone who's worth it
in this murkiness
someone who's never
seeming scheming
Oh, but if I'd never found
oh, but if I'd never found
oh, but if I'd never found
I do believe that
the more you give your love
and I do believe that
the more you offer trust
the more you chase
the more you cry
the more you're bound to lose
the more you're bound to lose
Oh, but if I'd never found
oh, but if I'd never found
somebody
who wants to be
who wants to be
with me
all the time

 

DRIVING YOUR GIRLFRIEND HOME

I'm driving
your girlfriend home
and she's saying
how she never chose you
"turn left", she says
so I turn left
and she says
"So how did I end up
so deeply involved in
the very existence
I planned on avoiding?"
and I can't answer
I'm driving
your girlfriend home
and she's laughing
to stop herself crying
"drive on", she says
so I drive on
and she says
"So how did I end up
attached to this person
when his sense of humour
gets gradually worser?"
and I can't tell her
I'm parking
outside her home
and we're shaking hands
goodnight, so politely

 

THE HARSH TRUTH OF THE CAMERA EYE

Churchillian legs
hair barely there
the harsh truth of the camera eye
Your eyes signal pain
because of the strain
of smiling
the harsh truth of the camera eye
telling you all
that you never wnated to know
showing what
you didn't want shown
My so friendly lens
zooms into
"the inner you"
and it tells the harsh truth
and nothing but
Laugh with us all here
that's if you can
then take the pictures home
and screamtelling you all
that you never wanted to know
showing you what
you didn't want shown
This photographer
he must have really had it in for you
"Oh, I don't want
to be judged anymore
I don't wnat to be judged
I would sooner be Loved
I would sooner be
just blindly Loved..."

 

(I'M) THE END OF THE FAMILY LINE

With no complications
fifteen generations
(of mine)
all honouring Nature
until I arrive
(with incredible style)
I'm the end fo the line
the end of the family line
the end of the line
No baby pulled screaming
out into this seething whirl
by chance or whim
(or even love?)
our family tree hacked into decline
and I'm spared the pain
of ever saying
("goodbye")
I'm the end of the line
the end of the family line
the end of the line

 

THERE'S A PLACE IN HELL FOR ME AND MY FRIENDS

There is a place
reserved
for me and my friends
and when we go
we all will go
so you see
I'm never alone
there is a place
with a bit more time
and a few more
gentler words
and looking back
we do forgive
(we had no choice
we always did)
all that we hope
is that when we go
our skin
and our blood
and our bones
don't get in your way
making you ill
the way they did
when we lived
There is a place
a place in hell
reserved
for me and my friends
and if ever I
wanted to cry
then I will
because I can

 

TONY THE PONY

Still drinking on the corner 
Just don't say I didn't warn you 
Always nagging big brother 
He's only looking out for you 
Tony The Pony 
Tony The Pony 
You're still standing on the corner 
Just don't say I didn't warn you 
Old and jealous big brother 
You had your time and you spent it 
Crying 
Now, Tony The Pony 
Tony The Pony 
So, that's what they call you now ? 
When you're free outside 
So cold and hard and in control 
And ... 
There's a free ride on 
Tony The Pony 
Oh, why do you always wanna stop me 
From doing the things in life that make me happy ? 
And when I'm outside with friends, laughing loudly 
Why do you always wanna stop me ? 
Oh, I would never 
I would never 
But you will carry the can for anyone 
The free ride on 
Gullible Tony 
You're drunker quicker 
And you're sicker even quicker 
For something heavy is gonna fall on you 
Oh ... 
And what do they call you now ? 
When you're free outside 
So cold and hard and in control 
And, oh ... been a lark 
There's a free ride on 
Fucked-up Tony 
I will never say I told you so 
Or how I knew that something bad 
Would happen to you 
I don't wanna say I told you so 
Oh, but Tony, I told you so !!! 
I told you so

 

YOU'RE GONNA NEED SOMEONE ON YOUR SIDE

With the world's fate 
Resting on your shoulder 
You're gonna need 
Someone on your side 
You can't do it by yourself 
Any longer 
You're gonna need 
Someone on your side 
Someone kindly told me 
That you'd wasted 
Eight of nine lives
Oh, give yourself a break 
Before you break down 
You're gonna need someone on your side 
And here I am, And here I am 
Well, you don't need 
To look so pleased ! 
Day or night, 
There is no difference 
You're gonna need someone on your side 
Day or night, 
There is no difference 
You're gonna need someone soon 
And here I am, And here I am 
Well, you don't need 
To look so pleased

 

GLAMOROUS GLUE

First day with the jar 
You find 
Everyone lies 
First day with the jar 
You find 
Everyone lies, nobody minds 
Everyone lies 
Where is the man you respect ? 
And where is the woman you love ? 
Where's the woman you love ? 
Third week with the jar
You find 
Everything dies 
We won't vote Conservative 
Because we never have 
Everyone lies, everyone lies 
Where is the man you respect ? 
And where is the woman you love ? 
Where's the woman you love ? 
Everything of worth 
On Earth Is there To share 
I used to dream, and I used to vow 
I wouldn't dream of it now 
We look to Los Angeles 
For the language we use 
London is dead, London is dead, London is dead...
Now I'm too much in love 
I'm too much in love 
I know 
I'll go 
Empty hand 
From the land

 

WE'LL LET YOU KNOW

How sad are we ? 
And how sad have we been ? 
We'll let you know 
We'll let you know 
Oh, but only if - you're really interested 
You wonder how 
We've stayed alive 'till now 
We'll let you know 
We'll let you know 
But only if - you're really interested 
We're all smiles 
Then, honest, I swear, it's the turnstiles 
That make us hostile 
Oh ... 
We will descend 
On anyone unable to defend 
Themselves 
Oh ... 
And the songs we sing 
They're not supposed to mean a thing 
La, la, la, la ... 
Oh ...You're lonely, Oh ... you're lonely, Oh ... 
GET OFF THE ROOF ! Oh ... 
Your Arsenal !
We may seem cold, or 
We may even be 
The most depressing people you've ever known 
At heart, what's left, we sadly know 
That we are the last truly British people you'll ever know 
We are the last truly British people you will ever know 
You'll never never want to know

 

THE NATIONAL FRONT DISCO

David, the wind blows 
The wind blows ... 
Bits of your life away 
Your friends all say ... 
"Where is our boy ? Oh, we've lost our boy" 
But they should know 
Where you've gone 
Because again and again you've explained that 
You're going to ... 
Oh, you're going to ... 
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah 
England for the English ! 
England for the English ! 
David, the winds blow 
The winds blow ...
All of my dreams away 
And I still say : 
"Where is our boy ? Ah, we've lost our boy" 
But I should know 
Why you've gone 
Because again and again you've explained
You've gone to the ... 
National, ah ... 
To the National .. 
There's a country; you don't live there 
But one day you would like to 
And if you show them what you're made of 
Oh, then you might do ... 
But David, we wonder 
We wonder if the thunder 
Is ever really gonna begin 
Begin, begin 
Your mom says : 
"I've lost my boy" 
But she should know 
Why you've gone 
Because again and again you've explained 
You've gone to the : 
National 
To the National 
To the National Front Disco 
Because you want the day to come sooner 
You want the day to come sooner 
You want the day to come sooner 
When you've settled the score 
Oh, the National 
Oh, the National

 

CERTAIN PEOPLE I KNOW

I take the cue from 
Certain people I know 
I use the cue 
And then I 
Hand it on to you 
And when I swing it 
So, it catches his eye ... 
(Weren't you there ? 
- You'd have died !) 
I trust the views of 
Certain people I know 
They look at Danger 
And they 
LAUGH THEIR HEADS OFF 
Their clothes are Imitation 
George the 23rd 
(Don't you find this absurd ?) 
I'd hate to be like 
Certain people I know 
They break their necks 
And can't afford to
Get them fixed 
Ah, they'd sacrifice all 
Of their principles for 
anything cashable 
I do believe it's terrible 
Oh, wo, wo, Ah, ah, ah, ah, Oh, wo, wo...

 

WE HATE IT WHEN OUR FRIENDS BECOME SUCCESSFUL

We hate it when our friends become successful 
We hate it when our friends become successful 
Oh, look at those clothes 
Now look at that face, it's so old 
And such a video ! 
Well, it's really laughable 
Ha, ha, ha ...
We hate it when our friends become successful 
And if they're Northern, that makes it even worse
And if we can destroy them 
You bet your life we will 
Destroy them 
If we can hurt them 
Well, we may as well ... 
It's really laughable 
Ha, ha, ha ... 
You see, it should've been me 
It could've been me 
Everybody knows 
Everybody says so 
They say : 
"Ah, you have loads of songs 
So many songs 
More songs than they'd stand 
Verse 
Chorus 
Middle eight 
Break, fade 
Just listen ..."
La, la-la, la-la

SEASICK, YET STILL DOCKED

I am a poor freezingly cold soul 
So far from where 
I intended to go 
Scavenging through life's very constant lulls 
So far from where I'm determined to go 
Wish I knew the way to reach the one I love
There is no way ... 
Wish I had the charm to attract the one I love 
But you see, I've got no charm 
Mmm...
Tonight I've consumed much more than I can hold 
Oh, this is very clear to you 
And you can tell I have never really loved 
You can tell, by the way, I sleep all day
And all of my life no-one gave me anything 
No-one has ever given me anything 
My love is as sharp as a needle in your eye 
You must be such a fool 
To pass me by

 

I KNOW IT'S GONNA HAPPEN SOMEDAY

My love, wherever you are 
Whatever you are 
Don't lose faith 
I know it's gonna happen someday 
To you 
Please wait ... Please wait ... Oh ... Wait ... 
Don't lose faith 
You say that the day just never arrives 
And it's never seemed so far away 
Still, I know it's gonna happen someday 
To you 
Please wait ... 
Don't lose faith

 

TOMORROW

Tomorrow 
Will it really come ? 
And if it does come 
Will I still be Human ? 
All I ask of you is one thing that you never do 
Would you put your arms around me ? 
(I won't tell anyone) 
Tomorrow 
Does it have to come ?
All I ask of you is one thing that you'll never do 
Would you put your arms around me ? 
(I won't tell anybody) 
Tomorrow 
And what must come before ...
Oh, the pain in my arms 
Oh, the pain in my legs 
Ooh, my shiftless body 
Tomorrow 
It's surely nearer now ? 
You don't think I'll make it 
I never said I wanted to ! 
Well did I ? 
Oh, the pain in my arms 
Oh, the pain in my legs 
Oh, yeah; oh, yeah, No, yeah; no, yeah 
Through my shiftless body 
Tomorrow, Tomorrow 
All I ask of you ... oh ... 
Is : would you tell me that you love me 
Tell me, tell me that you love me, Tell me, tell me that you love me ... 
Ah, I know you don't mean it 
Ah, I know you don't mean it 
Tell me, tell me that you love me, Tell me, tell me that you love me ...

NOVEMBER SPAWNED A MONSTER

Sleep on and dream of Love
because it's the closest you will get to love
poor twisted child, so ugly, so ugly
poor twisted child, oh hug me, oh hug me
one November spawned a monster 
in the shape of this child who later cried
"But Jesus made me, so Jesus save me from
pity, sympathy and people discussing me"
a frame of useless limbs what can make GOOD
all the BAD that's been done?
And if the lights were out
could you even bear
to kiss her full on the mouth (or anywhere?)
poor twisted child, so ugly, so ugly
poor twisted child, oh hug me, oh hug me
one November spawned a monster 
in the shape of this child who must remain
a hostage to kindess and the wheels underneath her
a hostage to kindess and the wheels underneath her
a symbol of where mad, mad lovers
must PAUSE and draw the line
So sleep and dream of love
because it's the closest
you will get to love
that November is a time which I must put OUT of my mind
oh one fine day 
LET IT BE SOON
she won't be rich or beautiful
but she'll be walking your streets
in the clothes that she went out
and chose for herself

 

SEASICK, YET STILL DOCKED

I am a poor freezingly cold soul 
So far from where 
I intended to go 
Scavenging through life's very constant lulls 
So far from where I'm determined to go

THE LOOP

I just wanna say 
I haven't been away 
I'm still right here 
Where I always was 
So one day, if you're bored 
By all means call 
Because you can do 
(But only if you want to) 
I just wanna say 
I haven't been away 
I am still right here 
Where I always was 
So one day, when you're bored 
By all means call 
Because you can do 
But you might not get through

 

SISTER I'M A POET

All over this town 
Yes, a low wind may blow 
And I can see through everybo... 
With no reason 
To hide these words I feel 
And no reason 
To talk about the books I read 
But still I do 
That's 'cause I'm a ... Sister I'm a ... 
All over this town 
Along this way 
Outside the prison gates 
I love the romance of crime 
And I wonder 
Does anybody feel the way I do ? 
And is evil just something you are 
Or something you do ? 
Sister I'm a ... Sister I'm a ... 
All over this town, All over this town 
They pull over 
In their Citroen vans 
Not to shake your hand 
With meths on their breaths 
And you with youth on your side 
A plastic bag stranded at the lights 
This once was me ...
But now I'm a ... Sister I'm a ...
All over this town ... Oh, oh, oh 
All over this town, All over this town, Oh ... 
I still cannot speak French ... I am very lazy

 

JACK THE RIPPER

Oh, you look so tired 
Mouth slack and wide 
Ill-housed and ill-advised 
Your face is as mean 
As your life has been 
Crash into my arms 
I WANT YOU 
You don't agree -
But you don't refuse 
I know you 
And I know a place 
Where no one is likely to pass 
Oh, you don't care if it's late 
And you don't care if you're lost 
And oh, you look so tired 
(But tonight you presumed too much) 
Too much, too much 
And if it's the last 
Thing I ever do 
I'M GONNA GET YOU 
Crash into my arms 
I WANT YOU 
You don't agree -
But you don't refuse 
I know you 
And no one knows a thing about my life 
I can come and go as I please 
And if I want to, I can stay 
Oh, or if I want to, I can leave 
Nobody knows me, Nobody knows me, Nobody knows me Oh, oh...

 

SUCH A LITTLE THING MAKES SUCH A BIG DIFFERENCE

Such a little thing, such a little thing
but the difference it made was grave
there you go
wielding a bicycle chain
oh why won't you change
cange and be nicer?
such a little thing
a gentle tone of kindness
or written words on paper
- can you write?
How I love all of
the very simple things of life
(God's good air)
how I love all of
the very simple things of life
such a little thing
a fumbling politeness
the difference it saved me
wielding a bicycle chain
"I WILL NOT CHANGE AND I WILL NOT BE NICE"
Most people keep their brains between your legs (don't you find?)
Leave me alone - I was only singing, leave me alone because
I was only singing
leave me alone - I was only singing, leave me alone
you have just proved (again)
MOST PEOPLE KEEP THEIR BRAINS BETWEEN THEIR LEGS

 

I KNOW IT'S GONNA HAPPEN SOMEDAY

My love, wherever you are 
Whatever you are 
Don't lose faith 
I know it's gonna happen someday 
To you 
Please wait ... 
Please wait ... 
Oh ... Wait ... 
Don't lose faith 
You say that the day just never arrives 
And it's never seemed so far away 
Still, I know it's gonna happen someday 
To you 
Please wait ... 
Don't lose faith

 

WE'LL LET YOU KNOW

How sad are we ? 
And how sad have we been ? 
We'll let you know, We'll let you know 
Oh, but only if - you're really interested 
You wonder how 
We've stayed alive 'till now 
We'll let you know, We'll let you know 
But only if - you're really interested 
We're all smiles 
Then, honest, I swear, it's the turnstiles 
That make us hostile 
Oh ... We will descend 
On anyone unable to defend 
Themselves 
Oh ... And the songs we sing 
They're not supposed to mean a thing 
La, la, la, la ... Oh ...
You're lonely, Oh ... you're lonely 
Oh ... 
GET OFF THE ROOF !
Oh ... Your Arsenal !
We may seem cold, or 
We may even be 
The most depressing people you've ever known 
At heart, what's left, we sadly know 
That we are the last truly British people you'll ever know 
We are the last truly British people you will ever know 
You'll never never want to know

 

SUEDHEAD

Why do you come here
why do you hang around
I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry
Why do you come here
when you know it makes
things hard for me
when you know, oh
why do you come?
Why do you telephone?
and why send me silly notes?
I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry
why do you come here
when you know it makes
thing hard for me
when you know, oh
why do you come?
You had to sneak into my room
'just' to read my diary
was it just to see all the things
you knew I'd written about you?
and...so many illustrations
I'm so very sickened
oh, I am so sickened NOW

 

HE KNOWS I'D LOVE TO SEE HIM

He Knows (he knows)
Or, I think he does
because when I lived
in the Arse of the world...
he knows, he knows, he knows I'd love
to see him happy (or as close as is allowed)
because when I lived
in the Arse of the world
he knows, he knows, he knows I'd love
to see him happy (or as close as possible
as close as possible, as close as is allowed)
My name still conjours up deadly deeds
and a bad taste in the mouth
the police - they actually knew me
they said:
"You're just another person in the world
you're just another fool with radical views
you're just another who has maddening views
you want to turn it on its head
by staying in bed!"
I said: "I know I do"

 

YOU'RE GONNA NEED SOMEONE ON YOUR SIDE

With the world's fate 
Resting on your shoulder 
You're gonna need 
Someone on your side 
You can't do it by yourself 
Any longer 
You're gonna need 
Someone on your side 
Someone kindly told me 
That you'd wasted 
Eight of nine lives
Oh, give yourself a break 
Before you break down 
You're gonna need someone on your side 
And here I am, And here I am 
Well, you don't need 
To look so pleased ! 
Day or night, 
There is no difference 
You're gonna need someone on your side 
Day or night, 
There is no difference 
You're gonna need someone soon 
And here I am, And here I am 
Well, you don't need 
To look so pleased

 

GLAMOROUS GLUE

First day with the jar 
You find 
Everyone lies 
First day with the jar 
You find 
Everyone lies, nobody minds, Everyone lies 
Where is the man you respect ? 
And where is the woman you love ? 
Where's the woman you love ? 
Third week with the jar
You find 
Everything dies 
We won't vote Conservative 
Because we never have 
Everyone lies, everyone lies 
Where is the man you respect ? 
And where is the woman you love ? 
Where's the woman you love ? 
Everything of worth 
On Earth, Is there, To share 
I used to dream, and I used to vow 
I wouldn't dream of it now 
We look to Los Angeles 
For the language we use 
London is dead, London is dead, London is dead, ...
Now I'm too much in love 
I'm too much in love, 
I know I'll go 
Empty hand 
From the land

 

WE HATE IT WHEN OUR FRIENDS BECOME SUCCESSFUL

We hate it when our friends become successful 
We hate it when our friends become successful 
Oh, look at those clothes 
Now look at that face, it's so old 
And such a video ! 
Well, it's really laughable 
Ha, ha, ha ...
We hate it when our friends become successful 
And if they're Northern, that makes it even worse
And if we can destroy them 
You bet your life we will 
Destroy them 
If we can hurt them 
Well, we may as well ... 
It's really laughable 
Ha, ha, ha ... 
You see, it should've been me 
It could've been me 
Everybody knows 
Everybody says so 
They say : 
"Ah, you have loads of songs 
So many songs 
More songs than they'd stand 
Verse 
Chorus 
Middle eight 
Break, fade 
Just listen ..."
La, la-la, la-la

 

NOW MY HEART IS FULL

There's gonna be some trouble 
A whole house will need re-building 
And everyone I love in the house 
Will recline on an analyst's couch quite 
Soon 
Your Father cracks a joke 
And in the usual way 
Empties the room 
Tell all of my friends 
(I don't have too many 
Just some rain-coated lovers' puny brothers)
Dallow, Spicer, Pinkie, Cubitt 
Rush to danger 
Wind up nowhere 
Patric Doonan - raised to wait 
I'm tired again, I've tried again, and 
Now my heart is full 
Now my heart is full 
And I just can't explain 
So I won't even try to
Dallow, Spicer, Pinkie, Cubitt 
Every jammy Stressford poet 
Loafing oafs in all-night chemists 
Loafing oafs in all-night chemists 
Underact - express depression 
Ah, but Bunnie I loved you 
I was tired again 
I've tried again, and 
Now my heart is full 
Now my heart is full 
And I just can't explain 
So I won't even try to 
Could you pass by ? 
Could you pass by ? 
Oh ... 
Now my heart is full 
Now my heart is full 
And I just can't explain 
So ... slow ... 
Slow ... slow ... slow ... slow ... slow ...

 

SPRING-HEELED JIM

Spring-heeled Jim winks an eye 
He'll "do", he'll never be "done to" 
He takes on whoever flew through 
"Well, it's the normal thing to do" ... ah ... 
Spring-heeled Jim lives to love 
Now kissing with his mouth full 
And his eyes on some other fool 
So many women 
His head should be spinning 
Ah, but no ! 
Ah, but no ! 
But no !
Ah, no !
Spring-heeled Jim slurs the words : 
"There's no need to be so knowing
Take life at five times the 
Average speed, like I do" 
Until Jim feels the chill 
"Oh, where did all the time go ?" 
Once always in for the kill 
Now it's too cold 
And he feels too 
old 
Too old
Mmm, old... 
La, la, la, la-la, la ...

 

BILLY BUDD

Say, Billy Budd 
So you think you should ? 
Oh, everyone's laughing 
Say, Billy Budd 
So you think that you should ? 
Everyone's laughing ! 
Since I took up with you 
Things have been bad 
Yeah, but now it's 12 years on 
Now it's 12 years on 
Yes, and I took up with you 
I took my job application 
Into town 
Did you hear ? They turned me down 
Yes, and it's all because of us 
Oh, and what was in our eyes 
Oh, what was in our eyes, yeah 
I said, Billy Budd 
I would happily lose 
Both of my legs 
I would lose both of my legs 
Oh, if it meant you could be free 
Oh, if it meant you could be free 
(Don't leave us in the dark!)

 

HOLD ON TO YOUR FRIENDS

A bond of trust 
Has been abused 
Something of value 
May be lost 
Give up your job 
Squander your cash - be rash 
Just hold on to your friends 
There are more than enough 
To fight and oppose 
Why waste good time 
Fighting the people you like 
Who will fall defending your name 
Oh, don't feel so ashamed 
To have friends 
But now you only call me 
When you're feeling depressed 
When you feel happy I'm 
So far from your mind 
My patience is stretched 
My loyalty vexed 
Oh, you're losing all of your friends 
Hold on to your friends 
Hold on to your friends 
Resist - or move on 
Be mad, be rash 
Smoke and explode 
Sell all of your clothes 
Just bear in mind : 
Oh, there just might come a time 
When you need some friends

 

THE MORE YOU IGNORE ME, THE CLOSER I GET

The more you ignore me 
The closer I get 
You're wasting your time 
The more you ignore me 
The closer I get 
You're wasting your time 
I will be 
In the bar 
With my head 
On the bar 
I am now 
A central part 
Of your mind's landscape 
Whether you care 
Or do not 
Yeah, I've made up your mind 
The more you ignore me 
The closer I get 
You're wasting your time 
The more you ignore me 
The closer I get 
You're wasting your time 
Beware !
I bear more grudges 
Than lonely high court judges 
When you sleep 
I will creep 
Into your thoughts 
Like a bad debt 
That you can't pay 
Take the easy way 
And give in 
Yeah, and let me in 
Oh, let me in 
Oh let me ... 
Oh, let me in 
IT'S WAR 
IT'S WAR 
WAR 
WAR 
Oh, let me in 
Ah, the closer I get 
Ah, you're asking for it 
Ah, the closer I get 
Ooh, the closer I ...

 

WHY DON'T YOU FIND OUT FOR YOURSELF

The sanest days are mad 
Why don't you find out for yourself ? 
Then you'll see the price 
Very closely 
Some men here 
They have a special interest 
In your career 
They wanna help you to grow 
And then syphon all your dough 
Why don't you find out for yourself ? 
Then you'll see the glass 
Hidden in the grass 
You'll never believe me, so 
Why don't you find out for yourself ? 
Sick down to my heart 
That's just the way it goes 
Some men here 
They know the full extent of 
Your distress 
They kneel and pray 
And they say : 
"Long may it last" 
Why don't you find out for yourself ?
Then you'll see the glass 
Hidden in the grass 
Bad scenes come and go 
For which you must allow 
Sick down to my heart 
That's just the way it goes 
Don't rake up my mistakes 
I know exactly what they are 
And ... what do YOU do ? 
Well ... you just SIT THERE 
I've been stabbed in the back 
So many many times 
I don't have any skin 
But that's just the way it goes

 

I AM HATED FOR LOVING

I am hated for loving 
I am hated for loving 
Anonymous call, a poison pen 
A brick in the small of the back again 
I still don't belong 
To anyone - I am mine 
And I am hated for loving 
I am haunted for wanting 
Anonymous call, a poison pen 
A brick in the ... ah ... 
A brick in the small of the back again 
I still don't belong 
To anyone - I am mine 
I am falling 
With no-one to catch me 
I am falling 
And there's still 
No-one to catch me 
Ah .. 
Anonymous call, a poison pen 
A brick in the ... ah ... 
A brick in the small of the back again 
I just don't belong 
To anywhere 
I just don't belong 
Mmm ... 
Ah ...

 

LIFEGUARD SLEEPING, GIRL DROWNING

Always looking for attention 
Always needs to be mentioned 
Who does she 
Think she should be ? 
The shrill cry through darkening air 
Doesn't she know he's 
Had such a busy day ? 
Tell her ... sshhh
Somebody tell her ... sshhh 
Slowest ... 
It was only a test 
But she swam too far 
Against the tide 
She deserves all she gets 
The sky became marked with stars 
As an out-stretched arm slowly 
Disappears 
Hooray 
Oh hooray 
No, oh, oh, woh, there's no movement 
No, oh, hooray 
Oh, hooray 
Please don't worry 
There'll be no fuss 
She was ... nobody's nothing 
(What's your name ?) 
When he awoke 
The sea was calm 
And another day passes like a dream 
There's no ... no way 
(What's your name ?)

 

USED TO BE A SWEET BOY

Used to be a sweet boy 
Holding so tightly 
To Daddy's hand 
But that was all 
In some distant land 
Blazer and tie 
And a big bright healthy smile 
Used to make all 
Of our trials worthwhile 
Used to be a sweet boy 
And I'm not to blame 
Something went wrong 
And I know 
I'm not to blame 
Something went wrong 
Can't be to blame 
Ah ...

 

THE LAZY SUNBATHERS

A world war 
Was announced 
Days ago 
But they didn't know 
The lazy sunbathers 
The lazy sunbathers 
The sun burns through 
To the planet's core 
And it isn't enough 
They want more 
Nothing 
Appears 
To be 
Between the ears of 
The lazy sunbathers 
Too jaded 
To question stagnation 
The sun burns through 
To the planet's core 
And it isn't enough 
They want more 
Religions fall 
Children shelled 
"...Children shelled ? That's all 
Very well, but would you 
Please keep the noise 
Down low ? 
Because you're waking 
The lazy sunbathers ..."
Oh, the lazy sunbathers 
The lazy sunbathers

 

SPEEDWAY

And when you slam 
Down the hammer 
Can you see it in your heart ? 
All of the rumours 
Keeping me grounded 
I never said, I never said that they were 
Completely unfounded 
So when you slam 
Down the hammer 
Can you see it in your heart ? 
Can you delve so low ? 
And when you're standing 
On my fingers 
Can you see it in your heart ? ... ah ... 
And when you try 
To break my spirit 
It won't work 
Because there's nothing left to break 
Anymore 
All of the rumours 
Keeping me grounded 
I never said, I never said that they were 
Completely unfounded 
You won't sleep 
Until the earth that wants me 
Finally has me 
Oh you've done it now 
You won't rest 
Until the hearse that becomes me 
Finally takes me 
Oh you've done it now 
And you won't smile 
Until my loving mouth 
Is shut good and proper 
FOREVER 
All of the rumours 
Keeping me grounded 
I never said, I never said that they were 
Completely unfounded 
And all those lies 
Written lies, twisted lies 
Well, they weren't lies 
They weren't lies 
They weren't lies 
I never said 
I never said 
I could have mentioned your name 
I could have dragged you in 
Guilt by implication 
By association 
I've always been true to you 
In my own strange way 
I've always been true to you 
In my own sick way 
I'll always stay true to you

 

THE TEACHERS ARE AFRAID OF THE PUPILS

There's too many people 
Planning your downfall 
When your spirit's on trial 
These nights can be frightening 
Sleep transports sadness 
To some other mid-brain 
And somebody here 
Will not be here next year 
So you stand by the board 
Full of fear and intention 
And, if you think that they're listening 
Well, you've got to be joking 
Oh, you understand change 
And you think it's essential 
But when your profession 
Is humiliation 
Say the wrong word to our children ...
We'll have you, oh yes, we'll have you 
Lay a hand on our children 
And it's never too late to have you 
Mucus on your collar 
A nail up through the staff chair 
A blade in your soap 
And you cry into your pillow 
To be finished would be a relief 
To be finished would be a relief... 
Say the wrong word to our children ...
We'll have you, oh yes, we'll have you 
Lay a hand on our children 
And it's never too late to have you 
To be finished would be a relief 
To be finished would be a relief...
I'm very glad this thing has come 
Sometimes I'm so glad 
Never bother to play the tunes 
I've seen it coming for dear life

 

READER MEET AUTHOR

You don't know a thing about their lives 
They live where you wouldn't dare to drive
You shake as you think of how they sleep 
But you write as if you are my side-by-side 
Reader, meet Author 
With the hope of hearing sense 
But you may be feeling let down 
By the words of defence 
He says : "No-one ever sees me when I cry"
You don't know a thing about their lives 
Books don't save them, books aren't Stanley knives 
And if a fight broke out here tonight 
You'd be the first away, because you're that type 
And the Year 2000 won't change anyone here 
As each fabled promise flies so fast 
You'll swear it was never there 
Oh, have you ever escaped from a shipwrecked life ? 
So safely with your software; all miles from the front line 
You hear the way their sad voices, and you start to imagine things 
Oh, any excuse to write more lies

 

THE BOY RACER

He's just too good-natured and 
He's got too much money and 
He's got too many girlfriends 
I'm jealous, that's all 
Have you seen him go, though, oh ? 
Have you seen him go, though, oh ? 
Boy racer, Boy racer, oh 
We're gonna kill this pretty thing

Boy racer, Boy racer, oh 
We're gonna kill this pretty thing 
Boy racer, Boy racer, oh 
We're gonna kill this pretty thing 
He thinks he got the whole world in his hands 
Stood at the urinal 
He thinks he got the whole world in his hands 
And I'm gonna ... kill him !
Oh, no ! Oh, no ! Oh, no ! Oh, no ! Oh, no !Oh .... 
Boy racer Boy racer, oh 
We're gonna kill this pretty thing...
He's just too good-looking, and, And, and ... 
Boy racer Boy racer, oh

THE OPERATION

You fight with your right hand 
And caress with your left hand 
Everyone I know is sick to death of you 
With a tear that's a mile wide 
In the kite that you're flying 
Everyone I know is sick to death of you 
Ever since 
You don't look the same 
You're just not the same, no way 
You say clever things and 
You never used to 
You don't catch what I'm saying 
When you're deafened to advice 
Everyone here is sick to the 
Back teeth of you 
With a tear that's a mile wide 
In the kite that you're flying 
Everyone here is sick to the 
Tattoo of you 
Ever since 
You don't look the same 
You're just not the same, no way 
You say pleasant things and 
There is no need to
Still, you fight with your right hand 
And caress with your left hand 
Ooh, ooh ... Sad to say ... 
How once I was in love with you 
Sad to say ... 
You don't catch what I'm saying 
When you're deafened to advice 
Ooh, ooh ... Ever since 
You don't look the same 
You're just not the same, no way 
What the hell have 
They stuck into you ?

 

DAGENHAM DAVE

Head in the clouds, and a mouthful of pie 
Head in a blouse, everybody loves him 
I see why 
Dagenham Dave, Dagenham Dave, Oh, Dagenham Dave 
Dagenham Dave, Dagenham Dave, Oh, Dagenham Dave 
"I love Karen, I love Sharon" on the windowscreen 
With never the need to fight or to question a single thing 
Dagenham Dave, Dagenham Dave Oh, Dagenham Dave 
Dagenham Dave, Dagenham Dave Oh, Dagenham Dave ...
He'd love to touch, he's afraid that he might self-combust 
I could say more, but you get the general idea

DO YOUR BEST AND DON'T WORRY

Compare the best of their days 
With the worst of your days 
You won't win 
With your standards so high 
And your spirits so low 
At least remember ... 
This is you on a bad day, you on a pale day 
Just do your best and don't ... Don't worry, oh 
The way you hang yourself is oh, so unfair 
See the best of how they look 
Against the worst of how you are
And again, you won't win 
With your standards so high 
And your spirits so low 
At least remember ... 
This is you on a drab day, you in a drab dress 
Just do your best and don't ... Don't worry, oh 
The way you hang yourself is oh, so unfair 
Just do your best and don't ... Don't worry, oh 
The way you watch yourself is oh, so unfair 
Just do your best and don't ... Don't worry, oh 
Do your best and don't ...

You were a boy before you became a man 
I don't see the joy 
And you ran with your pals in the sun 
You turned around and they were gone 
Again ... 
A sick boy should be treated 
So easily defeated 
Oh, I just don't understand 
So you ran with your pals in the sun 
You turned around 
You were alone 
Again ... 
And you ran back to Ma 
Which set the pace for the rest of your days 
Oh, you ran back to Ma 
Which set the pace for the rest of your days 
Oh, you ran back to Ma 
Which set the pace for the rest of your days 
And now, there is something that you should know 
There is something that you should know 
The girl of your dreams is 
Here all alone 
Girl of your dreams is 
Here all alone 
The girl of your dreams is 
Sad and all alone 
The girl of your dreams is 
Here all alone 
There is something that you should know 
There is something that you should know 
Girl of your dreams is 
Here all alone 
The girl of your dreams is 
Sad and is all alone 
The girl of your dreams is 
Sad and is feeling all alone 
Oh, there is something that you should know 
Help me, help me, help me ...

 

MALADJUSTED

I wanna start from 
Before the beginning 
Loot wine, "Be mine, and 
Then let's stay out for the night"
Ride via Parkside 
Semi-perilous lives 
Jeer the lights in the windows 
Of all safe and stable homes 
(But wondering then, well what 
Could peace of mind be like ?)
Anyway do you want to hear 
Our story, or not ? 
As the Fulham Road lights 
Stretch and invite into the night 
From a Stevenage overspill 
We'd kill to live around 
SW6 - with someone like you 
Keep thieves' hours 
With someone like you 
...As long as it slides 
You stalk the house 
In a low-cut blouse : 
"Oh Christ, another stifled 
Friday night !"
And the Fulham Road lights 
Stretch and invite into the night 
Well, I was fifteen 
What could I know ?
When the gulf between 
All the things I need 
And the things I receive 
Is an ancient ocean 
Wide, wild, lost, uncrossed 
Still I maintain there's nothing 
Wrong with you 
You do all that you do 
Because it's all you can do 
Well, I was fifteen 
Where could I go ?
With a soul full of loathing 
For stinging bureaucracy 
Making it anything 
Other than easy 
For working girls like me 
With my hands on my head 
I flop on your bed 
With a head full of dread 
For all I've ever said 
Maladjusted, maladjusted 
Maladjusted maladjusted 
Never to be trusted 
Oh, never to be trusted 
There's nothing wrong with you, oh 
...There's nothing wrong with you

 

ALMA MATTERS

So : the choice I have made 
May seem strange to you 
But who asked you, anyway ? 
It's my life to wreck 
My own way 
You see : to someone, somewhere, oh yeah ... 
Alma matters 
In mind, body and soul 
In part, and in whole 
Because to someone, somewhere, oh yeah ... 
Alma matters 
In mind, body and soul 
In part, and in whole 
So the life I have made 
May seem wrong to you 
But, I've never been surer 
It's my life to ruin 
My own way 
You see : to someone, somewhere, oh yeah ... 
Alma matters 
In mind, body and soul 
In part, and in whole 
Because to someone, somewhere, oh yeah ... 
Alma matters 
In mind, body and soul 
In part, and in whole 
To someone, somewhere, oh yeah ... 
Alma matters 
In mind, body and soul 
Part, and in whole 
So to someone, somewhere, oh yeah ... 
Alma matters 
In mind, body and soul 
Part, and in whole 
To someone, somewhere, oh yeah ... 
Oh yeah ... Oh yeah, oh yeah Oh yeah ...

 

AMBITIOUS OUTSIDERS

Bolt-lock your doors 
Alarm your cars 
And still we move in closer 
Every day 
Top of the list 
Is your smiling kids 
But we'll be smiling too 
So that's OK 
Oh, and by the way 
Thank you, because you're 
Giving, giving, giving 
And we're receiving - 
No, no, we're taking 
Keeping the population down 
Your taxes paid, but 
Police waylaid 
And we knows 
When the school bus 
Comes and goes 
We're on your street, but 
You don't see us 
Or, if you do 
You smile and say Hello 
BUT DON'T UNDERESTIMATE US 
When you are 
Giving, giving, giving 
And we're receiving - 
No, no, we're taking 
Just keeping 
The population down 
You're giving, giving, giving 
Well, it's your own fault 
For reproducing 
We're just keeping 
The population down

 

TROUBLE LOVES ME

Trouble loves me 
Trouble needs me 
Two things 
More than you do 
Or would attempt to 
So, console me 
Otherwise, hold me 
Just when it seems like 
Everything's evened out 
And the balance 
Seems serene 
Trouble loves me 
Walks beside me 
To chide me 
Not to guide me 
It's still much more 
Than you'll do 
So, console me 
Otherwise, hold me 
Just when it seems like 
Everything's evened out 
And the balance seems serene 
See the fool I'll be 
Still running 'round 
On the flesh rampage 
Still running 'round 
Ready with ready-wit 
Still running 'round 
On the flesh rampage 
- At your age ! 
Go to Soho, oh 
Go to waste in 
The wrong arms 
Still running 'round 
Trouble loves me 
Seeks and finds me 
To charlatanize me 
Which is only 
As it should be 
Oh, please fulfill me 
Otherwise, kill me 
Show me a barrel and watch me scrape it 
Faced with the music, as always I'll face it 
In the half-light 
So English, frowning 
Then at midnight I 
Can't get you out of my head 
A disenchanted taste 
Still running 'round 
A disenchanted taste 
Still running 'round

 

PAPA JACK

Papa Jack 
Wants to turn 
Back the clock 
And reach out 
To the kids 
He once had 
Who have flown 
Papa Jack 
In decline 
Feels inclined 
To reach out 
To the kids 
He once had 
Who have flown 
But there was a time 
When the kids reached up 
And Papa Jack just 
Pushed them away 
Looking deep 
In his heart 
Papa Jack 
Doesn't like 
What he sees 
Or the time 
On his hands 
The dying day 
The chilly sun 
Papa Jack 
All alone 
Sings slow 
Grieving and low 
But there was a time 
When the kids reached up 
Now you can't always 
Have it your way 
Papa Jack 
Ah ...

 

AMMUNITION

I know these roads 
Each ridge 
And narrow bridge 
Each cheveron 
Enticing me on 
Each warning sign 
I take in my stride 
I don't need more ammunition 
I've got more than I can spend 
I don't dwell on things I'm missing 
I'm just pleased 
With the things I've found 
I know these roads 
An old hand understands 
Above all, I know what's 
Expected of me now 
Veering cliffwards 
I don't need more ammunition 
I've got more than I can spend 
I don't dwell on things I'm missing 
I'm just pleased 
With the things I've found 
With the things I've found 
With the things I've found 
I've found 
I've been crying 
It comes back on these salient days 
And it stays 
And it says : 
"We've never really been away" 
I don't need more ammunition 
I've got more than I can spend 
I don't think of who I'm missing 
I've got no space and no time 
In my life, anymore 
No space or time 
In my life, anymore 
For Revenge

 

WIDE TO RECEIVE

Download something 
Useful, or useless 
Because I'm lying here 
Wide to receive 
Almost anything 
You'd care to give 
And I don't 
Get along with myself 
And I'm not too keen 
On anyone else 
Turn on, plug in 
Then just walk away 
Unlock, process 
And then just go 
And I've never felt quite so alone 
As I do right now 
I'm lying here 
Wide to receive 
Almost anything 
You'd care to leave 
Wide, wide, wide Wide, wide, wide...

 

ROY'S KEEN

(GO ON !)
He's romancing you 
And chancing his arm 
He'll be here 
Smiling on time 
He's romancing you 
And chancing his arm 
He'll be here 
Smiling on time 
Roy's keen oh Roy's keen 
Roy's keen oh Roy's keen 
We've never seen a 
Keener window-cleaner 
Back up the ladder 
Into each corner 
Dunking the chamois 
Just think of the goodwill 
The ladder's a planet 
Roy is a star, and 
I am a satellite 
(But that's alright) 
He can hold a smile for as long 
As you require (even longer) 
He can hold a smile for as long 
As you require (even longer) 
Roy's keen oh Roy's keen 
Roy's keen oh Roy's keen 
We've never seen a 
Keener window-cleaner 
Back up the ladder 
Into each corner 
Dunking the chamois 
Just think of the goodwill 
The ladder's a planet 
Roy is a star, and 
I am a satellite 
I will be set alight 
Don't say you'll hold it steady 
Then you let it go 
Don't say you'll hold it steady 
Then you let it go Oh ...
You're up the ladder 
Into each corner 
Foot in a bucket 
We trust you to wreck it 
Even when it's under your nose 
Well, you just can't 
See it, can you ? 
Well, it's here 
Right under your nose 
And you just can't 
See it, can you? La la la la ...
Roy's keen, Roy's keen La la la la ...
We've never seen a 
Keener window-cleaner 
Oh ... La la la la ...

 

HE CRIED

I need you 
Simple words 
But words which had never been heard 
By the soul 
Stoned to death 
But still living 
And so he froze where he stood 
And he looked to the ground 
And he cried 
He cried 
Ride our minds 
If you must 
But there's always a line you don't cross 
Time is short 
Don't be cruel 
Oh you don't know the power 
In what you're saying 
Oh ... 
And so he froze where he stood 
And he looked to the ground 
And he cried 
He cried 
People where 
I come from 
They survive without feelings or blood 
I never could 
Was stoned to death 
But I'm still living 
So he froze where he stood 
And he looked to the ground 
And he cried 
He cried 
So he froze 
And he looked, and he looked 
To the ground 
And he cried 
He cried

 

SORROW WILL COME IN THE END

Legalized theft 
Leaves me bereft 
I get it straight in the neck 
(Somehow expecting no less) 
A court of justice 
With no use for Truth 
Lawyer ...liar 
Lawyer ...liar 
You pleaded and squealed 
And you think you've won 
But Sorrow will come 
To you in the end 
And as sure as my words are pure 
I praise the day that brings you pain 
Q.C.'s obsessed with sleaze 
Frantic for Fame 
They're all on the game 
They just use a different name 
You lied 
And you were believed 
By a J.P. senile and vile 
You pleaded and squealed 
And you think you've won 
But Sorrow will come 
To you in the end 
And as sure as my words are pure 
I praise the day that brings you pain 
So don't close your eyes 
Don't close your eyes 
A man who slits throats 
Has time on his hands 
And I'm gonna get you 
So don't close your eyes 
Don't ever close your eyes 
You think you've won 
OH NO

 

SATAN REJECTED MY SOUL

Satan rejected my soul 
He knows my kind 
He won't be dragged down 
He's seen my face around 
He knows Heaven doesn't seem 
To be my home 
So I must find 
Somewhere else to go 
So I must find 
Somewhere else to go 
So, take it - please 
It's free 
You'll never see 
You'll never see 
All the fun in life it's cost me 
Satan rejected my soul 
As low as he goes 
He never quite goes this low 
He's seen my face around 
He knows Heaven doesn't seem 
To be my home 
So I must find 
Somewhere else to go 
So I must find 
Somewhere else to go 
So, take it please 
It's really sly 
Come on, come on, ah Come on, come on, come on 
Take it please, It's really sly 
Come on, come on, ah Come on, come on, come on 
Call me in, Pull me in, call me in 
Come on, come on, oh Come on, come on, come on 
Pull me in, pull me in, Call me in, haul me in, pull me in 
Come on, come on, ah, Come on, come on 
La la la la la, Oh ...
