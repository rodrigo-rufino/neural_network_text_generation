1917

(David Bowie/Reeves Gabrels)




1984

 

Someday they won't let you, now you must agree
The times they are a telling, and the changing isn't free
You've read it in the tea leaves, and the tracks are on TV
Beware the savage lure
Of 1984

They'll split your pretty cranium and fill it full of air
And tell that you're eighty, but brother you won't care
You'll be shooting up on anything, tomorrow's never there
Beware the savage lure
Of 1984

(Chorus)
  Come see, come see, remember me?
  We played out an all night movie role
  You said it would last, but I guess we enrolled
  In 1984 (who could ask for more)
  1984 (who could ask for mor-or-or-or-ore)
  (Mor-or-or-or-ore)

I'm looking for a vehicle, I'm looking for a ride
I'm looking for a party, I'm looking for a side
I'm looking for the treason that I knew in '65
Beware the savage lure
Of 1984

(Chorus)

1984
1984
1984 (more)
1984
1984 (more)
1984

(Recorded during the Diamond Dogs sessions at the Olympic Studios, Barnes, London SW13 in 1974).





1984/Dodo

 

Someday they won't let you, but now you must agree
The times they are a telling, and the changing isn't free
You've read it in the tea leaves, the tracks are on TV
Beware the savage lure
Of 1984

They'll break your pretty cranium, and fill it full of air
And tell you that you're eighty, but lover you won't care
You'll be shooting up as usual like tomorrow wasn't there
Beware the savage lure
Of 1984

Come see, come see, remember me?
We played at an all night movie role
You said it would last, but I guess we rolled
In 1984 (who could ask for more)
1984 (who could ask for more)

Now we can talk in confidence
Did you guess that we've been done wrong?
Lies jump in queue to be first in line
Such a shameless design

He thinks he's well screened from the man at the top
It's a shame that his children disagree
They coolly decide to sell him down the line
Daddy's brainwashing time

He's a dodo, no no, didn't hear it from me (didn't hear it from me)
He's a dodo, no no, didn't hear it from me (didn't hear it from me)

She's doesn't recall her blessed childhood of yore
When a unit was a figure, not a she
When lovers chose each other seems the perks are due
Another memo to screw

She's a dodo, no no, didn't hear it from me (didn't hear it from me)
She's a dodo, no no, didn't hear it from me (didn't hear it from me)

Can you wipe your nose my child
Without them slotting in your file a photograph?
Will you sleep in fear tonight?
Wake to find the scorching light of neighbour Jim
He's come to turn you in

Another dodo, no no, didn't hear it from me (didn't hear it from me)
Another dodo, no no, didn't hear it from me (didn't hear it from me)
Another dodo, no no, didn't hear it from me (didn't hear it from me)

Come see, come see, remember me?
We played at an all night movie role
You said it would last, but I guess we enrolled
In 1984, who could ask for more
1984, who could ask for mor-or-or-or-ore
Mor-or-or-or-ore

1984
1984 (who could ask for more)
1984
1984 (who could ask for more)
1984
1984 (who could ask for more)
1984
Ooooo

(Recorded during the Diamond Dogs sessions at the Olympic Studios, Barnes, London SW13 in 1974. Several versions recorded including duet with Lulu. The Ryko release had Lulu's vocals removed).





5:15 The Angels Have Gone

 

5:15
I'm changing trains, this little town
Let me down
This foreign rain brings me down
5:15
Train overdue, angels have gone
No ticket
I'm jumping tracks, I'm changing towns
We never talk anymore
Forever I will adore only you

5:15
All of my life, angels have gone
I'm changing trains
Angels like them, thin on the ground
All of my life
All legs and wings, strange sandy eyes

5:15
Train overdue, angels have gone
We never talk anymore
Forever
I will adore only you
Cold station
All of my life
Forever
I'm out of here forever




'87 And Cry

 

It's just a one dollar secret
A lover's secrets in the UK
Torn apart in the UK
In the dribble of May Day
'87 and cry
'87 and cry
And there's nothing inside
And there's nothing in mind, no-oh
And only you
Rocket on thru' the sky
Well it couldn't be done without dogs
And it couldn't be once without us
'87 and cry
'87 and cry

When the days were the days were the days boys
When blue ties were for the big guys
Frannie dressing down for the enemy
You saw him hangin' on the enemy
And there's no one in love
And there's nowhere to scream, no-oh
And only you
Race on to wonder where
Well it couldn't be done without dogs
No it couldn't be once without us
'87 and cry
'87 and cry
You can't make love with money
You can't make mistakes with babies
Nothing looked good on you
That's how I liked you best
Now you're ready for the real McCoy

Deep in the heart of Cupid
Murder on the heels of love
Just the ghost of a story
It's just a one dollar secret
   Baby these were the sounds
   Baby these were the sounds, yeah
And only you
Whisper these things aren't true
But it couldn't be done with dogs
Well it couldn't be once without us
('87 and cry)
'87 and cry
'87 and cry
'87 and cry, cry, cry
'87 and cry
'87 and cry, cry, cry
'87 and cry
'87 and cry, cry, cry, cry, cry
'87 and cry, cry, cry, cry
'87 and cry
'87 and cry
'87 and cry
'87 and cry
Hey, hey
'87 and cry




A Better Future

 

Please don't tear this world asunder
Please take back this fear we're under
I demand a better future
Or I might just stop wanting you
I might just stop wanting you

Please make sure we get tomorrow
All this pain and all this sorrow
I demand a better future
Or I might just stop needing you
I might just stop needing you

Give my children sunny smiles
Give them room and cloudless skies
I demand a better future
Or I might just stop loving you, loving you, loving you

When we talk, we talk to you
When we walk, we walk to you
From factory to field
How many tears must fall?
Down there below
Nothing is moving

I might just stop wanting you
I might just stop needing you
I might just stop loving you
I demand a better future
I demand a better future
I demand a better future
Or I might just stop loving you
Loving you, loving you

I demand a better future
I demand a better future
I demand a better future
Or I might just stop loving you
Loving you, loving you
I demand a better future




A Big Hurt

 

For Michelle

To meet her once just to know it through and through
I know, I know
But it ain't finished till the fat lady sings
I know, I know

How can I help you?
You're just a wanna-be
I'm a believer
You're a sex receiver
And me with a big hurt
You know I had a big hurt
From the very start
I'm hurting so bad
'Cos you're my room mate from hell

(Chorus)
  Got to take some blows on the stepping stones
  Speak in extremes
  It'll save you time
  You were a Saint abroad
  But a devil at home
  Come on here, woo-woo
  And kiss it for me

To meet her once is just to know it through and through
I know, I know
Even a glass eye in a duck's ass can see that
I know, I know

How can I help you?
I'm hit with a big hurt
You know I had
A great big hurt
From the very start
I'm hurting so bad
And here come the Indians oooo!

(Chorus)

Kiss it for me, woo-woo
Kiss it for me
Woo-woo, kiss it for me
Come on here, woo-woo
Kiss it for me
Kiss it where it counts
Kiss it for me
Come on here, woo-woo
Woo-woo, woo-woo, woo-woo, woo-woo
Kiss it for me

I know




A New Career In A New Town

 



(Recorded during the Low sessions at The Chateau, Paris, France and Hansa Tonstudio, Berlin, Germany in 1976-1977).





A Small Plot Of Land

(Lyrics: David Bowie. Music: Bowie/Eno/Gabrels/Garson/Kizilcay/Campbell)

Poor soul
Spit upon that
Poor soul
He never knew what hit him
And it hit him so

Poor dunce
He pushed at the pigmen
The Barbs laughed
The fool is dead

Poor dunce
He's less than within us
The brains talk
But the will to live is dead
And prayer can't travel so far these days
The talk of your life
Standing so near
To innocent eyes
Poor dunce

Swings through the tunnels
And claws his way
Is small life so manic
Are these really the days?

Poor dunce
Poor dunce

Poor soul
Spit upon that
Poor soul
He never knew what hit him
And it hit him so
He pushed back the pigmen
Poor soul
Poor soul
Poor soul
Poor soul
Poor, poor soul
Poor, poor, poor (etc)




Abdulmajid





(Recorded during the "Heroes" sessions at Hansa Tonstudio, Berlin, Germany in 1977. Previously untitled until Ryko release, Abdulmajid is Iman's maiden name).





Absolute Beginners

 

I've nothing much to offer
There's nothing much to take
I'm an absolute beginner
But I'm absolutely sane
As long as we're together
The rest can go to hell
I absolutely love you
But we're absolute beginners
With eyes completely open
But nervous all the same

(Chorus)
  If our love song
  Could fly over mountains
  Could laugh at the ocean
  Just like the films
  There's no reason
  To feel all the hard times
  To lay down the hard lines
  It's absolutely true

Nothing much could happen
Nothing we can't shake
Though we're absolute beginners
With nothing much at stake
As long as you're still smiling
There's nothing more I need
I absolutely love you
But we're absolute beginners
Well if my love is your love
We're certain to succeed

(Chorus)
  If our love song
  Could fly over mountains
  Could sail over heartache
  Just like the films
  If there's reason
  To feel all the hard times
  To lay down the hard lines
  It's absolutely true





Across The Universe

(John Lennon/Paul McCartney)

Words are flowing out like endless rain into a paper cup
They slither wildly as they slip away
Across the universe
Pools of sorrow, waves of joy are drifting through my opened mind
Possessing and caressing me

(Chorus 1 - 2 times)
  Nothing's gonna change my world
  Nothing's gonna change my world

Images of broken light which dance before me like a million eyes
They call me on and on
Across the universe
Thoughts meander like the restless wind inside a letter box
They tumble blindly as they make their way
Across the universe

CHORUS 1 (twice)

Sounds of laughter, shades of life are ringing through my open ears
Inciting and inviting me
Limitless undying love, which shines around me like a million suns
It calls me on and on and on
Across the universe

(Chorus 1 - 3 times)

(Chorus 2 - 2 times)
  Nothing
  Nothing
  Nothing
  Nothing's gonna
  Nothing's gonna to change my world

(Chorus 3)
  Nothing's gonna change it
  Nothing's gonna change it

Hey

(Chorus 3 - 2 times)

Nothing's gonna change my world

(Chorus 3)

Nothing's gonna change my world




Afraid

 

I wish I was smarter
I got so lost on the shore
I wish I was taller
Things really matter to me

But I put my face in tomorrow
I believe we're not alone
I believe in Beatles
I believe my little soul has grown
And I'm still so afraid
Yes, I'm still so afraid
Yea, I'm still so afraid on my own
On my own

What made my life so wonderful?
What made me feel so bad?
I used to wake up the ocean
I used to walk on clouds

If I put faith in medication
If I can smile a crooked smile
If I can talk on television
If I can walk an empty mile
Then I won't feel afraid
No, I won't feel afraid
I won't be
Be afraid
Anymore




African Night Flight

(Lyrics: David Bowie. Music: David Bowie/Brian Eno)

African nightmare one-time Mormon
More men fall in Hullabaloo men
I slide to the nearest bar
Undermine chairman I went too far
Bent on a windfall rent a Sony
Wonder how the dollar went down?
Gotta get a word to Elizabeth's father
Hey ho, he wished me well

CHORUS 1 (two times)
  Seemed like another day
  I could fly into the eye of God on high

CHORUS 2 (two times)
  His burning eye will see me through
  One of these days, one of these days
  Gotta get a word through one of these days

CHORUS 3 (two times)
  Asanti habari habari habari
  Asanti nabana nabana nabana

Getting in mood for a Mombassa night flight
Pushing my luck, gonna fly like a mad thing
Bare strip take-off skimming over Rhino
Born in slumber less than peace
Struggle with a child whose screaming dreaming
Drowned by the props all steely sunshine
Sick of you, sick of me
Lust for the free life
Quashed and maimed
Like a valuable loved one
Left unnamed

CHORUS 1 (two times)

Over the bushland over the trees
Wise like Orangutan that was me

CHORUS 2 (two times)

CHORUS 3 (repeat ad inf.)

(Recorded during the Lodger sessions at Mountain Studios, Montreux, Switzerland in 1979).





After All

 

Please trip them gently, they don't like to fall, Oh by jingo
There's no room for anger, we're all very small, Oh by jingo
We're painting our faces and dressing in thoughts from the skies, from paradise
But they think that we're holding a secretive ball
Won't someone invite them
They're just taller children, that's all, after all

Man is an obstacle, sad as the clown, Oh by jingo
So hold on to nothing, and he won't let you down, Oh by jingo
Some people are marching together and some on their own
Quite alone
Others are running, the smaller ones crawl
But some sit in silence, they're just older children
That's all, after all

I sing with impertinence, shading impermanent chords
With my words
I've borrowed your time and I'm sorry I called
But the thought just occurred that we're nobody's children at all, after all

Live till your rebirth and do what you will, Oh by jingo
Forget all I've said, please bear me no ill, Oh by jingo
After all, after all




After Today

 

Always in trouble
Never to blame
Must be your double
Feeling the same
Here it comes again

Doing the wrong thing
Forgetting your lines
Waiting for something
Better to shine
Hate that same old game

After today - fortune then will find you
After today - plane will fly you away
After today - you'll find the one you're after
After today - look out, after today

What kind of rescue?
What will you be?
Where can you take it baby for free?
Break that heart for me!

(Chorus)
  After today - the fortune fan will find you
  After today - they may pry you away
  After today - you'll find the one you're after
  After today - look out, after today

(Chorus)
  After today - the fortune fan will find you
  After today - they will pry you away
  After today - you'll find the one you're after
  After today - look out, after today

Today
After today
After today, hey
Look out, after today
Ah, yeah
Look, ah (laughter)
(Spoken: "I was getting into that")

Aladdin Sane (1913-1938-197?)

 

Watching him dash away, swinging an old bouquet - dead roses
Sake and strange divine
Uh-h-h-uh-h-uh you'll make it
Passionate bright young things, takes him away to war - don't fake it
Saddening glissando strings
Uh-h-h-uh-h-uh - you'll make it

Who will love Aladdin Sane
Battle cries and champagne just in time for sunrise
Who will love Aladdin Sane

Motor sensational, Paris or maybe hell - I'm waiting
Clutches of sad remain
Waits for Aladdin Sane - you'll make it

Who will love Aladdin Sane
Millions weep a fountain, just in case of sunrise
Who will love Aladdin Sane

Will love Aladdin Sane
Who'll love Aladdin Sane

Who will love Aladdin Sane
Millions weep a fountain, just in case of sunrise
Who will love Aladdin Sane

Will love Aladdin Sane
Will love Aladdin Sane

Say the lights are oh so bright on Broadway




Algeria Touchshriek

(Lyrics: David Bowie. Music: Bowie/Gabrels/Garson/Kizilcay/Campbell)

My name is Mr. Touchshriek
Of Touchshriek with mail over and fantasy
My shop sells egg shells off the shesores and empty females

I'm thinking of leasing the room above my shop
To a Mr. Walloff Domburg
A reject from the world wide intellect

He's a broken man
I'm also a broken man

It would be nice to have company
We could have great conversations
Looking through windows for demons
And watching the young advance in all electric

Some of the houses around here still have inhabitants in them
I'm not sure if they're from this country or not
I don't get to speak much to anyone or, that sort of thing
If I had another broken man
Oh, I dream of something like that




All Saints








All The Madmen

 

Day after day
They send my friends away
To mansions cold and grey
To the far side of town
Where the thin men stalk the streets
While the sane stay underground

Day after day
They tell me I can go
They tell me I can blow
To the far side of town
Where it's pointless to be high
'Cos it's such a long way down

So I tell them that
I can fly, I will scream, I will break my arm
I will do me harm
Here I stand, foot in hand, talking to my wall
I'm not quite right at all... am I?

Don't set me free, I'm as heavy as can be
Just my librium and me
And my E.S.T. makes three

'Cos I'd rather stay here
With all the madmen
Than perish with the sad men roaming free
And I'd rather play here
With all the madmen
For I'm quite content they're all as sane
As me

(Where can the horizon lie
When a nation hides
Its organic minds
In a cellar...dark and grim
They must be very dim)

Day after day
They take some brain away
Then turn my face around
To the far side of town
And tell me that it's real
Then ask me how I feel

Here I stand, foot in hand, talking to my wall
I'm not quite right at all

Don't set me free, I'm as helpless as can be
My libido's split on me
Gimme some good old lobotomy

'Cos I'd rather stay here
With all the madmen
Than perish with the sad men
Roaming free
And I'd rather play here
With all the madmen
For I'm quite content
They're all as sane as me

Zane, Zane, Zane
Ouvre le Chien    (repeat)

Almost Grown

(Chuck Berry)

Yeah 'n' I'm doin' all right in school
They ain't said I broke no rule
I ain't never been in Dutch
I don't browse around too much

Don't bother me, leave me alone
Anyway I'm almost grown

I don't run around with no mob
Got myself a little job
I'm gonna buy me a little car
Drive my girl in the park

Got my eye on a little girl
Ah, she's really out of this world
When I take her to the dance
She's got to talk about romance

You know I'm still livin' in town
But I done married and settled down
Now I really have a ball
So I don't browse around at all




Always Crashing In The Same Car

 

Every chance, every chance that I take
I'll take it on the road
With kilometers and the red light
I was always looking left and right
Oh, but ?
Always crashing in the same car

Jasmine, I saw you peeping
As I pushed my foot down to the floor
I was going, round and round, the hotel garage
Must have been touching close to ninety-four
Oh, but I'm always crashing in the same car

Yeah

(Recorded during the Low sessions at The Chateau, Paris, France and Hansa Tonstudio, Berlin, Germany in 1976-1977).





Amazing

(David Bowie/Reeves Gabrels)

I'm lazy
You crazy, girl
Stay by my side

I'm scared you'll
Meet someone
In whom you'll confide
No, no, no

CHORUS
  Life's still a dream
  Your love's amazing
  Since I found you
  My life's amazing

I pledge you'll
Never be blue
There's too much at stake to be down
My nightmare
Rooted here watching you go
Divine in both our lives

  Life's still a dream
  Your love's amazing
  Amazing
  Since I found you
  My life's a roll

Go, go, go
And it's amazing
It's amazing
Go, go, go
It's amazing
Ow, ow, ow
Go, go, go
Ow, ow
It's amazing




America

(Paul Simon)

"Let us be lovers we'll marry our fortunes together"
"I've got some real estate here in my bag"
So we bought a pack of cigarettes, Mrs. Wagner pies
Walked off to look for America

"Kathy," I said as we boarded a Greyhound in Pittsburgh
"Michigan seems like a dream to me now"
It took me four days to hitch-hike from Saginaw
I've gone to look for America

Laughing on the bus
Playing games with the faces
She said the man in the gabardine suit was a spy
I said "Be careful his bow tie is really a camera"

"Toss me a cigarette, I think there's one in my raincoat"
She said "We smoked the last one an hour ago"
So I gazed at the scenery, she read her magazine
And the moon rose over an open field

"Kathy I'm lost" I said, though I knew she was sleeping
I'm empty and aching and I don't know why
Counting the cars on the New Jersey Turnpike
They've all come to look for America
They've all come to look for America
All come to look for America


(First song of the 'Concert for New York City' benefit gig in New York City at Madison Square Garden on 20th October 2001).





Amlapura

(David Bowie/Reeves Gabrels)

(Also version done in Indonesian)

Hey-hey it's the tall sail
On a beach reach for Java
Make way for to Java
Watching for Boogies
Hey-hey it's a dreaming
I would burn you if you should die
Hey-hey I would burn too
If you should lie upon that bamboo pyre

CHORUS
  I dream of Amlapura
  Never saw in all my life a more shining jewel
  I dream of Amlapura
  Of an ocean or dream of a Princess in stone

Hey-hey golden roses around
A Rajah's mouth
Hey-hey all the dead children buried standing
A flying Dutchman
Smoking gun and spice wind

CHORUS

I dream of Amlapura
Of a Princess in stone
Hey-hey it's a tall ship
Hey-hey
Hey-hey
Amlapura




Amlapura - (Indonesian version)

(David Bowie/Reeves Gabrels. Translated: ?)

Hey, hey, ada kapal layar
Menuju Jawa
Dari jalan ke Jawa jaga-jaga
Jika ada orang Bugis

Hey, hey, ini mimpi
Kukan bakarmu jika kau harus pergi
Hey, hey, kubakan
Maka diriku
Jika kau baring di balai bambu

Kumimpi tentang Amlapura
Tak pernah kulihat permata seindah ini
Kumimpi tentang Amlapura
Lautan atau mimpi
Tentang patung putri

Hey, hey, patung raja
Dikalungi mawar emas
Hey, hey, kanak-kanak, tewas di tempat
Oleh bedil-Belanda
Dari kapal letaknya

Kumimpi tentang Amlapura
Tak pernah kulihat permata seindah ini
Kumimpi tentang Amlapura
Lautan atau mimpi
Tentang patung putri

Kumimpi tentang Amlapura
Tentang patung putri

Hey, hey, ada kapal layar

Kumimpi tentang Amlapura
Atas deknya dan kapal tempatnya
Dari jalan ke Jawa
Dari jalan ke Jawa




Amsterdam

(Jacques Brel/Mort Schumann)

In the port of Amsterdam
There's a sailor who sings
Of the dreams that he brings
From the wide open sea
In the port of Amsterdam
There's a sailor who sleeps
While the river bank weeps
To the old Willow tree

In the port of Amsterdam
There's a sailor who dies
Full of beer, full of cries
In a drunken town fight
In the port of Amsterdam
There's a sailor who's born
On a hot muggy morn
By the dawn's early light

In the port of Amsterdam
Where the sailors all meet
There's a sailor who eats
Only fish heads and tails
And he'd show you his teeth
That have rotted too soon
That can haul up the sails
That can swallow the moon

And he yells to the cook
With his arms open wide
"Hey, bring me more fish
Throw it down by my side"
And he wants so to belch
But he's too full to try
So he stands up and laughs
And he zips up his fly

In the port of Amsterdam
You can see sailors dance
Paunches bursting their pants
Grinding women to porch
They've forgotten the tune
That their whiskey voice croaked
Splitting the night
With the roar of their jokes
And they turn and they dance
And they laugh and they lust
Till the rancid sound of the accordion bursts
And then out of the night
With their pride in their pants
And the snot that they tow
Underneath the street lamp

In the port of Amsterdam
There's a sailor who drinks
And he drinks and he drinks
And he drinks once again
He'll drink to the health
Of the whores of Amsterdam
Who've given their bodies
To a thousand other men
Yeah, they've bargained their virtue
Their goodness all gone
For a few dirty coins
When he just can't go on
Throws his nose to the sky
Aims it up above
And he pisses like I cry
On the unfaithful love

In the port of Amsterdam
In the port of Amsterdam




An Occasional Dream - (demo)

 

I recall how we lived
On the corner of the bed
And we'd speak of a Swedish room
Of hessian and wood
And we'd talk with our eyes
Of the sweetness in our lives
And tomorrow's of rich surprise
Some things we could do
For you and me tomorrow

In our madness
We burnt one hundred days
Time takes time to pass
And I still hold some ashes to me
An occasional dream

And we'd sleep, oh so close
But not really close our eyes
'Tween the sheets of Summer bathed in blue
Gently weeping nights
It was long, long ago, long ago
And I still can't touch your name

For the days of fate were strong for you
Danced you far from me
Just you and you tomorrow

In my madness
I see your face in mine
I keep a photograph
It burns my wall with time
Time
An occasional dream
Of mine
An occasional dream
Of mine
An occasional dream
Of mine

(Appears on a demo tape recorded by David Bowie and John 'Hutch' Hutchinson in April 1969).

And I Say To Myself

 

And I say to myself
I've got it wrong, wrong, wrong
She is a playgirl
She the wrong wrong girl for me
And I say to myself
You're a fool, fool, fool
She doesn't love you
She doesn't need you, this I know

She's got a trail of men that she takes
Wherever she goes
She hasn't the strength to love any single man for a length of time

(And I say to myself)
Ooh, I don't stand a chance
(And I say to myself)
It's a long long romance

(And I say to myself)
Oh yeah, oh yeah

Oh yeah

And I say to myself that she shouldn't love anybody else in the world but me
And I say to myself
Forget her now, now, now
She don't want you
She don't love you anymore
And I say to myself you're a fool, fool, fool
She's don't love you
She don't need you, this I know

And I turn around and look at myself
You'll never get her, you're a fool
Say after me I'm a fool - I'm a fool

(And I say to myself)
I can't get what I want
(And I say to myself)
And it makes me sad
(And I say to myself)
I can't get what I want
(And I say to myself)
And it makes me mad

That I love her
(And I say to myself)
And I say to myself that I need her

Andy Warhol

 

Like to take a cement fix
Be a standing cinema
Dress my friends up just for show
See them as they really are
Put a peephole in my brain
Two new pence to have a go
I'd like to be a gallery
Put you all inside my show

CHORUS
  Andy Warhol looks a scream
  Hang him on my wall
  Andy Warhol, silver screen
  Can't tell them apart at all

Andy walking, Andy tired
Andy take a little snooze
Tie him up when he('s) fast asleep
Send him on a pleasant cruise
When he wake up on the sea
Be sure to think of me and you
He'll think about paint and he'll think about glue
What a jolly boring thing to do

  Andy Warhol looks a scream
  Hang him on my wall
  Andy Warhol, silver screen
  Can't tell them apart at all

(Chorus repeat)




Angel, Angel, Grubby Face

 

(Partial lyrics)

It's thirteen miles to Factory Street, the train is going soon
Angel, angel, grubby face, I love you, do you love me?
Sunday Oak tree, sing me a song
The cobbles of town are lost in your branches
Monday morning, buses and smoke, workshop and counter, disorder and vouchers

(Believed to have been recorded in March 1968. The demo appeared on the reverse side of a 'London Bye, Ta Ta' EMIDISC acetate, which was offered for sale at Christie's auction house in 1993).





Anyway, Anyhow, Anywhere

(Pete Townsend/Roger Daltrey)

CHORUS
  I can go anyway (way I choose)
  I can live anyhow (win or lose)
  I can go anywhere (for something new)
  Anyway, anyhow, anywhere I choose

Do anything (right or wrong)
I can talk anyhow (and get along)
I don't care anyway (I never lose)
Anyway, anyhow, anywhere I choose

Nothing gets in my way
Not even locked doors
Don't follow the lines that been laid before
I get along anyway I care
Anyway, anyhow, anywhere

CHORUS
  I can go anyway (way I choose)
  I can live anyhow (win or lose)
  I can do anything (for something new)
  Anyway, anyhow, anywhere I choose

Anyway, anyway I choose
I wanna go
Do it myself, do it myself, do it myself, do it myself
Anyway, anyway I choose




Are You Coming, Are You Coming?

 

 

(Believed originally intended for David's proposed 1973 stage version of 'Nineteen Eighty-Four' which was aborted after George Orwell's widow Sonia Blair refused permission).





Art Decade

 



(Recorded during the Low sessions at The Chateau, Paris, France and Hansa Tonstudio, Berlin, Germany in 1976-1977).





As The World Falls Down

 

There's such a sad love
Deep in your eyes, a kind of pale jewel
Open and closed within your eyes
I'll place the sky within your eyes

There's such a fooled heart
Beating so fast in search of new dreams
A love that will last within your heart
I'll place the moon within your heart

CHORUS
  As the pain sweeps through
  Makes no sense for you
  Every thrill has gone
  Wasn't too much fun at all
  But I'll be there for you-oo-oo
  As the world falls down

Falling
(As the world) Falling down
Falling in love

I'll paint you mornings of gold
I'll spin you Valentine evenings
Though we're strangers till now
We're choosing a path between the stars
I'll leave my love between the stars

CHORUS

Falling
(As the world) Falling down
Falling
As the world falls down
Falling
Falling
Falling
Falling in love
As the world falls down
(down) Falling
Falling
Falling
Falling in love
As the world falls down

Falling
Falling
Falling

Makes no sense at all
Makes no sense to fall
Falling
As the world falls down
Falling
Falling
Falling in love
As the world falls down
(down) Falling
Falling
Falling in love
Falling in love (love)
Falling in love
Falling in love
Falling in love




Ashes To Ashes

 

Do you remember a guy that's been
In such an early song
I've heard a rumour from Ground Control
Oh no, don't say it's true

They got a message from the Action Man
"I'm happy, hope you're happy too
I've loved all I've needed love
Sordid details following"

The shrieking of nothing is killing
Just pictures of Jap girls in synthesis
And I ain't got no money and I ain't got no hair
But I'm hoping to kick but the planet is glowing

  Ashes to ashes, funk to funky
  We know Major Tom's a junky
  Strung out in heaven's high
  Hitting an all-time low

Time and again I'll tell myself
I'll stay clean tonight
But the little green wheels are following me
Oh no, not again
"I'm stuck with a valuable friend
I'm happy, hope you're happy too"
One flash of light but no smoking pistol

I've never done good things
I've never done bad things
I never did anything out of the blue, woh-o-oh
Want an axe to break the ice
Wanna come down right now

  Ashes to ashes, funk to funky
  We know Major Tom's a junky
  Strung out in heaven's high
  Hitting an all-time low

My mama said to get things done
You'd better not mess with Major Tom
My mama said to get things done
You'd better not mess with Major Tom
My mama said to get things done
You'd better not mess with Major Tom
My mama said to get things done
You'd better not mess with Major Tom




Baal's Hymn

(Bertolt Brecht. Translation: Dominic Muldowney)

Whilst his mother's womb contained the growing Baal
Even then the sky was waiting quiet and pale
Naked, young, immensely marvellous
Like Baal loved it, when he came to us

That same sky remained with him in joy and care
Even when Baal slept peaceful and unaware
At night a lilac sky, a drunken Baal
Turning pious as the sky grows pale

So through hospital, cathedral, whiskey bar
Baal kept moving onwards and just let things go
When Baal's tired, boys, Baal cannot fall far
He will have his sky down there below

When the sinners congregate in shame together
Baal lay naked, revelling in their distress
Only sky, a sky that will go on forever
Formed a blanket for his nakedness

And that lusty girl, the world, who'll laughing yield
To the men who'll stand the pressure of her thighs
Sometimes gave him love-bites, such as can't be healed
Baal survived it, he just used his eyes

And when Baal saw lots of corpses scattered round
He felt twice the thrill, despite the lack of room
"Space enough" said Baal, "then I'll thicken the ground
Space enough within this woman's womb"

Any vice for Baal has got its useful side
It's the man who practices it, he can't abide
Vices have their point, once you see it as such
Stick to two for one will be too much

Slackness, softness are the sort of things to shun
Nothing could be harder than the quest for fun
Lots of strength is needed and experience too
Swollen bellies can embarrass you

Under gloomy stars and this poor veil of tears
Baal will graze a pasture till it disappears
Once it's been digested to the forest's teeth
Baal trod singing for a well earned sleep

Baal can spot the vultures in the stormy sky
As they wait up there to see if Baal will die
Sometimes Baal pretends he's dead, but vultures swoop
Baal in silence dines on vulture-soup

When the dark womb drags him down to its prize
What's the world still mean to Baal, he's overfed
So much sky is lurking still behind his eyes
He'll just have enough sky when he's dead

Once the Earth's dark womb engulfed the rotting Baal
Even then the sky was up there, quiet and pale
Naked, young, immensely marvellous
Like Baal loved it when he lived with us

(Recorded for 1982 BBC TV production of Baal).





Baby

(Iggy Pop/David Bowie)

Baby
Don't you cry
Baby
I'll sing you a lullaby

We're walking down the
Street of chance
Where the chance is always
Slim or none
And the intentions unjust

Baby there's nothing to see
I've already been
Down the street of chance

Baby you're so clean
Baby please stay clean
Baby you're so young
Baby please stay young
Baby, don't you cry
Baby, we've already cried




Baby Can Dance

 

I'm rolling out of the ferris wheel
No one looks and no one feels
But the baby can the baby can

The way it feels just feeling you
Holding out and falling out
But the baby can the baby can

CHORUS
  I'm the jumping man
  I'm the jumping man
  But baby can float
  Baby can drown
  Baby can touch her toes
  Toss her hair
  Makes you feel you're going nowhere
  Baby can dance
  Baby can dance
  Baby can walk around the town
  Attract a man and cut him down

I'm the shadow man the jumping jack
The man who can and don't look back
But the baby can the baby can

I'm rolling out of the ferris wheel
No one looks and no one feels
But the baby can the baby can

CHORUS

And the way it feels
I'm feeling you

Every day is far away
Every day, every day
It's over now
It's over now

CHORUS




Baby Grace (A Horrid Cassette)

(Lyrics: David Bowie. Music: Bowie/Gabrels/Garson/Kizilcay/Campbell)

Test, testing, testing
This and, Grace is my name
And.. and I was... erm...
It was like phot... a fading photograph of
A patch, a patchwork quilt.
And they've put me on these
Ramona put me on these interest drugs
So I'm thinking very f..., too, a bit too fast like a brain patch
And, er... they won't let me see anybody
If I want to sometimes and I ask
I can still hear some pop... popular musics
And aftershocks
I feel a bit... (sneeze)
I've been watching a television of um... in the homelands
That's the new homelands, and, erm, and that's all I can remember
And now, they just want me to be quiet
And this I think, something is going to be horrid




Baby It Can't Fall

(Iggy Pop/David Bowie)

You have loved me with energy
Backed up with hard work and guts
We inhabit eternity
We fly forever in space

The way we run together
The way we breeze the miles
We put our heads together
And laughingly we smile

It can't fall
It can't fall
Baby, it can't fall
Death means nothing at all

It can't fall
It can't fall
Baby, it can't fall
Our love will outlive this earth

Words have so many meanings
Sometimes mean nothing at all
Sometimes I feel so simple
I don't know what's coming next

We have swum in the ocean
And that was really alright
I'm not a big man
It's hard to face the world

It can't fall
It can't fall
Baby, it can't fall
Death means nothing at all

It can't fall
It can't fall
Baby, it can't fall
Our love will outlive this earth

It can't fall

Baby Loves That Way (2000 version)

Baby loves that way
Baby loves that way

CHORUS
  Hallo humans can you feel me thinking

  Hallo humans nothing starts tomorrow

No baby, no baby, no baby no

Back To Where You've Never Been

(Tony Hill)

 


(Recorded with Turquoise on 24th October 1968 at Trident Studios. This along with 'Ching-A-Ling' was slated for a release on the Regal Zonophone label in early December 1968).





Ballad Of The Adventurers

(Bertolt Brecht. Translation: Dominic Muldowney)

Sickened by sun, with rainstorms lashing him rotten
A looted wreath crowning his tangled hair
Every moment of his youth apart from its dream was forgotten
Gone the roof overhead, but the sky was always there

Oh you, who are flung out, alike from heaven and from Hades
You murderers who've been so bitterly repaid
Why did you part from the mothers who nursed you as babies
It was peaceful and you slept and there you stayed

Still he explores and rakes the Absinthe green oceans
Though his mother has given him up for lost
Grinning and cursing with a few odd tears of contrition
Always in search of that land where life seems best

Loafing through hells and flocked through paradises
Calm and grinning, with a vanishing face
At times he still dreams of a small field he recognises
With a blue sky overhead and nothing else

(Recorded for 1982 BBC TV production of Baal).





Bang Bang

(Iggy Pop/Ivan Kraal)

(Spoken) 'Now, this ain't the right thing to do... so... so let's... so let's go'

Young girls I know what they're after
Young girls don't kiss me goodbye
Rockets shooting up into space
Buildings they rise to the skies

Bang bang - I got mine
Bang bang - reach for the sky

I keep a good friend on video tape
He'll drive his sports car until it's too late
But we'll have a hot time on the town tonight
'Cause love is my bet and it's the best yet

Bang bang - I got mine
Bang bang - sun don't shine
Bang bang - you all angels
Bang bang - now you all oughta be in pictures

Oh girl
Oh girl my problems can't follow me
Phone calls take my machine
I wander lonely to the sea
Lonely - ha ha ha - what does it mean?

Bang bang - I got mine
Bang bang - and you are next in line
Bang bang - reach for the sky
Bang bang - the sun don't shine

Rise buildings
Rise to the sky
Oh young girls they know what they're after
I said young girls don't kiss me goodbye

Bang bang - then you close them years and clothes - then you close down
Then you're a big man
Bang bang
Spotted a brat
Just coming first
Bang bang
Prayers have wings
Then you were next in line




Bars Of The County Jail

 

La la la la la la la la (etc)
Gather you all and listen here
I'll tell you a tale if you lend me an ear
I rode a horse through many a town
But the Devil rode me down to the ground
I was to marry a very rich girl
I loved her as only I can
But the Father was shot and his gold was stoled
And now I'm the Devil's man, na na na
And now I sing a tail of woe
Through the bars of the county jail, na la la la la la la la la la

La la la la la la la la (etc)

I walked into the room one night
I found her mother and gun
Well, the man was dead and I kneeled and cried
The Sheriff ran in and said "I'm holding you, son"

La la la la la la la la (etc)

Through the day I sing and play
For time is on my side
But when the moon and stars come out
I lay me down and cry
For the Saviour, Ma I lied
Now I will not have a ride
Beside the window the scaffold was made
On the morrow I will hang

La la la la la la la la (etc)

(Demo track recorded in 1965 appears on Early On 1964-1966).





Battle For Britain (The Letter)

(Lyrics: David Bowie. Music: David Bowie/Reeves Gabrels/Mark Plati)

My, my, the time do fly
When it's in another pair of hands
And a loser I will be
For I've never been a winner in my life

I got used to stressing pain
I used the sucker pills to pity for the self
Oh, it's the animal in me
But I'd rather be a beggarman on the shelf

Don't be so forlorn, it's just the payoff
It's the rain before the storm
On a better day, I'll take you by the hand
And I'll walk you through the doors

Don't be so forlorn, it's just the payoff
It's the rain before the storm
Don't you let my letter get you down
Don't you, don't you, don't you, don't you

My, my, but time do fly
When it's in another pair of pants
And illusion I will be
For I've never been a sinner, la di da

Don't be so forlorn, it's just the payoff
It's the rain before the storm
Don't you let my letter get you down
Don't you, don't you, don't you, don't you

Don't you let my letter get you down, down, down, down
Don't you, don't you, don't you, don't you
Don't you let my letter get you down, down, down, down
Don't you, don't you, don't you, don't you

Down, down, down, down, down, down
Down, down, down, down, down, down
Down, down, down, down, down, down




Be My Wife

 

VERSE
  Sometimes you get so lonely
  Sometimes you get nowhere
  I've lived all over the world
  I've left every place

CHORUS
  Please be mine
  Share my life
  Stay with me
  Be my wife

VERSE

CHORUS

Sometimes you get so lonely

(Recorded during the Low sessions at The Chateau, Paris, France and Hansa Tonstudio, Berlin, Germany in 1976-1977).





Beat Of Your Drum

 

Photograph king, watches you go
Now fashions may change, heaven knows, but you still leave a stain on me

Lowly to go, colours may fade
The seasons may change, weather blows, but you still leave a mark on me

Wrong - negative fades - never the twain, reckless and tame

I like the beat of your drum
I like the look in your eyes
I like to look through your things
I'd like to beat on your drum

I like the smell of your flesh
I like the dirt that you dish
I like the clothes that you wear
I'd like to beat on your drum
I'd beat it, I'd beat it, can't feel it, I feel it

Disco brat - follow the pack
Watching you peel, Heaven knows, prison can't hold all this greedy intention

Lowly need to go - I picture you now
Music may change hi-di-ho keen to follow your nose

Wrong - love out of tune
Sweet is the night, bright light destroys me

I like the beat of your drum
I like to look in your eyes
I like to look through your things
I'd like to beat on your drum

I like the smell of your flesh
I like the dirt that you dish
I like the clothes that you wear
I'd like to beat on your drum
I'd beat it, I'd beat it, can't feel it, I feel it

I'd like to beat on your drum, oh yeah
I'd like to beat on your drum
I'd like your face in the crowd
I'd like to beat on your drum
I'd beat it, I'd beat it, can't feel it, I feel it

Can't beat it, can't beat it, I'd beat it, oh yeah

I'd like to beat on your drum
I'd like to beat on your drum
I'd like to yell it all out
I'd like to beat on your drum
Can't beat it, can't beat it, I feel it, I feel it

I'd like to beat on your drum
I'd like to beat on your drum
I like your face in the crowd
I'd like to beat on your drum
Beat it, can't beat it

Can't beat it, I beat it
Beat it out loud, beat it out in the crowd
Beat it, beat it, beat it, beat it

I'd like to beat on your drum
I'd like to beat on your drum
I'd like to blow on your horn
I'd like to beat on your drum

Ah hit it




Beauty And The Beast

 

Oooooooo...

Weaving down a byroad, singing the song
That's my kind of high rolling gone wrong
My-my
Smile at least
You can't say no to the Beauty and the Beast

Something in the night
Something in the day
Nothing is wrong but darling
Something's in the way
There's slaughter in the air
Protest on the wind
Someone else inside me
Someone could get skinned, how?
My-my
Someone fetch a Priest
You can't say no to the Beauty and the Beast
Darling

My-my
You can't say no to the Beauty and the Beast
(Weakling)
My-my
You can't say no to the Beauty and the Beast

I wanted to believe me
I wanted to be good
I wanted no distractions
Like every good boy should

My-my

Nothing will corrupt us
Nothing will compete
Thank God Heaven left us
Standing on our feet
My-my
Beauty and the Beast

My-my
Just Beauty and the Beast
You can't say no to the Beauty and the Beast
Darling

My-my
My
My-my
My

Because I'm Young

 

(Earlier version of Because You're Young)

Look in my eyes
Nobody home
I can be happy
Dead or alive
People I know, people I love
They could be happy if I were dead or alive

La la la la la la la la la la la laaaaa ahhh
I should be older
Oh oh
I should be older

CHORUS
  Because I'm young - don't mean it's alright
  Because I'm young - don't feel you're over
  'Cos it makes me laugh
  'Cos it takes, a million years
  A million dreams, a million scars

Look in my eyes
Nobody home
I could be happy
Dead or alive
People I know, people I love
They could be happy if I were dead or alive

La la la la la la la la la la la la la laaaaa ahhh
I should be older
Ahh Oh
I should be older

CHORUS
  Because I'm young - don't mean it's alright
  Because I'm young - don't feel you're over
  'Cos it makes me laugh
  'Cos it takes, a million years
  A million dreams, a million
  A million, a million, a million scars

(Repeat ad inf.)

(From demo sessions recorded in 1980 for the Scary Monsters (And Super Creeps) album. Original version of Because You're Young).





Because You're Young

 

Psychodelicate girl - come out to play
Little metal faced-boy - don't stay away
He's so war-torn and resigned she can't talk anymore
What are they trying to prove?
What would they like to find?

It's love back to front and no sides - like I say
These pieces are broken - like I say
These pieces are broken
Hope I'm wrong but I know

CHORUS
  Because you're young - you'll meet a stranger some night
  Because you're young - what could be nicer for you and it makes me sad
  So I'll dance my life away
  A million dreams, a million scars

He punishes hard - was loving her such a crime?
She took back everything she said
Left him nearly out of his mind
They're people I know - people I love
They seem so unhappy - dead or alive

It's love back to front and no sides - like I say
These pieces are broken - like I say
These pieces are broken
Hope I'm wrong but I know

CHORUS
  Because you're young - you'll meet a stranger some night
  Because you're young - what could be nicer for you and it'll make me sad
  So I'll dance my life away
  A million dreams, a million scars

A million
A million scars
A million
A million dreams
A million (repeat ad inf.)

Betty Wrong

(David Bowie/Reeves Gabrels)

Till the sun blisters and sprays
And every lamb ceases to graze
When the kiss of the comb
Tears my face from the bone

CHORUS
  I'll be your light
  When the shadows fall down the walls
  Then life will be done
  And it just won't matter at all

I was caught from a hand
Nurtured on grime, goodwill and screams
Now your breath fills my step
Now there is you till life is gone

CHORUS

I'll roll your ball
Till the stars can't make me cry
Then life will be done
And it just won't matter at all
Not at all

When the kiss of the comb
Tears my face




Bewitched, Bothered And Bewildered

(Richard Rodgers)







Big Boss Man

(Luther Dixon/Al Smith)

Big boss man, can't you hear me when I call?
Big boss man, can't you hear me when I call?
You ain't so big, you just tall, that's just about all.

You got me working boss man, a workin' around the clock,
I want a little drink of whiskey, you sure won't let me stop.
Big boss man, can't you hear me when I call?
You ain't so big, you just tall, that's just about all.
I'm gonna get me a boss man, one gonna treat me right,
I work hard in the daytime, sure get drunk at night.
You ain't so big, you just tall, that's just about all.

(Performed live by Davy Jones and The Manish Boys).





Big Brother

 

Don't talk of dust and roses
Or should we powder our noses?
Don't live for last year's capers
Give me steel, give me steel, give me pulsars unreal

He'll build a glass asylum
With just a hint of mayhem
He'll build a better whirlpool
We'll be living from sin, then we can really begin

Please savior, saviour, show us
Hear me, I'm graphically yours

CHORUS
  Someone to claim us, someone to follow
  Someone to shame us, some brave Apollo
  Someone to fool us, someone like you

We want you Big Brother, Big Brother

I know you think you're awful square
But you made everyone and you've been everywhere
Lord, I'd take an overdose if you knew what's going down

CHORUS (3 times)

We want you Big Brother

(Recorded during the Diamond Dogs sessions at the Olympic Studios, Barnes, London SW13 in 1974).

Pack a pack horse up and rest up here on
Black Country Rock
You never know you might find it here on
Black Country Rock

Pack a pack horse up and rest up here on

You can leave my friend and me with fond adieu

(Recorded during the Ziggy Stardust sessions 1972).





Black Tie White Noise

 

Getting my facts from a Benetton ad
I'm lookin' thru' African eyes
Lit by the glare of an L.A. fire
I've got a face, not just my race, bang bang I've got you babe

Sun comes up and the man goes down
And the woman comes again
Just an hour or so to be safe from fear
Then we jump thru' hoops, we're divisible now, just disappear

We reach out over race and hold each other's hands
Then die in the flames singing "we shall overcome"
Whoa! What's going on?
There'll be some blood no doubt about it
But we'll come thru' don't doubt it
I look into your eyes and I know you won't kill me
You won't kill me
You won't kill me
But I look into your eyes
And I wonder sometimes

Oh Lord, just let him see me
Lord, Lord just let him hear me
Let him call me brother
Let him put his arms around me
Let him put his hands together

Reach over race and hold each other's hands
Walk thru' the night thinking we are the world
Woa! What's going on?
There'll be some blood no doubt about it
But we'll come thru' don't doubt it

I look into your eyes and I know you won't kill me
You won't kill me
You won't kill me
But I wonder why
Yes, and I wonder why sometimes

They'll show us how to break the rules
But never how to make the rules
Reduce us down to witless punks
Fascist cries both black and white, who's got the blood, who's got the gun

Putting on the black tie, crankin' out the white noise

(Just a fool!)




Blackout

 

Oh you, you walk on past
Your lips cut a smile on your face
Your scalding face
To the cage, to the cage
She was a beauty in a cage

Too, too high a price
To drink rotting wine from your hands
Your fearful hands
Get me to a doctor's I've been told
Someone's back in town the chips are down
I just cut and blackout
I'm under Japanese influence
And my honour's at stake

The weather's grim, ice on the cages
Me, I'm Robin Hood and I puff on my cigarette
Panthers are steaming, stalking, screaming

If you don't stay tonight
I will take that plane tonight
I've nothing to lose, nothing to gain
I'll kiss you in the rain
Kiss you in the rain
Kiss you in the rain
In the rain
Get me to the doctor

Get me off the streets (get some protection)
Get me on my feet (get some direction)
Hot air gets me into a blackout
Oh, get me off the streets
Get some protection
Oh get me on my feet (wo-ooh!)

While the streets block off
Getting some skin exposure to the blackout (get some protection)
Get me on my feet (get some direction, wo-ooh!)
Oh get me on my feet
Get me off the streets (get some protection)
In a *? second *  ?  *

(Recorded during the "Heroes" sessions at Hansa Tonstudio, Berlin, Germany in 1977).

Bleed Like A Craze, Dad

 

Shine shine shine (x6)

Bleed like a craze, Dad
These are the Krays

Easy come
Come, gather that
Gather valium of your dead man
Walks out the drunk from the jazz

Astral, Kestrel
Fed into the featherfall
Fed him on a pencil carving
You will never get

Shine shine shine
Bleed like a craze, Dad
These are the Krays
Shine shine shine
Bleed like a craze, Dad
These are the Krays

Seek for a leather journey
Never stopped to think about
Hollywood King Kong
Domino on the side

Street light, looking right
Looking to the parlous parlours
Party on the dead
Put a net through his headache

Shine shine shine (x3)

Blee-eed, bleed like a craze, Dad
These are the Krays

Living on a movie
All the Shirley/Charlie films on film
Come together, party
Footnote on the footstone

Shine shine shine
Bleeds like a craze, Dad
These are the Krays

Shine shine shine
Shine shine shine

CHORUS (x6)
  Bleed like a craze, Dad
  These are the Krays

Blue Jean

 

Blue Jean - I just met a girl named Blue Jean
Blue Jean - she got a camouflaged face and no money
Remember they always let you down when you need 'em
Oh, Blue Jean - is heaven any sweeter than Blue Jean
She's got a police bike
She's got turned up nose

Sometimes I feel like
  (Oh, the whole human race)
Jazzin' for Blue Jean
  (Oh, and when my Blue Jean's blue)
Blue Jean can send me
  (Oh, somebody send me)
Somebody send me
  (Oh, somebody send me)

One day I'm gonna write a poem in a letter
One day I'm gonna get that faculty together
Remember like everybody has to wait in line
Blue Jean - look out world you know I've got mine
She got Latin roots
She got everything

Sometimes I feel like
  (Oh, the whole human race)
Jazzin' for Blue Jean
  (Oh, and when my Blue Jean's blue)
Blue Jean can take me
  (Oh, somebody send me)
Somebody send me
  (Oh, somebody send me)

Sometimes I feel like

Blues In The Night

(Performed live by The Hooker Brothers).





Bombers

 

(CHORUS)
  All clear wailed the sirens
  Sunshine on the wasteland
  Old man sitting in the white sand
  Think we're in for a big surprise
  Right between the eyes

Seemed a good idea
To drop a bomb on the wasteland here
Only one man could be seen
And he was old and so serene
Captain sat in his deck chair
And the red light flashed beware
Pilot felt quite big-time
As the bombs sailed through the air
Well, they danced and sang
When the bang went bang
But the light popped out
When the smoke began to clear
It was positively queer

(CHORUS)

"Die" said the General
"Cobblers" said the man
So the Pentagon sent a cable
And the Queen a telegram
A-bombs, H-bombs, even very small ones
Ripped apart that sand
'Til the stench was just revolting
And the sky a greenish tan
Then a soldier said "Sir, there's a crack in the world"
The figures went "squash"
And the bits flew far and wide
How the universe sighed!

(CHORUS twice)

When the smoke had blown away
There was nothing left to view
Except a man dear Lord who looked like you
Floating high up in the sky

Boys Keep Swinging

(Lyrics: David Bowie. Music: David Bowie/Brian Eno)

1-2-3-4
Heaven loves ya
The clouds part for ya
Nothing stands in your way
When you're a boy

Clothes always fit ya
Life is a pop of the cherry
When you're a boy

When you're a boy
You can wear a uniform
When you're a boy
Other boys check you out
You get a girl
These are your favourite things
When you're a boy

Boys
Boys
Boys keep swinging
Boys always work it out

Uncage the colours
Unfurl the flag
Luck just kissed you hello!
When you're a boy

They'll never clone ya
You're always first on the line
When you're a boy

When you're a boy
You can buy a home of your own
When you're a boy
Learn to drive and everything
You'll get your share
When you're a boy

Boys
Boys
Boys keep swinging
Boys always work it out

Breaking Glass

(David Bowie/Dennis James Davis/George W. Murray)

Baby, I've been, breaking glass in your room again
Listen

Don't look at the carpet, I drew something awful on it
See

You're such a wonderful person
But you got problems
Oh-oh-oh-oh
I'll never touch you

Buddha Of Suburbia

 

Living in lies by the railway line
Pushing the hair from my eyes
Elvis is English and climbs the hills
Can't tell the bullshit from the lies
Screaming along in South London
Vicious but ready to learn
Sometimes I fear that the whole world is queer
Sometimes but always in vain

CHORUS
  So I'll wait until we're sane
  Wait until we're blessed and all the same
  Full of blood, loving life and all it's got to give
  Englishman going insane
  Down on my knees in suburbia
  Down on myself in every way

With great expectations I change all my clothes
Mustn't grumble at silver and gold
Screaming above Central London
Never bored, so I'll never get old

CHORUS

Day after
Day after
Day
Day after
Zane, Zane, Zane
Ouvre le chien
Day after
Day
Day after
Zane, Zane, Zane
Ouvre le chien

Bus Stop

(David Bowie/Reeves Gabrels)

There's a cry that is heard in the city
From Vivian at Pentecost Lane
A shriekin' and dancing till 4 a.m.
Another night of muscles and pain
I love you despite your convictions
Though God never laughs at my jokes

CHORUS
  I'm a young man at odds with the Bible
  But I don't pretend faith never works
  When we're down on our knees
  Prayin' at the bus stop

Now Jesus he came in a vision
And offered you redemption from sin
I'm not sayin' that I don't believe you
But are you sure that it really was him?
I've been told that it could've been blue cheese
Or the meal that we ate down the road
Hallelujah

CHORUS




Buzz The Fuzz

(Paul Conrad Rose)

Once there was a fellow
And his name was Buzz
He was just a rookie cop
Just a baby fuzz

He patrolled the Sunset Strip
In the land of the free
And the home of the hip

He protected you and me from evil women like
Poor Alice D

Alice was the girl
That all good hippies dread
And they called her sweet Alice D'head

Alice it was plain to see was
Full of pot and STP
She'd attract a great big crowd
Because her inner peace was much too loud

Good Buzz did the thing
That all the good fuzz must
Stuck his gun in Alice's back
And said "This is a bust"

Shone the flashlight in her eyes
She began to hypnotise
Buzz said "What a wild sensation"
Guess this must be hallu hallucina cina cina cination  hmmm

Love is so sensational
When you fall in love with eyes dilational  la la
Now they're taking pills and shots
And Buzz is not afraid of Watts

Buzz and Alice D have shown
The way of where the Fuzz might be some day

Buzz is still a cop of course
He's the pusher on the force
He's protecting you and me
From evil women
Like poor Alice D




C'est La Vie

 

Through my window I can see
If the world is there for me
Will my shadow on the floor let me be?
And tomorrow calls my name
But I don't want to go
Through the burning flames of time

C'est la vie
C'est la vie

With my friends I play the tune
Warm and tired within my room
And the crackle of the fire whispered low
Now tomorrow takes my hand
But I don't want to go
Through the burning flames of time

C'est la vie
C'est la vie

How can I sail my good times
Over the waves of sorrow?
Show me tomorrow
Show me tomorrow
So that I will know

La la la la la la la
La la la la la la la
La la la la la la la
La la la

Now tomorrow takes my hand
But I don't want to go
Through the burning flames of time

C'est la vie
C'est la vie

Through the burning flames of time
C'est la vie
C'est la vie




Cactus

(Black Francis)

Sitting here wishing on a cement floor
Just wishing that I had just something you wore

I put it on when I go lonely
Will you take off your dress and send it to me?

I miss your kissin' and I miss your head
And a letter in your writing doesn't mean you're not dead

Just run outside in the desert heat
Make your dress all wet and send it to me

I miss your soup and I miss your bread
And a letter in your writing doesn't mean you're not dead

So spill your breakfast and drip your wine
Just wear that dress when you di yi yi yi yine

D -A -V -I -D

Sitting here wishing on a cement floor
Just wishing that I had just something you wore
So bloody your hands on a cactus tree
Wipe it on your dress and send it to me

Sitting here wishing on a cement floor
Just wishing that I had just something you wore

Can You Hear Me

 

Once we were lovers, can they understand?
Closer than others I was your, I was your man
Don't talk of heartaches, ooh, I remember them all
And I'm taking you out one day, to see if I'm
Faking it all

CHORUS
  Can you hear me?
  Can you feel me inside?
  Show your love, love

Sixty new cities, an' what do I, what do I
What do I find?
I want love so badly, I want you most of all
You know, it's harder to take it from anyone
It's harder to fall
Can you hear me call ya?

CHORUS

Well, can you hear me? (yeah)
Can you feel me inside? (I do)
Show your love, show your sweet, sweet love
Show me your love

(Cover version of the Marvin Gaye hit performed live by Davie Jones and The King Bees).





Can't Help Thinking About Me

 

Question-time that says I brought dishonour
My head's bowed in shame
It seems that I've blackened the family name
Mother says that she can't stand the neighbours' talking
I've gotta pack my bags, leave this home, start walking, yeah
I'm guilty
I wish that I was sorry this time
I wish that I could pay for my crime

I can't help thinking about me

Remember when we used to go to church on Sunday's
I lay awake at night, terrified of school on Monday's
Oh, but it's too late now
I wish I was a child again
I wish I felt secure again

I can't help thinking about me

As I pass a recreation ground
I remember my friends, always been found and I can't

I can't help thinking about me

Now I leave them all in the Never-Never Land
The station seems so cold, the ticket's in my hand
My girl calls my name "Hi Dave
Drop in, see around, come back
If you're this way again"
Oh, I'm on my own
I've got a long way to go
I hope I make it on my own

I can't help thinking about me




Can't Nobody Love

Candidate

 

I'll make you a deal, like any other candidate
We'll pretend we're walking home 'cos your future's at stake
My set is amazing, it even smells like a street
There's a bar at the end where I can meet you and your friend
Someone scrawled on the wall 'I smell the blood of Les Tricoteuses'
Wrote up scandals in other bars

I'm having so much fun with the poisonous people
Spreading rumours and lies and stories they've made up
Some make you sing and some make you scream
One makes you wish that you'd never been seen
But there's a shop on the corner that's selling papier mache
Making bullet-proof faces, Charlie Manson, Cassius Clay
If you want it, boys, get it here, thing

So you scream out of line
"I want you! I need you! Anyone out there? Anytime?"
Tres butch little number whines "Hey girlie, I want you
When it's good, it's really good, and when it's bad I go to pieces"
If you want it, boys, get it here, thing

On the street where you live I could not hold up my head
For I put all I had in another bed
On another floor, in the back of a car
In a cellar like a church with the door ajar
Well, I guess we must be looking for a different kind
But we can't stop trying 'til we break up our minds
'Til the sun drips blood on the seedy young knight
Who press you on the ground while shaking in fright
I guess we could cruise down one more time
With you by my side, it should be fine
We'll buy some drugs and watch a band
Then jump in a river holding hands

(Recorded during the Diamond Dogs sessions at the Olympic Studios, Barnes, London SW13 in 1974).





Candidate (working lyrics)

 

It's a street - like any other street - with a guillotine on one side - home on the other side

This corridor's amazing they've even built it like this street
This corridor's amazing it even smells like a street
There's a bar at the end where the condemned meet

Someone's scrawled on the wall "I smell the blood of Les Tricoteuses"
Who wrote up the hangings executions scandals up in other bars

I'm having so much fun with the Poisonous People
Spreading rumours and lies and stories they've made up

Some make you sing and some make you scream
One makes you wish that you'd never been seen
But there's a shop boy on the corner that's who's selling papier-mache
Making bullet proof faces Charlie Manson, Cassius Clay

If you want it boys get it here, thing
So you scream out of line I want you - I need you
Anyone out there - anytime any candidates
Then butch little number whines "Hey dirty I want you"
When it's good really good when it's bad I go to pieces
If you want it boys get it here thing

On the street where you live I could not hold up my head
For I've put all I had in another bed
On another floor in the back of a car
In a cellar like a church like with door ajar

I guess we must be looking for a different kind
But we can't stop tryin' till we break up our minds
Till the sun drips blood on the seedy young knight
Who dress you on the ground while shaking in fright

I guess we could cruise down one more time
With you by my side, it should be fine
Buy some drugs and watch a band
Then jump in a river holding hands

(Written during the Diamond Dogs sessions at the Olympic Studios, Barnes, London SW13 in 1974).





Candidate (demo version)

 

Inside every teenage girl there's a fountain
Inside every young pair of pants there's a mountain
Inside every mother's eyes is Tommy Tinkrem's bed
Inside every candidate waits a grateful dead

I make it a thing, when I'm on my own to relieve myself
I make it a thing, when I gazelle on stage to believe in myself
I make it a thing, to glance in window panes and look pleased with myself
Yeah, and pretend I'm walking home

I took it so bad, I sat in the correction room
Took me a fag, and a kick in the moon
Well I, ain't gonna suck no radar wing
'Cos inside this tin is tin
Would you like techno-plate 'cos I'm your candidate, oh yeah

It's a matter of life
And the way you walk, you've got a Brylcream queen
It's a matter of tact
In the things you talk, that keeps his passport clean
A matter of fact
That a cock ain't a cock on a twelve inch screen
So I'll pretend I'm walking home

You don't have to scream a lot to keep an ageing tune
You don't have to scream a lot to predict monsoons
You don't have to paint my contact black
Now I've hustled a pair of jeans
Do I have to give your money back when I'm the Fuhrerling?

I'll make you a deal
I'll say I came from Earth and my tongue is taped
I'll make you a deal
You can get your kicks on the candidate
I'll make you a deal
For your future's sake, I'm the candidate
Let's pretend we're walking home

Uh-huh, uhhh
I'm the candidate
Make way for the candidate
Vote now for the candidate

(Demo version recorded in 1973).





Cat People (Putting Out Fire)

(Lyrics: David Bowie. Music: David Bowie/Giorgio Moroder)

See these eyes so green
I can stare for a thousand years
Colder than the Moon
Well it's been so long

And I've been putting out fire with gasoline

See these eyes so red
Red like jungle burning bright
Those who feel me near
Pull the blinds and change their minds
It's been so long

Still this pulsing night
A plague I call a heartbeat
Just be still with me
Well you wouldn't believe what I've been through
You've been so long
Well it's been so long
I've been putting out fire with gasoline
Putting out fire
With gasoline

See these tears so blue
An ageless heart that can never mend
Tears can never dry
A judgement made can never bend

See these eyes so green
I can stare for a thousand years
Just be still with me
You wouldn't believe what I've been through

Well you've been so long
Well it's been so long
And I've been putting out fire with gasoline
Putting out the fire with gasoline

Putting out fire
Well I've been putting out fire

Well, it's been so long, so long  (so long)
Yes, it's been so long  (so long, so long)
I've been putting out fire
  (Been so long, so long)
I've been putting out fire
  (Been so long, so long)
Putting out fire
  (Been so long, so long)
I've been putting out fire
  (Been so long, so long)
I've been putting out fire
  (Been so long, so long)
Putting out fire
  (Been so long, so long)
Been so long
  (Been so long, so long)
Been so long
  (Been so long, so long)
Putting out fire
  (Been so long, so long)
I've been putting out fire





Changes

 

Low down
Ooo

Still don't know what I was waiting for
And my time was running wild
A million dead-end streets and
Every time I thought I'd got it made
It seemed the taste was not so sweet
So I turned myself to face me
But I've never caught a glimpse
Of how the others must see the faker
I'm much too fast to take that test

Ch-ch-ch-ch-Changes
  (Turn and face the strange)
Ch-ch-Changes
Don't wanna be a richer man
Ch-ch-ch-ch-Changes
  (Turn and face the strange)
Ch-ch-Changes
Just gonna have to be a different man
Time may change me
But I can't trace time

Ooo yeah
I watch the ripples change their size
But never leave the stream
Of warm impermanence and
So the days float through my eyes
But still the days seem the same
And these children that you spit on
As they try to change their worlds
Are immune to your consultations
They're quite aware of what they're going through

Ch-ch-ch-ch-Changes
  (Turn and face the strange)
Ch-ch-Changes
Don't tell them to grow up and out of it
Ch-ch-ch-ch-Changes
  (Turn and face the strange)
Ch-ch-Changes
Where's your shame
You've left us up to our necks in it
Time may change me
But you can't trace time

Strange fascination, fascinating me
Ah changes are taking the pace I'm going through

Ch-ch-ch-ch-Changes
  (Turn and face the strange)
Ch-ch-Changes
Oh, look out you rock 'n rollers
Ch-ch-ch-ch-Changes
  (Turn and face the strange)
Ch-ch-Changes
Pretty soon now you're gonna get older
Time may change me
But I can't trace time
I said that time may change me
But I can't trace time




Chant Of The Ever-Circling Skeletal Family

 

CHANT (6 times)
  Brother
  Ooh-ooh
  Shake it up, shake it up
  Move it up, move it up

Bro bro bro bro bro bro bro bro bro (repeat ad inf.)

(Recorded during the Diamond Dogs sessions at the Olympic Studios, Barnes, London SW13 in 1974).





Chilly Down

 

When the sun goes down (when the sun goes down)
And the bats are back to bed (and the bats are back)
The brothers come 'round (the brothers come 'round)
I get out of my dirty bed (my dirty bed)
I shake my pretty little head (I shake my pretty little head)
Tap my pretty little feet (tap my pretty little feet)
Feeling brighter than sunlight (oh)
Louder than thunder (oh)
Bouncing like a yo-yo, wooh (oh)

Don't got no problems (no problems)
Ain't got no suitcase (no suitcase)
Ain't got no clothes to worry about (no clothes to worry about)
Ain't got no real estate or jewelry or gold mines to hang me up.

I just throw in my hand (throw in my hand)
With the chilliest bunch in the land (in the land)
They don't look much (oh)
They sure chilly chilly (oh)
They positively glow glow, huh (oh)

Chilly down with the fire gang
Think small with the fire gang (It's the only way)
Bad hep with the fire gang (a smile a day keeps the doctor away)
When your thing gets wild
Chilly down

Chilly down with the fire gang (Hey, I'm a wild child)
Act tall with the fire gang (whoo, walk tall)
Good times, bad food (yeah)
When your thing gets wild
Chilly down, chilly down

Drive you crazy, really lazy, eye rollin', funky strollin', ball playin'
Hip swayin', trouble makin', booty shakin', tripping, passing, jumping
Bouncing, drivin', stylin', creeping, pouncing, shoutin', screamin'
Double dealin', rockin', rollin', and a reelin'
With the mackin' sex appealin'.
Can you dig our groovy feelin'?

So when things get too tough (get too tough)
And your chin is dragging on the ground (dragging on the ground)
And even down looks up (down looks up)
Bad luck heh heh
We can show you a good time (show you a good time)
And we don't charge nothin' (nothin' at all)
Just strut your nasty stuff
Wiggle in the middle yeh
Get the town talkin', fire gang

Chilly down with the fire gang (think small)
Think small with the fire gang
Bad hep with the fire gang (hey, listen up)
When your thing gets wild
Chilly down

Chilly down with the fire gang (hey, shake your pretty little head)
Think small with the fire gang (tap your pretty little feet)
Good times, bad food (come on, come on)
When your thing gets wild
Chilly down

Chilly down with the fire gang (wooh)
Think small with the fire gang
Bad hep with the fire gang




China Girl

(Iggy Pop/David Bowie)

Oh oh oh ohhhh, little China Girl
Oh oh oh ohhhh, little China Girl

I could escape this feeling, with my China Girl
I feel a wreck without my, little China Girl
I hear her heart beating, loud as thunder
Saw they stars crashing

I'm a mess without, my little China Girl
Wake up in the morning where's my, little China Girl
I hear her heart's beating, loud as thunder
I saw the stars crashing down

I feel a-tragic like I'm Marlon Brando
When I look at my China Girl
And I could pretend that nothing really meant too much
When I look at my China Girl

I stumble into town, just like a sacred cow
Visions of swastikas in my head
Plans for everyone
It's in the whites of my eyes

My little China Girl
You shouldn't mess with me
I'll ruin everything you are
Y'know, I'll give you television
I'll give you eyes of blue
I'll give you a man who wants to rule the world

And when I get excited
My little China Girl says
"Oh baby just you shut your mouth"
She says... "sh-sh-shhh"
She says... "sh-sh-shhh"
She says
She says

And when I get excited
My little China Girl says
"Oh baby just you shut your mouth"

And when I get excited
My little China Girl says
"Oh baby just you shut your mouth"

She says... "sh-sh-shhh"
She says

Oh oh oh ohhhh, little China Girl
Oh oh oh ohhhh, little China Girl
Oh oh oh ohhhh, little China Girl
Oh oh oh ohhhh, little China Girl




Ching-A-Ling

 

While walking on Red Rooster's lawn
A char-faced man I'd spy
He blew into his handkerchief
And stuttered as he sighed
I wish I'd play the doo-dah horn
The doo-dah horn is fine
I'd sell my house and ferny coach
To make this daydream mine

Doo-dah doo, doo-dah (etc)

Whilst flying through an azure cloud
A crystal girl I'd spy
She kissed the blue bird's honey tongue
And stuttered as she sighed
I wish to sing the Ching-A-Ling song
Ching-A-Ling song is fine
I'd give my jewels and caviar
To make this daydream mine

(Ching-A-Ling, Ching-A-Ling, Ching-A-Ling) (etc)

While stepping through a heaven's eye
Two lover souls we spied
They wished the cloud boys sang to me
A cheerful happy cry
We love to play our love-strong hearts
No better do we know
No gifts of money do we give
For love is all we own)

Na na na na na na, na na na na na na na na
(Ching-A-Ling, Ching-A-Ling, Ching-A-Ling) (etc)




Columbine

 

Columbine, my prayer design
I see you see me standing on my own
Is it you that I'm walking through?
Should I retrace my point of view?
I'm left in clouded dreams of finding who?
Not Columbine!

Just in case you're my disguise
I found yourself to my surprise
I'm on the ground
And it's Harlequin who picks me up
And catches you
Who banishes me
For finding who you are

(Written and recorded for 'The Looking Glass Murders' production for Scottish TV. Recorded at The Gateway Theatre, Edinburgh, Scotland on 1st February 1970).





Come And Buy My Toys

 

Smiling girls and rosy boys
Come and buy my little toys
Monkeys made of gingerbread
And sugar horses painted red

Rich mens' children running past
Their fathers dressed in hose
Golden hair and mud of many acres on their shoes
Gazing eyes and running wild
Past the stocks and over stiles
Kiss the wind oh merry child
But come and buy my toys

You've watched your father plough the fields with a ram's horn
Sowed it wide with peppercorn and furrowed with a bramble thorn
Reaped it with a sharpened scythe, threshed it with a quill
The miller told your father that he'd work it with the greatest will
Now your watching's over you must play with girls and boys
Leave the parsley on the stalls
Come and buy my toys

You shall own a Cambric shirt
You shall work your father's land
But now you shall play in the market square
Till you'll be a man

Smiling girls and rosy boys
Come and buy my little toys
Monkeys made of gingerbread
And sugar horses painted red




Come See About Me

(Holland/Dozier/Holland)

I've been cryin' (boo-hoo)
'Cause I'm lonely (for you)
Smiles have all turned (to tears)
But tears won't wash away the fear

That you're never ever gonna return (hey, hey, hey, hey, hey)
To ease the fire that within me burns (hey, hey, hey, hey, hey)
It keeps me cryin', baby, for you
Keep me sighin', baby, for you

So won't you hurry
Come on, boy, see about me (come see about me)
See about your baby (come see about me)

I've given up my friends just (for you)
My friends have gone and you have too
No more peace will I find (mmm, mmm)
Until you come back and be mine (mmm, mmm)

No matter what you do or say (hey, hey, hey, hey, hey)
I'm gonna love you anyway (hey, hey, hey, hey, hey)
Keep on cryin', baby, for you
I'm gonna keep me sighin', baby, for you

So come on hurry
Come on and see about me (come see about me)
See about your baby (come see about me)

Sometimes up (up, mmm, mmm)
Sometimes down (down, mmm, mmm)
My life is uncertain (mmm, mmm)
With you not around (mmm, mmm)

From my arms you may be out of reach (hey, hey, hey, hey, hey)
But my heart says you're here to keep (hey, hey, hey, hey, hey)
Keeps me cryin', baby, for you
Keep on, keep on cryin', baby, for you

So won't you hurry
Come on, boy, see about me (come see about me)
See about your baby (come see about me)
You know I'm so lonely (come see about me)
I love you only (come see about me)
See about your baby (come see about me)
Hurry, hurry (come see about me)

(Performed live by David Bowie and The Buzz).

(See Even A Fool Learns To Love)





Conversation Piece - (demo)

 

I took this walk to ease my mind
Find out what's gnawing at me
Wouldn't think to look at me
That I spent a lot of time on education
All seems so long ago
I'm a thinker, not a talker
There's no-one to talk to anyway

I can't see the road
For the rain in my eyes
Ahhhhh...h-h

I live above the grocer's store
Owned by an Austrian
Often calls me down to eat
And he jokes about his broken English
Tries to be a friend to me
But for all my years of reading conversation
I stand without a word to say

I can't see the bridge
For the rain in my eyes
Ahhhhh...h-h

And the world is full of life
Full of folk who don't know me
And they walk in two's or three's or more
While the light that shines above the grocer's store
Investigates my face so rudely
And my essays lying scattered on the floor
Fulfill their need just by being there
And my hands shake, my head hurts
My voice sticks inside my throat
I'm invisible and dumb
And no-one will recall me

And I can't see the water
For the tears in my ey-y-yes

(Appears on a demo tape recorded by David Bowie and John 'Hutch' Hutchinson in April 1969).

Cosmic Dancer

(Marc Bolan) (Morrissey's version)

I was dancing when I was twelve
I was dancing when I was twelve
I was dancing when I was... oh
I was dancing when I was... oh
I danced myself out of the womb
I danced myself out of the womb
Is it strange to dance so soon?
Is it strange to dance so soon?

Is it wrong to understand
The fear that dwells inside a man?
What's it like to be a loon?
I liken it to a balloon
Oh... Oh...

I danced myself into the tomb
I danced myself into the tomb
Is it strange to dance so soon?
Is it strange to dance so soon?

Is it wrong to understand
The fear that dwells inside a man?
What's it like to be a loon?
I liken it to a balloon
Oh... Oh... Whoo... Whoo... Whoo...

(Performed live duet with Morrissey at the Inglewood Forum, Los Angeles, USA on 26th May 1991 on the Morrissey World Tour).





Crack City

 

Oh come all you children
Don't grab that scabby hand
It belongs to Mr. Sniff and Tell
It belongs to the candyman

Don't whore your little body
The worms of paradise
Like Everest it's fatal
Its peaks are cold as ice

They're riding on the subway
They're riding on the street
They'll ride you down to the gutter
They'll ride you off your feet

CHORUS
  Gonna hit Crack City
  Hit Crack City

Yeah an' piss on the icon monster
Whose guitars bequeath you pain
They'll face you down to their level
With their addictions and their fast lanes

Corrupt with shaky visions
And crack and coke and alcohol
They're just a bunch of assholes
With buttholes for their brains

You can't keep on riding
The pain you know so well
They'll ride you down to the gutter
Then they'll ride you down to hell

CHORUS

And you the master dealer
May death be on your brow
May razors slash your mainline
I'm calling you out right now

May all your vilest nightmares
Consume your shrunken head
May the ho-ho-hounds of paranoia
Dance upon your stinking bed

Don't look at me you fuckhead
This nation's turning blue
Its stink it fouls the highways
Its filth it sticks like glue

CHORUS

They'll bury you in velvet
And place you underground
The hatred of yourself
And the sufferings that conspire
To take your little body and throw it to the fools
Only your mind can take you out of this
Only your mind or death

I'm riding on the subway
The subway down to hell
I've finished with this journey
Though I seem to know it well

CHORUS (x3)




Cracked Actor

 

I've come on a few years from my Hollywood Highs
The best of the last, the cleanest star they ever had
I'm stiff on my legend, the films that I made
Forget that I'm fifty 'cos you just got paid

CHORUS
  Crack baby crack, show me you're real
  Smack baby smack, is that all that you feel?
  Suck baby suck, give me your head
  Before you start professing that you're knocking me dead

(Oh stay, please stay, please stay)

You caught yourself a trick down on Sunset and Vine
But since he pinned you baby you're a porcupine
You sold me illusions for a sack full of cheques
You've made a bad connection 'cos I just want your sex

CHORUS

(Oh yea, oh stay, all day, oo yeah, oo yeah, don't you dare, oh yeah yeah yeah yeah)
(Ooo)
(Ooo, oh yeah)




Criminal World

(Peter Godwin/Duncan Browne/Sean Lyons)

You never told me of your other faces
You were the widow of a wild cat
And now I know about your special kisses
And I know you know where that's at
I guess I recognise your destination
I think I see beneath your make-up
What you want is sort of separation
This is no ordinary
This is no ordinary
    (Oh, oh, oh)

What a criminal world
The boys are like baby-faced girls
What a criminal girl
She'll show you where to shoot your gun
What a typical mother's son
The only thing that she enjoys
Is a criminal world
Where the girls are like baby-faced boys (boys, boys, boys)

You've got a very heavy reputation
But no-one knows about your low-life
I know a way to find a situation
And hold a candle to your high-life disguise
You caught me kneeling at your sister's door
That was no ordinary stick-up
I'm well aware just what you're looking for
I am no ordinary
I am no ordinary
    (Oh, oh, oh)

What a criminal world
The boys are like baby-faced girls
What a criminal girl
She'll show you where to shoot your gun
What a typical mother's son
The only thing that she enjoys
Is a criminal world
Where the girls are like baby-faced boys (boys, boys, boys)
Baby-faced (boys, boys, boys)
Baby-faced
What a criminal world
What a criminal
A criminal

What a criminal world
What a criminal

Cyclops

 

 


(Believed originally intended for David's proposed 1973 stage version of 'Nineteen Eighty-Four' which was aborted after George Orwell's widow Sonia Blair refused permission).

(Cyclops appears on a reel-to-reel tape dated 5.6.76. Recorded at Gooseberry Sound Studos, 19 Gerrard Street, London W1. Producer was John Shipcott. Also on the tape were three versions of Shadow Man (complete, vocal only and full vocal with half backing track) and The Invader. The tape was auctioned at Sotheby's in 1990).





Cygnet Committee

 

I bless you madly, sadly as I tie my shoes
I love you badly, just in time, at times, I guess
Because of you I need to rest
Because it's you that sets the test

So much has gone and little is new
And as the sparrow sings
Dawn chorus for
Someone else to hear
The Thinker sits alone growing older
And so bitter

    "I gave Them life
    I gave Them all
    They drained my very soul... dry
    I crushed my heart to ease Their pains
    No thought for me remains there
    Nothing can They spare
    What of me?
    Who praised Their efforts to be free?
    Words of strength and care and sympathy
    I opened doors that would have blocked Their way
    I braved Their cause to guide, for little pay
    I ravaged at my finance just for Those
    Those whose claims were steeped in peace, tranquility
    Those who said a new world, new ways ever free
    Those whose promises stretched in hope and grace for me"

I bless you madly, sadly as I tie my shoes
I love you badly, just in time, at times, I guess
Because of you I need to rest, oh yeah
Because it's you that sets the test

So much has gone and little is new
And as the sunrise stream
Flickers on me
My friends talk
Of glory, untold dream, where all is God and God is just a word

    "We had a friend, a talking man
    Who spoke of many powers he had
    Not of the best of men, but Ours
    We used him
    We let him use his powers
    We let him fill Our needs
    Now We are strong

    And the road is coming to its end
    Now the damned have no time to make amends
    No purse of token fortune stands in Our way
    The silent guns of love will blast the sky

    We broke the ruptured structure built of age
    Our weapons were the tongues of crying rage
    Where money stood
    We planted seeds of rebirth
    And stabbed the backs of fathers
    Sons of dirt

    Infiltrated business cesspools
    Hating through Our sleeves
    Yea, and We slit the Catholic throat
    Stoned the poor on slogans such as

    'Wish You Could Hear'
    'Love Is All We Need'
    'Kick Out The Jams'
    'Kick Out Your Mother'
    'Cut Up Your Friend'
    'Screw Up Your Brother or He'll Get You In the End'

    And We Know the Flag of Love is from Above
    And We Can Force You to Be Free
    And We Can Force You to Believe"

And I close my eyes and tighten up my brain
For I once read a book in which the lovers were slain
For they knew not the words of the Free States' refrain
It said:

    "I Believe in the Power of Good
     I Believe in the State of Love
     I Will Fight For the Right to be Right
     I Will Kill for the Good of the Fight for the Right to be Right"

And I open my eyes to look around
And I see a child laid slain on the ground
As a love machine lumbers through desolation rows
Ploughing down man, woman, listening to its command
But not hearing anymore -
Not hearing anymore
Just the shrieks from the old rich

And I Want to Believe
In the madness that calls 'Now'
And I want to Believe
That a light's shining through
Somehow

And I Want to Believe
And You Want to Believe
And We Want to Believe
And We Want to Live
Oh, We Want to Live

We Want to Live
We Want to Live
We Want to Live
We Want to Live
We Want to Live

I Want to Live
I Want to Live
I Want to Live
I Want to Live
I Want to Live
I Want to Live

Live
Live
Live

Dancing in the street

Don't you know they'll be dancing
Dancing in the street (repeat)

One wrong word and you're out of synch
Talking 'bout a hands on policy
(Big boys)
Death to the trees
(Dancing with the big boys)
They weren't bad, they weren't brave
Nothing is embarrassing
(Dancing with the big boys)
There are too many people, too much belief
(Dancing with the big boys)
Where there's trouble there's poetry
(Dancing with the big boys)
Your family is a football team
(Big boys)
This dot marks your location
(Dancing with the big boys)
Loneliness in a free society
(Dancing with the big boys)
(Big boys)
This could be embarrassing

Day-In Day-Out

 

Day-in day-out
Stay-in fade-out

Day-in oo oo
Day-out oo oo oo

She was born in a handbag
  Love left on a doorstep
What she lacks is a backup
  'Cause nothing seems to make a dent
Go and find her some money, honey
  Try to pay her rent
That's the kind of protection that everyone is shouting about

CHORUS
   Day-in day-out
   Stay-in fade-out

   Day-in oo oo
   Day-out oo oo oo

First thing she learns that she's a citizen
   Some things they turn out right
When you're on the USA
   Someone rings a bell and it's all over
She's going out of her way
   Stealing for that one good rush

Day-in day-out
Stay-in fade-out

She could use a little money
   She's hanging on his arm like a cheap suit
She's got no money, honey
   She's on the other side
Oh come on little baby
   Late night, big town, police, shake down

   Oo oo
   Oo oo
   Day-in day-out
   Stay-in fade-out
   Oo oo
   Oo oo
   Day-in day-out
   Stay-in fade-out

She's got a ticket to nowhere
   She's gonna take a train ride
Nobody knows her, or knows her name
   She's in the pocket of a homeboy
Oo she's gonna take her shotgun - pow!
   Spin the grail spin the drug
She's gonna make the world aware
   She's one angry gal

All of the day-in day-out
Stay-in fade-out

And there's angels everywhere
Some of them even shootin' her down
Shootin' all the video - drugs - bullets and promises
Angels in a ton of sound

   Day-in fade-out
   Oo oo
   Oo oo
   Day-in day-out
   Stay-in fade-out fade-out
All you gotta do is fade out




Dodo

 

Now we can talk in confidence
Did you guess that we've been done wrong?
Lies jump in queue to be first in line
Such a shameless design

Thinks he's well screened from the man at the top
It's a shame that his children disagree
They coolly decide to sell him down the line
Daddy's brainwashing time

He's a dodo, no no, didn't hear it from me
He's a dodo, no no, didn't hear it from me

She's quite enthralled with her childhood of yore
When a unit was a figure, not a she
When lovers chose each other, now the perks are due
Another memo to screw

She's a dodo, no no, didn't hear it from me
But she's a dodo, no no, didn't hear it from me

Can you wipe your nose my child
Without them slotting in your file a photograph?
Can you sleep alone at night?
Wake to find the scorching light of neighbour Jim
He's come to turn you in

Another dodo, no no, didn't hear it from me
Another dodo, no no, didn't hear it from me


Ah, another do do, no, didn't hear it
Do-do, do-do
do




Don't Be Afraid (alias Oh Darling)

 

Don't be afraid to reveal what you know
Don't be afraid to conceal what you show
Oh darling
Don't be afraid
Oh darling
I said, don't be afraid to say what you need
Don't be afraid
What you feel about me
Oh-oh-oh darling

Count me lucky like nobody else
Don't be afraid of me feeling yourself
Oh darling
Lucky forever
Oh darling
I said, don't be afraid to say what you need
Don't be afraid
What you feel about me
Oh-oh-oh darling

Don't be afraid to reveal what you know
Don't be afraid to conceal what you show
Oh darling
Don't be afraid
Oh darling
I said, don't be afraid to say what you need
Don't be afraid
What you feel about me
Oh-oh-oh darling
Oh darling
Oh-oh-oh darling
Oh darling
Oh-oh-oh darling
Oh darling
Oh-oh-oh darling

Don't Bring Me Down

(Johnnie Dee)

I'm on my own, nowhere to roam
I tell you baby, don't want no home
I wander round, feet off the ground
I even go from town to town
I said I think this rock is grand
Say I'll be your man
Don't bring me down, don't bring me down

I met this chick, the other day
And then to me, she said she'll stay
I get this pad, just like a cave
And then we'll have, our living made
And then I'll lead her on the ground
My head is spinning round
Don't bring me down, don't bring me down

I, I, I, I, I need a lover 'cos someone new
And then to her I will be true
I'll buy her furs and pretty things
I'll even buy a wedding ring
But until then I'll settle down
Say I'll be your man
Don't bring me down, don't bring me down
Until then I'll settle down
Say I'll be your man
Don't bring me down, don't bring me down
Don't bring me down




Don't Let Me Down And Down

(Tahra/Valmont)

Still I keep my love for you
No place to hide no way to fall
Nowhere to lie no world so wide
I'm sick and tired of telling you
Don't let me down and down and down
Don't let me down and down and down

I know there's something in the wind
That crazy balance of my mind
What kind of fool are you and I?
Scared to death and tell me why
I'm sick and tired of telling you
Don't let me down and down and down
Don't let me down and down and down

Still I keep my love for you

You made a date with destiny
You jog-jog in my memory
You haunt in mind not fade away
I'm sick and tired of telling you
Don't let me down and down and down
Don't let me down and down and down
I'm sick and tired of telling you

Still I keep my love for you
No place to hide, no way to fall
Nowhere to lie no world so wide
I'm sick and tired of telling you
Don't let me down and down and down
Don't let me down and down and down




Don't Look Down

(Iggy Pop/James Williamson)

Don't look down
They're making sorta crazy sounds
Don't look down, no
Don't know who else came to kneel
On this empty battlefield
But when I hear that crazy sound, I don't look down
From Central Park to Shanty Town
I always hear that crazy sound
From New York to Shanty Town
There's always something else
Don't look down, no

I went this morning to the cemetery
To see old Rudy Valentino buried
Lipstick traces on his name
He never looked down
'Cos they were making crazy sounds
From Central Park to Shanty Town
He always heard that crazy sound
There's always something else
Don't look down, no

When I see you standing there
I can't see the clothes you wear
I just hear that crazy sound
And I can't look down
From Central Park to Shanty Town
I've always heard that crazy sound
From New York to Shanty Town
There's always something else
Don't look down, no
Don't look down
Don't look, don't look down

No I won't be bored I won't be there
Look at life it's no piece of cake
When I hear that crazy sound
I don't look down
From Central Park to Shanty Town
I always hear that crazy sound
From New York to Shanty Town
There's always something else
Don't look down
Don't look down, no
Well, don't look, don't look down




(Don't Sit Down)

 

Yeah, yeah, baby, yeah
Yeah, yeah, baby, yeah
Yeah, yeah, baby, yeah
Yeah
Don't sit down
Don't sit down
Don't sit down




Drink To Me

(David Bowie/Iggy Pop)

(Partial lyrics)

You go out at night from your sixty dollar single down in West Hollywood
With your ripped off clothes that are bulging at the seams
I can't believe that you don't know you look ugly
I mean, are you really all that dumb?
I mean, I don't want you to be that dumb you know
But you are
You're just dumb

Straight out of the cradle and into the hole with you
He begins screaming
When I walk through the door
I'm your new breed of whore
We will now drink to me

(Recorded with Iggy Pop at Oz Studios, Hollywood, USA in May 1975).





Don't Try To Stop Me

(Performed live by Davy Jones and The Manish Boys).





Drive-In Saturday

 

Let me put my arms around your head
Gee it's hot, let's go to bed
Don't forget to turn on the light
Don't laugh babe, it'll be alright
Pour me out another phone
I'll ring and see if your friends are home
Perhaps the strange ones in the dome
Can lend us a book we can read up alone

And try to get it on like once before
When the people stared in Jagger's eyes and scored
Like the video films we saw

  His name was always Buddy
  And he'd shrug and ask to stay
  She'd sigh like Twig the Wonder Kid
  And turn her face away

  She's uncertain if she likes him
  But she knows she really loves him
  It's a crash course for the ravers
  It's a Drive-in Saturday

Jung the foreman prayed at work
Neither hands nor limbs would burst
It's hard enough to keep formation, mid this fall out saturation
Cursing at the Astronette
That stands in steel by his cabinet
He's crashing out with Sylvian
Bureau supply for ageing men
With snorting head he gazes to the shore
The once that raged the sea that raged no more
Like the video films we saw

  His name was always Buddy
  And he'd shrug and ask to stay
  And she'd sigh like Twig the Wonder Kid
  And turn her face away

  She's uncertain if she likes him
  But she knows she really loves him
  It's a crash course for the ravers
  It's a Drive-in Saturday yeah
  (repeat chorus)

Drive-in Saturday, it's a Drive-in Saturday
It's a Drive-in Saturday (repeat)
It's a (x3), yes sir (x6), do do etc, yes sir, you love me, you etc

Dum Dum Boys

(Iggy Pop/David Bowie)

(Spoken:)
  What happened to Zeke?
  He's dead out of ??
  How about Dave?
  OD'd on alcohol
  What's Rock doing?
  Oh he's living with his mother
  What about James?
  He's going straight

Things have been tough
Without the dum dum boys
I can't seem to speak
The language
I remember how they
Used to stare at the ground
They looked as if they
Put the whole world
Looked as if they put
the whole world down

The first time I saw he dum dum boys
I was fascinated
They just stood in front
Of the old drug store
I was most impressed
No one else was impressed
Not at all
And we'd sing
Da-da-da-da-da-da
Dum dum day
Where are you now my
Dum dum boys are you
Alive or dead
Have you left me the last
Of the dum dum daze
Then the sun goes down
And the boys broke down

People said we were negative
They said we'd take but
we would never give
But we'd sing da-da-da
Da-da-da dum dum day
Da-da-da-da-da dum
And hope it would pay
Da-da-da-da it's been
A dum dum dum day
A dum dum day

Now I'm looking for
The dum dum boys
Where are you now
When I need your noise

Now I'm looking for
The dum dum boys
The walls close in and
I need some noise




Eight Line Poem

 

Tactful cactus by your window
Surveys the prairie of your room
Mobile spins to its collision
Clara puts her head between her paws
They've opened shops down West side
While the cacti find a home
But the key to the city
Is in the sun that pins the branches to the sky
Ohh-woh-o







Eight Line Poem (Alternative version)

 

Tactful cactus by your window
Surveys the prairie of your room
Mobile spins to its collision
Clara puts her head between the paws
They've opened shops down on West side
While the cacti find a home
But the key to the city
Is in the sun that pins the branches to the sky
Woh-woh

Even A Fool Learns To Love

(Lyrics: David Bowie. Music: Claude François/Gilles Thibault/Jacques Revaux)

(David's lyrics for Comme D'Habitude aka My Way)

There was a time, the laughing time
I took my heart to every party
They'd point my way
"How are you today?"
"Will you make us laugh? Chase our blues away?"
Their funny man won't let them down
No, he'd dance and prance and be their clown
That time, that laughing time
When even a fool learns to love

The clown turned around
And saw her smile, oh how she loved me
She'd clap her hands and beg me stay
To make her laugh, to make her life gay
Who wants the love of all the world
When here was love in the eyes of just one girl
That day, that precious day
When even a fool learns to love

But oh, how I dreamed, a marvellous dream
Where all of the heavens or so it had seemed
With thunderous applause looked down from above
On a clown and an angel so much in love
I'll stay with my dream, it takes such a dream
And even a fool learns to love

That day, that hateful day
The joke turned stale, the game was over
Those spiteful words "Oh, go away. Who wants to play?"
"It's getting late now."
My world, my funny world
Had lost its mask and shown a broken heart
A time, a sour time
When even a fool learns to cry

But oh, how I dreamed, a marvellous dream
Where all of the heavens or so it had seemed
With thunderous applause looked down from above
On a clown and an angel so much in love
I'll stay with my dream, it takes such a dream
And even a fool learns to love




Fame

(David Bowie/John Lennon/Carlos Alomar)

Fame, makes a man take things over
Fame, lets him loose, hard to swallow
Fame, puts you there where things are hollow
Fame

Fame, not your brain, it's just the flame
That burns yourself to keep you insane
Fame

Fame, what you like is in the limo
Fame, what you get there's no tomorrow
Fame, what you need you have to borrow
Fame

Fame, "Nien! It's mine!" is just his line
To find yourself in Liverpool, crime
Fame

Ribbly de da bay, ribbly be
Ribbly be, ribbit, ribbly bay
Ribbly de da bay, ribbly bay
Ribbly bay, ribbly bay

Is it any wonder I'll reject you first?
Fame, fame, fame, fame
Is it any wonder you're far too cool to fool
Fame

Fame, bully for you, chilly for me
Gotta get a rain check on pain
Fame

Fame, fame, fame, fame, fame, fame, fame, fame, fame, fame
Fame, fame, fame, fame, fame, fame, fame, fame, fame, fame
Fame, fame, fame

Fame
What's your name?

(whispered)
  Sing Fame




Fame '90 (remix)

(David Bowie/John Lennon/Carlos Alomar)

That burns yourself to keep you insane
Fame

Fame-f-fame

Fame, what you like is in the limo
Fame, what you get is no tomorrow
Fame, what you need you have to borrow
Fame

Fame, "Nien! It's mine!" is just his line
To find yourself in Liverpool, crime
Fame

(What's your name?)

Fame

Ribbly de da bay, ribbly be
Ribbly be, ribbit, ribbly bay

Fantastic Voyage

(Lyrics: David Bowie. Music: David Bowie/Brian Eno)

In the event that this fantastic voyage
Should turn to erosion and we never get old
Remember it's true, dignity is valuable
But our lives are valuable too

We're learning to live with somebody's depression
And I don't want to live with somebody's depression
We'll get by, I suppose
It's a very modern world, but nobody's perfect
It's a moving world, but that's no reason
To shoot some of those missiles
Think of us as fatherless scum
It won't be forgotten
'Cos we'll never say anything nice again, will we?

And the wrong words make you listen
In this criminal world
Remember it's true, loyalty is valuable
But our lives are valuable too

We're learning to live with somebody's depression
And I don't want to live with somebody's depression
We'll get by I suppose
But any sudden movement I've got to write it down
They wipe out an entire race and I've got to write it down
But I'm still getting educated but I've got to write it down
And it won't be forgotten
'Cos I'll never say anything nice again, how can I?

(Recorded during the Lodger sessions at Mountain Studios, Montreux, Switzerland in 1979).





Fascination

(David Bowie/Luther Vandross)

Got to use her

Every time I feel fascination
I just can't stand still, I've got to use her
Every time I think of what you pulled me through, dear
Fascination moves sweeping near me
Still I take ya

CHORUS
  (Fascination) fascination
  (sho' nuff) fascination
  (takes a part of me) takes a part of me
  (Can a heartbeat) can a heartbeat
  (live in a fever) live in a fever?
  (raging inside of me?)
  (Fascination) fascination
  (oh, yeah) oh yeah
  (takes a part of me) takes a part of me
  (I can't help it) I can't help it
  (I've got to use her) got to use her
  (every time, ooh)
  Fascination comes around
  (Ooh-oo-ooh)

(Fascination) Your soul is calling
Like when I'm walking
Seems that everywhere I turn
I hope you're waiting for me
I know that people think
That I'm a little crazy
Ohh, better sex is fun
I think I like fascination
Still, tick

CHORUS (twice)
Ad-lib




Fashion

 

There's a brand new dance but I don't know its name
That people from bad homes do again and again
It's big and it's bland full of tension and fear
They do it over there but they don't do it here

Fashion!  Turn to the left
Fashion!  Turn to the right
Oooh, fashion!
We are the goon squad and we're coming to town
Beep-beep
Beep-beep

Listen to me - don't listen to me
Talk to me - don't talk to me
Dance with me - don't dance with me, no
Beep-beep

There's a brand new talk, but it's not very clear
Oh bop
That people from good homes are talking this year
Oh bop, fashion
It's loud and tasteless and I've heard it before
Oh bop
You shout it while you're dancing on the dance floor
Oh bop, fashion

Fashion! Turn to the left
Fashion! Right
Fashion!
We are the goon squad and we're coming to town
Beep-beep
Beep-beep

Listen to me - don't listen to me
Talk to me - don't talk to me
Dance with me - don't dance with me, no
Beep-beep
Beep-beep

REPEAT
  Oh, bop, do do do do do do do do
  Fa-fa-fa-fa fashion
  Oh, bop, do do do do do do do do
  Fa-fa-fa-fa fashion
  La-la la la la la la-la




Fill Your Heart

(Paul Conrad Rose/Paul Williams)

Fill your heart with love today
Don't play the game of time
Things that happened in the past
Only happened in your mind
Only in your mind - ohh forget your mind
And you'll be free - yeah
The writing's on the wall
Free - yeah, and you can know it all
If you choose - just remember
Lovers never lose
'Cos they are free of thoughts unpure
And of thoughts unkind
Gentleness clears the soul
Love cleans the mind
And makes it free - free

Oh happiness is happening
The dragons have been bled
Gentleness is everywhere
Fear's just in your head
Only in your head
Fear is in your head
Only in your head
So forget your head
And you'll be free
The writing's on the wall
Free - yeah, and you can know it all
If you choose, just remember
Lovers never lose
'Cos they are free of thoughts unpure
And of thoughts unkind
Gentleness clears the soul
Love will clean your mind
And make you free!!!

Free - yea' - yeah-yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah-yeah (repeat) Free - yea'




Five Years

 

Pushing thru' the market square, so many mothers sighing
News had just come over, we had five years left to cry in
News guy wept and told us, Earth was really dying
Cried so much his face was wet, then I knew he was not lying
I heard telephones, opera house, favourite melodies
I saw boys, toys, electric irons and TV's
My brain hurt like a warehouse, it had no room to spare
I had to cram so many things to store everything in there
And all the fat-skinny people, and all the tall-short people
And all the nobody people, and all the somebody people
I never thought I'd need so many people

A girl my age went off her head, hit some tiny children
If the black hadn't a-pulled her off, I think she would have killed them
A soldier with a broken arm, fixed his stare to the wheels of a Cadillac
A cop knelt and kissed the feet of a priest, and a queer threw up at the sight of that
I think I saw you in an ice-cream parlour, drinking milk shakes cold and long
Smiling and waving and looking so fine, don't think you knew you were in this song
And it was cold and it rained so I felt like an actor
And I thought of Ma and I wanted to get back there
Your face, your ace, the way that you talk
I kiss you, you're beautiful, I want you to walk

We've got five years, stuck on my eyes
Five years, what a surprise
We've got five years, my brain hurts a lot
Five years, that's all we've got
We've got five years, what a surprise
Five years, stuck on my eyes
We've got five years, my brain hurts a lot
Five years that's all we've got
We've got five years, stuck on my eyes
Five years, what a surprise
We've got five years, my brain hurts a lot
Five years, that's all we've got
We've got five years, what a surprise
We've got five years, stuck on my eyes
We've got five years, my brain hurts a lot
Five years that's all we've got
Five years, five years, five years, five years

Friday On My Mind

(George Reburn Young/Harry Vanda)

Monday morning feels so bad
Everybody seems to nag me
Coming Tuesday I feel better
Even my old man looks good
Wednesday just don't go
Thursday goes too slow
I've got Friday on my mind

CHORUS
  (See my baby) Gonna have fun in the city (feel like fucking you)
  (Do my baby screw) Be with my girl she's so pretty (all I want to do)
  (I'm not crazy) She looks fine tonight
  (Zoom zoom zoom x3) She is outta sight to me (so divine)
  (Tonight)  I spend my bread
  (Tonight)  I'll lose my head
  (Tonight)  I've got to get tonight
  Monday I'll have Friday on my mind

Do the five day drag once more (Monday blue)
Know of nothing else that bugs me
More than working for the rich men (poor man, beggar man, thief)
Hey I'll change that scene one day
Today I might be mad
Tomorrow I'll be glad
'Cos I'll have Friday on my mind

CHORUS

(See my baby) (feel like fucking you)
Gonna have fun
(zoom zoom zoom)
Be with my girl (repeat ad lib.)

Future Legend

 

And in the death
As the last few corpses lay rotting on the slimy thoroughfare
The shutters lifted an inch in Temperance Building
High on Poacher's Hill
And red mutant eyes gazed down on Hunger City
No more big wheels

Fleas the size of rats sucked on rats the size of cats
And ten thousand peoploids split into small tribes
Coveting the highest of the sterile skyscrapers
Like packs of dogs assaulting the glass fronts of Love Me Avenue
Ripping and rewrapping mink and shiny silver fox, now legwarmers
Family badge of sapphire and cracked emerald
Any day now

The Year of the Diamond Dogs

(Recorded during the Diamond Dogs sessions at the Olympic Studios, Barnes, London SW13 in 1974).

Get Real

(Lyrics: David Bowie. Music: David Bowie/Brian Eno)

Oh hideous year
We angels of lead
We're dead, we're sick
Hanging by thread
Get real
Get real

You can't stop meaningful teenage cries
From deep behind fifty year old eyes
Get real
Get real

CHORUS
  I'm scared to touch
  Too tense to be undone
  I walk the streets
  Not expecting morning sun

Against the voice of doom
Failures fall all over town

I guess I should, I feel I should
Get real
Get real

What's up?
What happened when I wasn't around?
Who did what?
What went down?

Get real
Get real

Think about myself it happens to me
It happens in the tunnel when I let myself feel

Get real
Get real

CHORUS

I feel it all through breakdowns falling all over town
I feel I should, I guess I should

Get real
Get real
Get real
Get real

The dazzle of light
The rape of life
The seed, the curse
The jazz of life

Get real
Get real

Get real
Get real

Girls

(Lyrics: David Bowie. Music: David Bowie/Erdal Kizilcay)

Girls
They come and they go
They kiss
Come and they go
Like breeze
Brushing my cheek
Like pain
Like the tears on my face

Girls
They come and they go
Like spirits
They vanish at dawn
My heart
Suspended in time
Like you
Vanish like tears in the rain

Girls
They take their loves away
Like spirits
Living so far away

Girls
Pretending to break down and cry
Girls
Whispering wind
What are they giving away

We used to be so happy
Remember, remember
So happy
I never knew
How lonely
How lonely
How lonely I could feel

Girls
They come and they go
They kiss
They come and they go
Like spirits
Brushing my cheek
Like pain
Like the tears on my face

Girls
They take their loves away
Like spirits
Living so far away

Girls
Pretending to break down and cry
Girls
Whispering wind
What are they giving away

We used to be so happy
Remember, remember
So happy
I never knew
How lonely
How lonely
How lonely I could feel

Glad I've Got Nobody

 

Well, I'm glad I've got nobody
Yes, I'm glad I've got nobody
Oh, I'm glad I've got nobody
To be loved by me

All the world couldn't take your place
Another girl, another face
Wouldn't be the type of thing
Know I've found it out and see
Another girl standing next to me
Oh no, just you
Oh no, just you

Well, I couldn't find another you
Everywhere I go, I see your name
I couldn't find another you
Everywhere I go, it's just the same

And I'm glad I've got nobody
Oh, I'm glad I've got nobody
Yes, I'm glad I've got nobody

Well, I'm glad I've got nobody
Oh, I'm glad I've got nobody
And I'm glad I've got nobody
To be loved by me

All the world couldn't take your place
Another girl, another face
Wouldn't be the type of thing
Know I've found it out and see
Another girl standing next to me
Oh no, just you
Oh no, just you

Well, I couldn't find another you
Everywhere I go, I see your name
Well, I couldn't find another you
Everywhere I go, it's just the same

And I'm glad I've got nobody
Yes, I'm glad I've got nobody
Really glad I've got nobody, oh

(Demo track recorded in 1965 appears on Early On 1964-1966).






Glass Spider

 

Up until one century ago there lived
In the Zi Duang provence of eastern country
A glass-like spider
Having devoured its prey it would drape the skeletons over its web
In weeks creating a macabre shrine of remains
Its web was also unique in that it had many layers
Like floors of a building

At the top of this palace-like place, assembled with almost apparent care
Were tiny, shining objects, glass, beads, dew-drops
One could almost call it an altar
When the breeze blew through this construction
It produced sounds of wailing, crying
Tiny wails, tiny cries

The baby spiders would get scared and search frantically for their mother
But the Glass Spider would have long gone
Having known that the babies would survive somehow on their own
Oh the Glass Spider had blue eyes almost like a human's
They shed tears at the wintered turn of the centuries

Don't you hear this wasted cry? Life is over you
(Mummy come back 'cos the water's all gone)
But you've seen who's in Heaven. Is there anyone in hell?
(Gone gone the waters all gone, Mummy come back 'cos it's dark now)

Ah ah ah ah
Ah ah ah ah ahh

Take care, take care
Mummy come back 'cos the water's all gone
Somewhere she glows divine. Somewhere she wakes alone
But do you promise in your lovin' eye. God it's dark now
(Mummy come back 'cos it's dark now)
Jah Jah Jah Jah Jah
Jah Jah Jah Jah Jah

Jah Jah Jah Jah Jah

Gone, gone the water's all gone
Mummy come back 'cos the water's all gone
Stay low on the ground, the fire can drive you, savage and afraid
Speeding at the dawn, come along before the animals awake
Gone, gone, the water's all gone
Mummy come back 'cos it's dark now

Run, run, moving all night, rivers to the left
If your mother don't love you then the riverbed might
Gone, gone, the water's all gone
Mummy come back 'cos the water's all gone

Jah Jah Jah Jah Jah
Jah Jah Jah Jah Jah

Gone, gone the water's all gone
Mummy come back 'cos the water's all gone
Gone, gone the water's all gone
Mummy come back 'cos the water's all gone
Gone, gone the water's all gone
Mummy come back 'cos the water's all gone

Mummy come back 'cos it's dark now
Ah ah ah ah
Ah ah ah ah ahh
Mummy come back 'cos the water's all gone
Jah Jah Jah Jah Jah
Jah Jah Jah Jah Jah
Mummy come back 'cos it's dark now
Jah Jah Jah Jah Jah
Jah Jah Jah Jah Jah
Mummy come back 'cos the water's all gone
Jah Jah Jah Jah Jah
Jah Jah Jah Jah Jah
Mummy come back 'cos it's dark now
Ah ah ah ah
Ah ah ah ah ahh
Mummy come back 'cos it's dark now

Go Now

(Larry 'Bessie' Banks/Milton Bennett)

We've already said
  (1: goodbye 2: so long)

Since you gotta go, oh you had better
Go now    go now, go now
(Go now)    Before you'll see me cry
I don't want you to tell me just what you intend to do now
'Cos how many times do I have to tell you darlin', darlin'
I'm still in love (3: still in love) with you now
Whoa-oh-oh-oh

I don't wanna see you go, oh you had better
Go now    go now, go now
(Go now)    Don't you even try
Tellin' me that you really don't want it to end this way
'Cos darlin', darlin', can't you see I want you to stay
Yeah, yeah

(repeat verse 1)

I don't wanna see you go but darlin', you better go now

(Performed live with Tin Machine during the 1991-92 'It's My Life' World Tour, lead vocals by Tony Sales).





God Knows I'm Good

 

I was walking through the counters of a national concern
And a cash machine was spitting by my shoulder
And I saw the multitude of faces, honest, rich and clean
As the merchandise exchanged and money roared
And a woman hot with worry slyly slipped a tin of stewing steak
Into the paper bag at her side
And her face was white with fear in case her actions were observed
So she closed her eyes to keep her conscience blind

Crying
  "God knows I'm good
    God knows I'm good
    God knows I'm good
    God may look the other way today

    God knows I'm good
    God knows I'm good
    God knows I'm good
    God may look the other way today"

Then she moved toward the exit clutching tightly at her paper bag
Perspiration trickled down her forehead
And her heart it leapt inside her as the hand laid on her shoulder
She was led away bewildered and amazed
Through her deafened ears the cash machines were shrieking on the counter
As her escort asked her softly for her name
And a crowd of honest people rushed to help a tired old lady
Who had fainted to the whirling wooden floor

Crying
  "God knows I'm good
    God knows I'm good
    God knows I'm good
    Surely God won't look the other way

    God knows I'm good
    God knows I'm good
    God knows I'm good
    Surely God won't look the other way"




God Only Knows

(Brian Wilson/Tony Asher)

If you should ever leave me
My life would still go on believe me
The world could show nothing to me
So what good would living do me
God only knows what I'd be without you

I may not always love you
But as long as there are stars above you
You'll never need to doubt it
I'll make you so sure about it
God only knows what I'd be without you




Golden Years

 

Golden years, gold whop whop whop
Golden years, gold whop whop whop
Golden years, gold whop whop whop

Don't let me hear you say life's taking you nowhere, angel
Come get up my baby
Look at that sky, life's begun
Nights are warm and the days are young
Come get up my baby

There's my baby, lost that's all
Once I'm begging you save her little soul
Golden years, gold whop whop whop
Come get up my baby

Last night they loved you, opening doors and pulling some strings, angel
Come get up my baby
In walked luck and you looked in time
Never look back, walk tall, act fine
Come get up my baby

I'll stick with you baby for a thousand years
Nothing's gonna touch you in these golden years, gold
Golden years, gold whop whop whop
Come get up my baby

Some of these days, and it won't be long
Gonna drive back down where you once belonged
In the back of a dream car twenty foot long
Don't cry my sweet, don't break my heart
Doing all right, but we gotta get smart
Wish upon, wish upon, day upon day, I believe oh Lord
I believe all the way
Come get up my baby

There's my baby, lost that's all
Once I'm begging you save her little soul
Golden years, gold whop whop whop
Come get up my baby

Don't let me hear you say life's taking you nowhere, angel
Come get up my baby
Run for the shadows, run for the shadows
Run for the shadows in these golden years

I'll stick with you baby for a thousand years
Nothing's gonna touch you in these golden years, gold
Golden years, gold whop whop whop (11 times)

Good Morning Girl

 

Hey, hey, good morning girl
Hey, hey, good morning girl
Hey, hey, good morning girl
But I can't pass this time of day

'Cos I'm on my way to rest my head
And I've lost the mind that I used to have
And I don't have a dime to spare

Hey, hey, good morning girl
Hey, hey, good morning girl
Hey, hey, good morning girl
But I can't pass this time of day

So go tell the man that collects the dues
That you saw a guy without any shoes
Who would do the job if he was built that way

Hey, hey, good morning girl
Hey, hey, good morning girl
Hey, hey, good morning girl
But I can't pass this time of day, no
I can't pass this time of day

'Cos I'm on my way to rest my head
And I've lost the mind that I used to have
I don't have a dime to spare

Hey, hey, good morning girl
Hey, hey, good morning girl
Hey, hey, good morning girl
But I can't pass this time of day

So go tell the man that collects the dues
That you saw a guy without any shoes
Who would do the job if he was built that way

Hey, hey, good morning girl
Hey, hey, good morning girl
Hey, hey, good morning girl
But I can't pass this time of day, no
I can't pass this time of day




Goodbye Mr. Ed

(David Bowie/Hunt Sales)

The ghost of Manhattoes
Shrieking as they fall
From AT&T
Someone sees it all
Goodbye Mr. Ed
Andy's skull enshrined
In a shopping mall near Queens
Someone sees it all

Icarus takes his pratfall
Bruegel on his head
Goodbye Mr. Ed

Four and twenty black kids
Some of them are blind
Someone sees it all
Tolerance of violence
By the fellows with no heads
Goodbye Mr. Ed

CHORUS (twice)
  Some things are so big
  They make no sense
  Histories so small
  People are so dense
  Someone sees it all
  Goodbye Mr. Ed

Never mind the Pistols
They laid the Golem eggs
Others came to hatch them
Outside the pale
Someone sees it all
Goodbye Mr. Ed




Got My Mojo Working

(McKinley Morganfield)

 

(Performed live by Davie Jones and The King Bees).





Growin' Up

(Bruce Springsteen)

Here we go, a 1, 2, 3, 4

Well I stood stoned-like at midnight
Suspended in my masquerade
I combed my hair till it was just right
And commanded the night brigade
I was open to pain and crossed by the rain
And I walked on a crooked crutch
I strolled all alone through a fallout zone
Came out with my soul untouched

I hid in the clouded wrath of the crowd
But when they said "Sit down" I stood up
Ooh-ooh growin' up

The flag of piracy flew from my mast
My sails were set wing to wing
I had a jukebox graduate for first mate
She couldn't sail but she sure could sing
I pushed the B-52 and bombed 'em with the blues
With my gear set stubborn on standing
I broke all the rules, strafed my old high school
Never once gave thought to landing, no

An' I hid in the clouded warmth of the crowd
But when they said "Come down" I threw up
Ooh-ooh growin' up

I took month-long vacations in the stratosphere
And you know it's really hard to hold your breath
And I swear I lost everything I ever loved or feared
I was the cosmic kid in full costume dress
Well my feet finally took root in the Earth
But I got a nice little place in the stars
And I swear I found the key to the universe
In the engine of an old parked car

I hid in the mother breast of the crowd
But when they said "Move down" I moved up
Ooh-ooh, don' cha know that I'm growin' up
I said Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, I can't help it that I'm growin' up 



Gunman

(Adrian Belew/David Bowie)

Gunman
My sort of star
They put you there
You're all of us now
You're all over town
On wrappers and cans
You're bigger than life
You're braver than dad
You're a gunman
Holding your own
You're a gunman
Never alone

Gunman
Leader of packs
Shadow of death
Killer in chic
Never betrayed
Friend of our kids
You're a gunman
Holding your own
You're a gunman
Never alone

Gunman
Gunman
Trader in arms
Kids on the streets
Buying your charms

Gunman
My sort of star
We put you there
You're all of us now
You're all over town
On wrappers and cans
You're bigger than life
You're braver than dad
You're a gunman
Holding your own
You're a gunman
You're never alone

Gunman
Gunman

Gunman
My sort of star
We're bleeding for you
We put you there
What would you give
You're all of us now
We're burning for you
You're all over our town, gunman
You're on wrappers and cans
You're bigger than life
And we're dying for you
And you're braver than dad, gunman
Your women are dogs
But they're braver than you

We're bleeding for you
What would you give
We're burning for you
Gunman

We're bleeding for you
We invented you
What would you give
Now we gotta live with you
We're burning for you
You're more solid than a rock
Gunman
A rock of cocaine or crack
Gunman
Or ice or death
Like a rock of death
Like a gravestone
Gunman

  Baby

Spaceboy, you're sleepy now
Your silhouette is so stationary

Cover you

Hammerhead

(David Bowie/Hunt Sales)

I should never call her
Heartbreakers, never kill
But she's been New Zealand on another trip
Have you felt like Dixon
And Ray, and Ali?

Hit me
Hit me baby
On the camera
Take me in
I'm going down
Hit me baby
You win
You're the very tough with a long past

You're a hammerhead
Sweet thing
Goldwyn Drive
Keep it all stuck on here
She's all black or white
Don't tell her where I'm livin'

Hit me
Hit me baby
She got me ruined
She's a bore
She fell apart
Oh, oh, ooh
She's so fabulous

It was life at the top
It would be I

She's a hammerhead
Sweet thing
She's a hammerhead
Mention her hammerhead
Oh, oh, ooh




Hang On To Yourself

Pray to the light machine
She wants my honey not my money she's a funky-thigh collector
Layin' on 'lectric dreams

CHORUS
  Well come on, come on, we've really got a good thing going
  Well come on, well come on, if you think we're gonna make it

But then we move like Tigers on Vaseline
Well the bitter comes out better on a stolen guitar
You're the blessed, we're the Spiders from Mars

  Well come on, well come on, we've really got a good thing going
  Well come on, well come on, if you think we're gonna make it
  You better hang on to yourself

Harlem Shuffle

(Relf/Nelson)

You move it to the left and you go for yourself
You move it to the right if it takes all night
Now take it kinda slow with a whole lotta soul
Don't move it too fast. Just make it last

You scratch just like a monkey
Yeah ya do - real cool
You slide it to the limbo
How low can you go?
Now come on, baby
Don't fall down on me now

Just move it right here to the Harlem Shuffle
Do the Harlem Shuffle

Hitch, hitch-hike, baby, across the floor
I can't stand it no more
Now come on baby - now get into your slide
Just ride, ride, ride, lil' pony ride

Do the Harlem Shuffle... do the Monkey Shine
Shake a tail feather, baby

(Performed live by David Bowie and The Buzz).





He Was Alright - (early version of Lady Stardust)

 

 





Heathen (The Rays)

 

Steel on the skyline
Sky made of glass
Made for a real world
All things must pass
Oo-o

Waiting for something
Looking for someone
Is there no reason?
Have I stared too long?
Oo-o, Oo-o

You say you'll leave me

And when the sun is low
And the rays high
I can see it now
I can feel it die
Oo-o, Oo-o




Heaven's In Here

 

Baby I dream between the blade and the tongue
Of the rose on your cheek, the wounded and dumb
We stumble and fall, we stumble and fall
Skin on skin but there's heaven...

CHORUS
  Heaven's in here
  Heaven's in here
  Among the twilight and stars
  Like a rocket to Mars
  Heaven's in here

The first and the last are telling it all
Telling you loud but selling it small
I'm taking a swing at this shadow of mine
Crucifix hangs an' my heart's in my mouth
But it's here

CHORUS

Hitting it one time
Uh-uh-uh-uh-uh
Heaven in here

Heaven lies between your marbled thighs
The rustle of your falling gown
We stumble and fall like tragedy falls
We stumble and twirl there's heaven in here
We stumble and fall uncertain we fall
It's flesh on flesh but there's heaven...
Heaven's in here

CHORUS

You'll dance to my tongue, we'll dance on the sun
We're the twilight and stars
And there's heaven in here

Heaven




"Helden"

(Lyrics: David Bowie. Music: David Bowie/Brian Eno. Translation: Antonia Maas)

Du
Koenntest du schwimmen
Wie Delphine
Delphine es tun
Niemand gibt uns eine chance
Doch wir koennen siegen
Fuer immer und immer
Und wir sind dann Helden
Fuer einen tag

Ich
Ich bin dann Koenig
Und Du
Du Koenigin
Auch wenn sie
Unschlagbar scheinen
Werden wir Helden
Fuer einen tag
Wir sind dann wir
An diesem tag

Ich
Ich glaub' das zu traeumen
die Mauer
Im Ruecken war kalt
Schuesse peitschen die Luft
Doch wir kuessen
Als ob nichts geschieht
Und die scham fiel auf ihre seite
Oh, wir koennen sie schlagen
Fuer alle Zeiten
Dann sind wir Helden
Nur diesen tag
Dann sind wir Helden
Dann sind wir Helden
Dann sind wir Helden

(Recorded during the "Heroes" sessions at Hansa Tonstudio, Berlin, Germany in 1977. German version).





Hello Stranger

(Barbara Lewis)

  (shoo-bop, shoo-bop)

Hello, stranger
(ooh) It seems so good to see you back again
How long has it been?

  (shoo-bop, shoo-bop, my baby, ooh)
It seems like a mighty long time

Oh-uh-oh, I my, my, my, my

Remember that's the way it used to be
Ooh, it seems like a mighty long time
  (shoo-bop, shoo-bop, my baby, ooh)
It seems like a mighty long time

Oh-ahh-uh-oh
If you're not gonna stay

It seems like a mighty long time

Henry And The H-Bomb

(Ian Hunter)

Down in the basement
Stands his brother on a Fender bass guitar went
You're looking for a suitable replacement
To play for Henry and the H-Bombs

Don't you know he comes about the flowers
He can talk for hours and for hours
About the rain and the showers
But his whole trip is the power

There'll be (?) in the meanwhile
Anything (?) can change in a (?)
That's no way to treat them all
Halfway making it, halfway faking it
Henry and the H-Bombs
Der Der Der Der Der Der
Where we got the name from
All I see (?) too long
After seeing sweet Henry and the H-Bombs

You know he comes on like the flowers
He can talk for hours and for hours
About the rain and the showers
How it'll change in an hour

Get along in the meanwhile
Have another change in a wee while
That's no way to treat them all
Halfway making it, halfway taking it
Henry and the H-Bombs
Der Der Der Der Der Der
Where we got the name from
(?)
Making it with Henry and the H-Bombs


(Demo recorded at Trident Studios in May 1972 with Mott The Hoople allegedly with David on guitar. Appears on 'The Ballad of Mott: A Retrospective' - Sony/Legacy C2K 46973).





Here Comes The Night

(Bert Berns)

Ohhhhh... here it comes
Here comes the night
Yeah, here comes the night
Oh, yeah (here comes the night)

I can see right out my window walking down the street my girl
With another guy
His arms around her like it used to be with me
Oh it makes me want to die

CHORUS
  Yeah, here it comes
  Here comes the night
  Yeah, here comes the night
  Yeah... (here comes the night)

There they go, funny how they look so good together
Wonder what is wrong with me?
Why can't I accept the fact she's chosen him
And simply let them be?

CHORUS
  Here it comes
  Here comes the night
  Here comes the night
  Yeah... (here comes the night)

Oh she's with him he's turning down the lights
But now he's holding her the way I used to do
I can see her closing her eyes and telling him lies
Exactly like she told me too

CHORUS
  Oh here it comes
  Here comes the night
  Oh, here, here comes the night
  Yeah... (here comes the night)

Here, here comes the night (repeat ad inf.)




He's A Goldmine

 

 





Here Today, Gone Tomorrow

(Bonner/Harris/Jones/Middlebrooks/Robinson/Satchell/Webster)

You're like a sailor with a girl on every shore
Stay with her now for they won't see you no more
Like a Gypsy forever on the run
Stay for a while you look for a whore

Like that sailor leaves, come back again
Stay for a while and they won't see you again
Like that Gypsy caravan, forever on the run
You stay for a while, then you pick up and go

CHORUS
  That's how you show your love for me
  That's how you show your love for me, you're like
  Here today, gone tomorrow
  Each time you come, you leave a little sorrow, you're like
  Here today, gone tomorrow
  Each time you come, you leave a little sorrow

You're like that big big star that's torn the town apart
Leaving everyone to console their aching heart
Like that snow that fell, looks so wrong and out of place
Stay for a while and then you leave without a trace

That's 'xactly like that star that tore the town apart
Leaving everyone to console their aching heart
Like that snow that fell, looks so wrong and out of place
Stay for a while leave without a trace

That's how you show your love for me
That's how you show your love for me
Here today, gone tomorrow
Each time you come, you leave a little sorrow, you're like
Here today, gone tomorrow
Each time you stay, you leave a little sorrow

Here today, gone tomorrow, hmmm
You're like
Here today, gone tomorrow
Each time you come, you leave a little sorrow
Here today, gone tomorrow
Each time you come, you leave a little sorrow

Here today baby
Here today, but gone tomorrow




"Heroes"

(Lyrics: David Bowie. Music: David Bowie/Brian Eno)

I, I will be king
And you, you will be queen
Though nothing will drive them away
We can beat them, just for one day
We can be Heroes, just for one day

And you, you can be mean
And I, I'll drink all the time
'Cos we're lovers, and that is a fact
Yes we're lovers, and that is that

Though nothing, will keep us together
We could steal time, just for one day
We can be Heroes, for ever and ever
What d'you say?

I, I wish you could swim
Like the dolphins, like dolphins can swim
Though nothing, nothing will keep us together
We can beat them, for ever and ever
Oh we can be Heroes, just for one day

I, I will be king
And you, you will be queen
Though nothing will drive them away
We can be Heroes, just for one day
We can be us, just for one day

I, I can remember (I remember)
Standing, by the wall (by the wall)
And the guns, shot above our heads (over our heads)
And we kissed, as though nothing could fall (nothing could fall)
And the shame, was on the other side
Oh we can beat them, for ever and ever
Then we could be Heroes, just for one day

We can be Heroes
We can be Heroes
We can be Heroes
Just for one day
We can be Heroes

We're nothing, and nothing will help us
Maybe we're lying, then you better not stay
But we could be safer, just for one day

Oh-oh-oh-ohh, oh-oh-oh-ohh, just for one day

(Recorded during the "Heroes" sessions at Hansa Tonstudio, Berlin, Germany in 1977).





"Héros"

(Lyrics: David Bowie. Music: David Bowie/Brian Eno. Translation: ???)

Moi, je souhaiterai que tu nages
Comme les dauphins
Les dauphins savent nager
Bien que rien
Nous gardera ensemble
Nous les vaincrons
Les vaincrons a jamais
On peut être un héros
Pour juste une journée

Moi
Je serai un roi
Et toi
Tu seras ma reine
Bien que rien
Rien ne les chassera
On pourra être un héro
Pour juste une journée
On pourrait être nous
Pour juste une journée

Je
Je me rapelle
(je me rapelle bien)
Debout près du mur
(près du mur)
Les gardes tireront au delà de nous
(au delà de nous)
Et je t'embrassais
Comme si rien ne tombait
(rien ne tombait)
Et la honte
Etait de l'autre côté
Oh nous les vaincrons
Nous les vaincrons à jamais
On pourra être un héros
Pour juste une journée

On peut être un héro
On peut être un héro
On peut être un héro
Pour juste une journée
On peut être un héro

(Recorded during the "Heroes" sessions at Hansa Tonstudio, Berlin, Germany in 1977. French version).

Hey Ma Get Papa

(David Bowie/Mick Ronson)

There I stood like soap on heat
While blood ran thick past both my quaking feet
Into the street

J.J. Dean and Pigsty Paul, just coughed and grinned
And sank into the pack, don't turn me back

J.J. had blessed us
Cramped me up with salt, Tequila, lemon peel  (C'mon, c'mon)
My heart began to reel  (C'mon, Let's do it again)

Hey Ma Get Papa
Soon you'll have no son to bitch
You're gonna cry  (C'mon, c'mon, c'mon)
I've left a man to die.  (I've left some man to die)

(Speaks when he screams), with his old black jeans
And a spike from the ground, and all I saw was red
When he touched my head

So I picked up a spike, that once was a fence
And I stuck it in his side, and all we saw was red, oh Ma!
He must be dead

Good God, we cracked out
Never threw up until we had run, ten blocks or more  (C'mon, c'mon)
Then we really poured   (C'mon, Let's do it again)

Hey Ma Get Papa
Soon you'll have no son to bitch
You're gonna cry  (C'mon, c'mon, c'mon)
I've left some man to die  (I've left some man to die)




Hideaway

(Iggy Pop/David Bowie)

I need to touch
A live unbeaten earth
So that's where I'm going

I know a town
In North-West Mexico
Where the sun is gold
And life exists
Hideaway, hideaway, truly
Hideaway, hideaway, truly

My country got
Raped by big industry
We'll just have to wing it

The concrete strips
Raw creed and king TV
They say, 'So what'
I say 'So this'
Hideaway, hideaway, truly
Hideaway, hideaway, truly

I can hear children's voices
Ringing in a yard
When I hear children's voices
My feelings aren't so hard

Your honest face
Your quiet simple grace
You are one thing
I will not waste
Hideaway, hideaway, truly
Hideaway, hideaway, truly




Hold On! I'm Comin'

(Isaac Hayes aka Ed Lee/David Porter)

(Chorus)

Don't you ever feel sad
Lean on me when times are bad
When the day comes and you're down
In a river of trouble and about to drown

  Just hold on, I'm comin'
  Hold on, I'm comin'

I'm goin' my way, your lover
If you get cold I'll be your cover
Don't have to worry 'cos I'm here
No need to suffer baby, I'm here

  'Cos hold on, I'm comin'
  Hold on, I'm comin'
  Hold on, I'm comin'
  Hold on, I'm comin'

  Reach out to me for satisfaction
  Call my name now for quick reaction
Don't you ever feel sad?
Lean on me when times are bad
When the day comes and you're down
In a river of trouble and about to drown

  Just hold on, I'm comin'
  Hold on, I'm comin'

  Just hold on, I'm comin'
  Hold on, I'm comin'

  Just hold on, I'm comin'
  Hold on, I'm comin'

(Performed live by David Bowie and The Buzz).





Hole In The Ground (demo)

 

(No lyrics)
You can stay at home alone
Don't even answer the phone
I will come when it's right
And I won't stay all night

For I see something bad
Just a-looking above me
Just a-looking above me

I see a hole in the ground
I see a hole in the ground
But there's no-one around
But the sheets on the street
But I'm quick on my feet
And I'm running to you
Just a-looking above me
Just a-looking above me

There's a hole in the ground
There's a hole in the ground
But there's no-one around
But the sheets on the street
And I'm quick on my feet
And I'm running to you
Just a-looking above me
Just a-looking above me
Just a-looking above me
Just a-looking above me


(Demo acetate recording from either late 1969, 1970 or early 1971 with George Underwood (vocals), David Bowie (guitar), Herbie Flowers (bass), Tim Renwick (guitar) and Terry Cox (drums). The b-side was a non-vocal version of the same song, but was to be entitled 'Lump On The Hill'. Hole In The Ground was re-recorded for the March 2001 unreleased album Toy).





Hole In The Ground (2000 version)

 

You can stay at home alone
You can stay at home alone
Don't even answer the phone
I will come when it's right
And I won't stay all night

For I see something bad
Just a-looking above me
Just a-looking above me

I see a hole in the ground
I see a hole in the ground
But there's no-one around
But the sheets on the street
But I'm quick on my feet
And I'm running to you
Just a-looking above me
Just a-looking above me

There's a hole in the ground
There's a hole in the ground
But there's no-one around
But the sheets on the street
And I'm quick on my feet
And I'm running to you
Just a-looking above me
Just a-looking above me
Just a-looking above me
Just a-looking above me

Holy Holy (1971 version)

 

Listen lady, let me lie low, lie low with you
To be a lie-high-high-high
My high-high lie-low lie
Slowly, it gets good and holy
Helping one another, just a righteous brother
Nightime, give me back the nightime
I don't wanna be angel, just a little bit evil
I feel a devil in me

Holy, holy
Hold on to anyone, hold on to anyone
But just let me be
Holy, holy
Hold on to anyone, hold on to anyone
But let go of me

Listen lady, let me lie low, lie low with you
To be a lie-high-high-high
High-high oh my

Holy, holy
Hold on to anyone, hold on to anyone
But just let me be
Holy, holy
Hold on to anyone, hold on to anyone
But let go of me

Listen baby, let me lie low, lie low with you
To be lie-high-high-high
High-high lie-low lie
Slowly, it's good and holy
Helping one another, just a righteous brother
Lifetime, give me back my lifetime
I don't want to be an angel, just a little bit evil
Feel the devil in me

Hold on to anyone, hold on to anyone
But just let me be

Hold on to anyone, hold on to anyone

Hoochie Coochie Man

(Willie Dixon)

Gypsy woman told my momma, before I was born
You got a boy-child comin', gonna be a son-of-a-gun
Gonna make these pretty women, jump and shout
And the world will only know, a-what it's all about

Y'know I'm here
Everybody knows I'm here
And I'm the hoochie-coochie man
Everybody knows I'm here

On the seventh hour, of the seventh day
On the seventh month, the seventh doctor said:
"He's born for good luck, and I know you see
Got seven hundred dollars, and don't you mess with me"

Y'know I'm here
Everybody knows I'm here
And I'm the hoochie coochie man
Everybody knows I'm here

Gypsy woman told my momma
Said "Ooh, what a boy he gonna
make so many women jump and shout for joy"

Y'know I'm here
Everybody knows I'm here
And I'm the hoochie-coochie man
Everybody knows I'm here

Gypsy woman told my momma, before I was born
"You got a boy-child comin', gonna be a son-of-a-gun
Gonna make these pretty women, jump and shout
And the world will only know, a-what it's all about"

Y'know I'm here
Everybody knows I'm here
And I'm the hoochie-coochie man
Everybody knows I'm here

I got a black cat bone, I got a mojo too
I got John the Conqueror, I'm gonna mess with you
I'm gonna make you, pretty girl, lead me by the hand
Then the world will know, the hoochie coochie man

(Performed live by Davie Jones and The King Bees).





Hop Frog

(Lou Reed)

Well they call me a juicy hop-frog
You can see me in any wood bog
Don't you know that they call me the hop-frog
Hopping frog

I'm a hop-frog
A hop-frog
They call me the hop-frog
Hop, hop-frog

They call me the hop-frog
See me in any wood bog
Don't you know that call me a hop-frog
Hop-frog

They call me the hop-frog
See me in a wood bog
They're calling me a hop-frog
Hop-frog

You can see me in a ballroom
You can see me in a bedroom
You can see me in the woods
Hop, hop-frog

They call me the hop-frog
They call you the hop-frog
Well they call you the hop-frog
Hop, hop-frog

Frog

(Sung by David Bowie, appears on Lou Reed's album The Raven).





How Lucky You Are

 

VERSE
  When you speak you speak to me
  When you sleep you sleep by me
  When you wake you wake with me
  When you walk you follow two steps behind

Realise terror stalking, ever grasping sinking for me
It wasn't love it was the fix of never wanting me
Now I'm gone, you're tossing and turning in your sleep
That's the name of the game, of the game, of the game

Cry, Miss Peculiar
You'll cry all the more, now I'm gone
I was the monkey on your back
Take a look at how lucky you are

VERSE

Cry, cry, Miss Peculiar
You'll cry all the more, now I'm gone
I was the monkey on your back
Take a look at how lucky you are

Some days are heaven, I will not deny
Probing the daylight cascading the skyline
Tripping and diving and losing it all
Back came the night time, I was waiting for more things

Cry, cry, Miss Peculiar
You'll cry all the more, now that I'm gone
I was the devil monkey on your back
Take a look at how lucky you are

VERSE




Hung Up

(??)

 

(Performed live by David Bowie and The Buzz).





Hung Up On This Girl

 

 







Hurt

(Trent Reznor)

I hurt myself today
To see if I still feel
I focus on the pain
The only thing that's real
The needle tears a hole
The old familiar sting
Try to kill it all away
But I remember everything

What have I become?
My sweetest friend
Everyone I know
Goes away in the end

And you could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt

I wear this crown of shit
Upon my liar's chair
Full of broken thoughts
I cannot repair
Beneath these stains of time
The feelings disappear
You are somewhere else
But I am still right here
What have I become?
My sweetest friend
Everyone I know
Goes away in the end

And you could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt

If I could start again
A million miles away
I would keep myself
I would find a way

(Performed live with Nine Inch Nails during the Outside World Tour 1995 in the USA).





I Ain't Got You

(Calvin Carter)

I got a Maserati GT
With snakeskin upholstery
I got a charge account at Goldblatt's
But I ain't got you

I got a closet full of clothes
But no matter where it goes
It keeps a ring in the nose
But I ain't got you

I got a tavern and a liquor store
I play the numbers, yeah, four forty-four
I got a mojo, yeah, don't you know
I'm all dressed up with no place to go

I got women to the right of me
I got women to the left of me
I got women all around me
But I ain't got you
No, I ain't got you

(Third verse)

(Fourth verse)

No I ain't got you

(Cover version of The Yardbirds track performed live by Davy Jones and The Manish Boys).





I Am A Laser

 

I saw him by the DJ
The way he danced was cool
They said that I stood no chance
They called me little fool
Well here I am before ya
And all your friends can see
He'll roast him like a turkey
It's just this flame in me
And no-one can burn like me

I am a laser
Burning through your eyes
And I know what kind of man you are
And I long to hold you tight
I am a laser
Knowing right from wrong
And I know what kind of heart you have
A heart so big and strong

I dreamt how much I lay on ya
Sitting by your side
Driving in my Duesenberg
Going for a ride
I'm going to turn my beam on
If only for an hour
You'll know I've switched the heat on
When you feel my golden shower
And no-one can burn like me

I am a laser
Burning through your eyes
And I know what kind of man you are
And I long to hold you tight
I am a laser
Knowing right from wrong
And I know what kind of heart you have
A heart so big and strong

I know what the boys call me
They think I'm black Barbarella
But only one beam do I have
And that's this heart beat of mine

I am a laser
Burning through your eyes
And I know what kind of man you are
And I long to hold you tight
I am a laser
Knowing right from wrong
And I know what kind of heart you have
A heart so big and strong

(Recorded during the Ava Cherry and The Astronettes sessions at the Olympic Studios, Barnes, London SW13 in November 1974. Evolved into Scream Like A Baby. Original version eventually appears on Ava Cherry and The Astronettes 'People From Bad Homes' in 1995. The track was also recorded during the Young Americans sessions on 13th August 1974 at the Sigma Sound Studios in Philadelphia, USA under the title Lazer but a completely different version).





I Am Divine

 

So you think I'm dressed to impress you
Say I walk a little too tall
I think I may caress you
And show you how I fall
Got my vines(?) at the right time
One step ahead of y'all

I walk a fine line
Pay my price and you'll be mine
'Cos I'm so divine

I'm the mainman in my city
Hey Jim, I'm in control
?????
?????
Don't you want to feel it
Don't you want it all

I walk a fine line
Pay my price and you'll be mine
'Cos I'm so divine

I walk a fine line
Pay my price and you'll be mine
'Cos I'm so divine

(Released on Ava Cherry and The Astronettes 'People From Bad Homes' in 1995).





I Am With Name

(Lyrics: David Bowie. Music: Bowie/Eno/Gabrels/Garson/Kizilcay/Campbell)

(Segue)

I was Ramona A. Stone
I started with no enemies of my own
I was an artiste
In a tunnel
But I've been having a midi-life crisis
And I've been dreaming of sleep
And ape men with metal parts
I've spat upon deeply felt age
I've hid my hearts in
And I hate the funny coloured English
We'll creep together you and I
For I know who the small friends are


(Song)

I am with name, I am with name
I am Ramona A. Stone
A night fear female
Good timing drone
I am with name, I am with name

I am with name, I am with name
I am Ramona A. Stone
And she should say: "twitch and stream"
It'll end in chrome
The night of the female good time drone
I am with name
I am Ramona A. Stone
And she should say
I am with name
I am Ramona A. Stone

A person who loses her name
Feels anxiety descending
Left at the crossroads, between the centuries
A millennium fetish
I am with name, I am with name
I am Ramona A. Stone
I am with name

Night fear female
Good timing drone
I am with name
I am Ramona A. Stone

  (Give it to me one more time!)
Anxiety descending
Anxiety descending




I Can't Explain

(Pete Townsend)

A new feeling inside
It's a certain kind
I feel hot and cold
Down my soul, baby

I can't explain
Going out of my mind
Dizzy in the head, and I'm feeling blue
Things you say well maybe they're true
I get funny dreams again and again
Know what it means, but

Can't explain
I think it's love
Say it to you
When I feel blue

I can't explain, no, I can't explain

You know I can't explain
I'm going out of my mind
Well I'm a worried guy
But I can't explain




I Can't Read

(David Bowie/Reeves Gabrels)

I can't read and I can't write down
I don't know a book from countdown
I don't care which shadow gets me
All I've got is someone's face

Money goes to money heaven
Bodies go to body hell
I just cough and catch the chase
Switch the channel watch the police car

CHORUS
  I can't read shit anymore
  I just sit back and ignore
  'Cos I just can't get it right, can't get it right
  I can't read shit, I can't read shit

When you see a famous smile
No matter where you run your mile
To be right in that photograph
Andy where's my fifteen minutes?

I said - yeah
  I can't read shit anymore
  I just can't read shit anymore
  No matter I, just can't get it right
  I can't read shit, I can't read shit

No!
No!
Oh - oh - oh




I Dig Everything

 

I've got the village tied up
  (Dig everything)
I walk along beside the garbage man 'cos I dig everything
  (Dig everything)
I wave to the policemen, but they don't wave back
They don't dig anything
  (Dig everything)
Ain't had a job for a year or more and I don't own a thing
  (Dig everything)

Everything's fine and I dig everything
Everything's fine and I dig everything
Dig!

I feed the lions in Trafalgar Square and I dig everything
  (Dig everything)
I've sit just behind my window, till my cigarettes were low and dug
Everything
  (Dig everything)
Got a backstreet room in the bad part of town and I dig everything
  (Dig everything)
I'd see people in the street below, who don't know where they're going
They don't dig anything
  (Dig everything)

Everything's fine and I dig everything
Everything's fine and I dig everything
Dig!

I've got more friends than I've had hot dinners
Some of them were losers, but the rest of them are winners
Rick, John, Sally, a connection named Paul
Holy low on money, their intentions are tall
We smoke and talk in my room and we dig everything
Dig!

I've made myself at home
  (Dig everything)
I've made good friends with the time-check girl on the end of the phone
All the movie shows
  (Dig everything)
I sunbathe for love
  (Dig everything)
Even when it's not too hot
  (Dig everything)
'Cos I dig everything
  (Dig everything)
Oh yeah




I Dig Everything (2000 version)

 

Dig everything
Dig everything

I've got the village tied up
I walk along beside the garbage man I dig everything
  (Dig everything)
I wave to the policemen, but they don't wave back
They don't dig anything
  (Dig everything)
I ain't had a job for a year or more and I don't own a thing
  (Don't own a thing)

Everything's fine I dig everything
Everything's fine I dig everything
Yeah!

Feed the lions in Trafalgar Square - I dig everything
I sit just behind my window, till my cigarettes low - I dig everything
Got a backstreet room in the bad part of town - I dig everything
  (Dig everything)
I see people in the street below, don't know where they're going
They don't dig anything
  (Dig anything)

Everything's fine - I dig everything
Everything's fine - I dig everything

I've got more friends than I've had hot dinners
Some of them are losers, the rest of them are winners
Rick, John, Sally, a connection named Paul
Holy low on money, their intentions are tall
We smoke and talk in my room - we dig everything

  (Every)
  (Everything)
  (Every - dig everything)

  (Every)
  (Everything)
  (Every - dig everything)

I've made myself at home
I've made good friends with the time-check girl on the end of the phone
All the movie shows
  (Dig everything)
I sunbathe for love
  (Dig everything)
Even when it's not hot
  (Dig everything)
'Cos I dig everything
  (Dig everything)

Everything's fine - I dig everything
Everything's fine - I dig everything
Yeah!

  (Every)
  (Everything)

I Feel Free

(Jack Bruce/Peter Brown)

Dear when I dance with you
We move like the sea
You, you're all I want to know
I feel free
I feel free

I can walk down the street
There's no one there
The pavement is one huge crowd
I can drive down the road
My eyes can't see
But my mind wants to cry out loud

I can walk down the street
There's no one there
The pavement is one huge crowd
I can drive down the road
My eyes can't see
But my mind wants to cry out loud
My mind wants to cry out loud

I feel free

Dance floor is like the sea
The ceiling is the sky
You're the sun, and as you shine on me
I feel free
I feel free
I feel free




I Feel So Bad

(Chuck Willis)

Feel so bad
Like a ball game on a rainy day
Feel so bad
Like a ball game on a rainy day
Yes' I got my rain check
Shake my head and walk away

Oooo-people that's the way I feel
Oooo-people that's the way I feel
Sometimes I think I want
Then again I think I don't
Sometimes I want to stay here
Then again I want to leave here
Then again I want to stay
Yes, I got my train fare
Pack my grip and ride away

Oooo-people that's the way I feel
Oooo-people that's the way I feel
Sometimes I think I want
Then again I think I don't

(Performed live at the Gorge Ampitheatre, WA, USA on 16th August 2002).





I Got You Babe

(Sonny Bono)

They say we're young and we don't know
We won't find out until we grow
Well I don't know if all that's true
'Cos you got me, and baby I got you

Babe
I got you babe
I got you babe

They say our love won't pay the rent
Before it's earned, our money's always spent
I guess that's so, we don't have a pot
But at least I'm sure of all the things we got

Babe
I got you babe
I got you babe

I got flowers in the spring
I got you to wear my ring
And when I'm sad, you're a clown
And if I get scared, you're always around

Don't let them say your hair's too long
'Cos I don't care, with you I can't go wrong
So put your little hand in mine
There ain't no hill or mountain we can't climb

Babe
I got you babe
I got you babe

I got you to hold my hand
I got you to understand
I got you to walk with me
I got you to talk with me
I got you to kiss goodnight
I got you to hold me tight
I got you, I won't let go
I got you to love me so

I got you babe
I got you babe
I got you babe
I got you babe
I got you babe




I Have Not Been To Oxford Town

(Lyrics: David Bowie. Music David Bowie/Brian Eno)

Baby Grace is the victim
She was fourteen years of age
And the wheels are turning, turning
For the finger points at me (All's well)
But I have not been to Oxford Town (All's well)
No I have not been to Oxford Town

Toll the bell
Pay the private eye
All's well
The twentieth century dies

And the prison priests are decent
My attorney seems sincere
I fear my days are numbered
Lord get me out of here, here
All's well
But I have not been to Oxford Town
All's well
But I have not been to Oxford Town

Toll the bell
Pay the private eye
All's well
The twentieth century dies

This is your shadow on my wall
This is my flesh and blood
This is what I could've been

And the wheels are turning and turning
As this twentieth century dies
If I had not ripped the fabric
If time had not stood still
If I had not met Ramona
If I'd only paid my bill
All's well
I have not been to Oxford Town
All's well
But I have not been to Oxford Town

Toll the bell
Pay the private eye
All's well
The twentieth century dies

This is my bunk with two sheets
This is my food though foul
This is what I could have been

Toll the bell
Pay the private eye
All's well
The twentieth century dies

Toll the bell
Pay the private eye
All's well
The twentieth century dies
All's well
The twentieth century dies
All's well

All's well, all's well
Toll the bell
Pay the private eye
All's well
The twentieth century dies
Toll the bell
Pay the private eye
All's well
The twentieth century dies

(Original working title was Toll The Bell).





I Keep Forgettin'

(Jerry Leiber/Mike Stoller)

I keep forgettin' you don't love me no more
I keep forgettin' you don't want me no more
I keep forgettin' that you told me that you
Didn't want me around any more
But these stupid old feet
Just head for your street
Like they've done so many times before
And this stubborn old fist
On the end of my wrist
Keeps a knocking on your front door

I keep forgettin' you don't love me no more
I keep forgettin' you don't want me no more
I keep forgettin' bout those heartbreaking nights
And those heartbreaking things
That you said
Though I know in my heart
We're drifting apart
I can't believe that our love is dead
Though it's plain as can be
That you're finished with me
I just can't get it through my head




I Know It's Gonna Happen Someday

(Steven Patrick Morrissey / Mark Nevin)

My love wherever you are
Whatever you are, don't lose faith
I know it's gonna happen someday
To you
Please wait
Please wait
Wait, don't lose faith
You say that the day never arrives
And it's never seemed so far away
But I know it's gonna happen someday
To you
Please wait
Please wait
Wait, don't lose faith
Please wait
Please wait
Please, don't lose faith
Don't lose faith

You say that the day never arrives
And it seems so far away
But I know it's gonna happen someday
Someday to you
To you
Please wait




I Lost My Confidence

 

 





I Never Dreamed

(David Jones / Alan Dodds)

I never dreamed
That I'd fall in love with you
I never dreamed
That your eyes could be so blue

Till I looked your way baby
And saw your tender smile
I wanted you so badly
My heart was captured for a while

I never dreamed
Your caress could hurt so much
I never dreamed
That I would shake to your tender touch

Till you held my hand
Run your fingers through my hair
The other guys all laughed at me
But I didn't really care

I never dreamed
I never dreamed
I never dreamed



(Recorded with The Konrads on 29th August 1963 at Decca Recording Studios, Broadhurst Gardens, West Hampstead, London NW6. David performed on backing vocals).

And the song on the wind
Brings nothing back sorrow

I Took A Trip On A Gemini Spaceship

(Norman Carl Odam)

Took a trip on a Gemini spacecraft
And I thought about you
I passed through the shadow of Jupiter
(sigh)
And I thought about you
I shot my spacegun
Boy, really felt blue

Two or three flying saucers
Parked under the stars
Winding scream
Moon shining down
On some little town
And with each beam
The same old dream

I took a trip on a Gemini spacecraft
And I thought about you
Well I shot my spacegun
And I thought about you
Pulled down my sun visor
Boy, I really felt blue

You jumped into your Gemini
Jumped into mine
We'll orbit the Moon
For just one time
Tomorrow night
Tomorrow night
Will you hold hands
With me under the moonlight?

Took a trip in a Gemini spacecraft
And I thought about you
I shot my spacegun
And I thought about you
I took, I took a walk in space
Boy, I, I really felt blue

Well I peeked through the crack
And I looked way back
Stardust trail
Leading back to you
What did I do?
What could I do?
Yes what did I do?
Well
I thought about you
I thought about you
Took a trip on a Gemini spacecraft
Thought about you




I Wanna Be Your Dog

(Iggy Pop)

So messed up, I want you near
In my room I want you here
Now we're gonna be face to face
And I'll lay right down in my favourite place

(Chorus)
  Now I wanna be your dog
  Now I wanna be your dog
  Now I wanna be your dog
  Well, c'mon!

Now I'm ready to close my eyes
Now I'm ready to close my mind
Now I'm ready to feel the hand
To lose my heart in the burnin' sand




I Want My Baby Back

 

I'm working day and night to find me my passage to write
I'm gonna get the next train, going to be right by her side
Ooh-ah Kitty, just you see
Don't put the blame on me, oh no

I want my baby back, oh no
I want my baby back

I tried to phone her, but the cable was broke by a storm
Now I won't see her till tomorrow, when night meets the dawn
Ooh-ah Kitty, just you see
Don't put the blame on me, oh no

I want my baby back, oh no
I want my baby back

I'll buy her anything
A big fat car, a diamond ring
If she will be my girl
I want her back, I need you girl

I'm working day and night to find me my passage to write
I'm gonna get the next train, going to be right by her side
Ooh-ah Kitty, just you see
Don't put the blame on me, oh no

I want my baby back, oh no
I want my baby back, oh no

I Wish You Would

(Billy Arnold)

CHORUS
  Early in the morning by the break of day
  That's when my baby went away
  Come back baby I wish you would
  This crying and grieving won't do me no good

Hugging and a-kissing, late at night
You know pretty baby it feels just right
Come back baby what you're trying to do?
Turning on me and some other man too

Come back baby gimme me one more chance
You know I still love you gonna give you romance
Yeah, romance, all night long
In my arms, oh yeah, oh

CHORUS

Hey pretty baby I love you so
You know pretty baby it hurts me to see you go
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh, yeah (repeat ad inf.)




I Would Be Your Slave

 

Walking in the snowy street
Let me understand
Drifting down a silent path
Stumbling over land
Open up your heart to me
Show me who you are
And I would be your slave

Do you sleep in quietude?
Do you walk in peace?
Do you laugh out loud at me?
But no one else is free
Open up your heart to me
Show me all you are
And I would be your slave

I don't sit and wait
I don't give a damn
I don't see the point at all
No footprints in the sand

I bet you laugh out loud at me
A chance to strike me down
Give me peace of mind at last
Show me all you are
Open up your heart to me
I would be your slave

I don't sit around and wait
I don't give a damn
I don't see the point at all
No footprints in the sand

I would give you all my love
Nothing else is free
Open up your heart to me
And I would be your slave

(Performed live at the Tibet Annual Benefit Show on 22nd February 2002).

(Jerry Leiber/Mike Stoller)

Well I'm a hog for you baby
I can't get enough of your love
I'm a hog for you baby
I can't get enough of your love

I'm Deranged

(Lyrics: David Bowie. Music David Bowie/Brian Eno)

Funny how secrets travel
I'd start to believe if I were to bleed
Thin sky, the man chains his hands held high
The cruise me blond
Cruise me babe
A blond beneath beyond beyond beyond
No return, no return

I'm deranged
Deranged my love
I'm deranged down down down
So cruise me babe cruise me baby

CHORUS
  And the rain sets in
  It's the angel-man
  I'm deranged

Cruise me, cruise me, cruise me babe

The clutch of life and the fist of love
Over your head
Big deal Salaam
Be real deranged Salaam
Before we reel
I'm deranged

CHORUS (twice)

Cruise me, cruise me, cruise me babe

I'm deranged




I'm Getting Back To Me

(??)

 

(Performed live by David Bowie and The Buzz).





I'm Not Losing Sleep

 

Yes, I've read the morning papers
Telling me that you've made money
Do you think I'm gonna crawl, then think again

Though I'm dressed in rags, I'm richer
Though I eat from tins, I'm healthier
Though I live in slums, I'm purer than you, my friend

Too bad, I'm not losing sleep
(Too bad) I'm just counting sheep
(Too bad) I'm not losing sleep, my friend

Look around and see the friends
The ones you left, our friends deserted
See the guys that used to talk and drink with you

Don't look down your nose at me
'Cos I won't ask your sympathy
I won't be your yes-sir man for anything

Too bad, I'm not losing sleep
(Too bad) I'm just counting sheep
(Too bad) I'm not losing sleep, my friend

I would walk with you
Talk with you, drink with you
If you drop that halo that you're wearing on the ground

Too bad, I'm not losing sleep
(Too bad) I'm just counting sheep
(Too bad) I'm not losing sleep, my friend

I can't get my satisfaction
Knowing you won't get reaction
What makes me the big attraction anyway

It's too bad, I'm not losing sleep
(Too bad) I'm just counting sheep
(Too bad) I'm not losing sleep, my friend

Too bad, I'm not losing sleep
(Too bad) I'm just counting sheep
(Too bad) I'm not losing sleep, my friend

Oh, it's too bad, I'm not losing sleep
(Too bad) I'm just counting sheep
(Too bad) I'm not losing sleep, my friend




I'm Not Quite - (demo)

 

The hand that wrote this letter
Sweeps the pillow clean
So rest your head and read a treasured dream
I care for no one else but you
I tear my soul to cease the pain
I think maybe you feel the same
What can we do?
I'm not quite sure what we're supposed to do
So I've been writing just for you

They say your life is going very well
I hear you sparkle like a different girl
But something tells me that you hide
When all the world is warm and tired
You cry a little in the dark
Well so do I
I'm not quite sure what you're supposed to say
But I can see it's not okay

He makes you laugh
He gives ya every chance
He treats you well
And brings you out in style
And when he's strong
He's strong for you
And when you kiss
It's something new
But did you ever call my name
Just by mistake?
I'm not quite sure what I'm supposed to do
So I'll just write some love to you

(Appears on a demo tape recorded by David Bowie and John 'Hutch' Hutchinson in April 1969. The song was later renamed Letter To Hermione).





I'm Pure

 

 




I've Been Waiting For You

(Neil Young)

I've been looking for a woman to save my life
Not to beg or to borrow
A woman with the feeling of losing once or twice
Who knows how it could be, be tomorrow?

I've been waiting for you
And you've been coming to me
For such a long time now
For such a long time now

A woman with the feeling losing once or twice
Who knows how it could be, be tomorrow?

I've been waiting for you
And you've been coming to me
For such a long time now
For such a long time now
For such a long time now
For such a long time now

If I'm Dreaming My Life

(David Bowie/Reeves Gabrels)

VERSE (there)
  Was she never there/here?
  Was she ever?
  Was it air she breathed?

  At the wrong time
  Oh-oh
  Oh-oh

All the flowers so
From the gallery
With the hymns of night
Singing "Come to me"

CHORUS
  At the wrong time
  On the wrong day
  All the lights are fading now
  If I'm dreaming all my life (x2 second time)

Just one living chance
When the mother sighs
When the father steps aside
At the wrong time
Oh-oh

VERSE (here)

CHORUS

Was she ever?
Was she ever here?
If I'm dreaming all my life
If I'm dreaming all my life away

Dreaming my life
Dreaming my
Dreaming my
Dreaming my
Dreaming my life
Dreaming my life away
Oh-oh

REPEAT
  Dreaming my life
  Dreaming my
  Dreaming my life away
  Oh-oh




If There Is Something

(Brian Ferry)

If there is something
That I might find
Look around corners
Try to find peace of mind, I say
"Where would you go
If you were me?
Trying to keep a straight course is not easy"

Somebody special
Looking at me
Same kind of reaction
Wanted to cry with me
If there are many
Too easy to say
When it's love
It's just a game-ame-ame-ame

I would do anything for you
I would come all day
I would swim all the oceans blue
I would walk a thousand miles
Reveal my secrets
More than enough for me to share
I will put roses around your door
Sit in the garden
Growing potatoes by the score

Shake your head girl, with your ponytail
Takes me right back (when you were young)
Throw your precious gifts into the air
Watch them fall down (when you were young)

Your love - could feel you put them on the ground
It used to fall apart (when you were young)

Your love - could feel you put them on the ground
The hills were higher (when you were young)

Your love - could feel you put them on the ground
The trees were taller then (when you were young)

Your love - could feel you put them on the ground
The grass was greener (when you were young)

Your love - could feel you put them on the ground
It use to fall apart (when you were young)




If You Don't Come Back

Imagine

(John Lennon)

Imagine there's no heaven
It's easy if you try
No hell below us
Above us only sky
Imagine all the people
Living for today

Imagine there's no country
It isn't hard to do
Nothing to kill or die for
And no religion too
Imagine all the people
Living life in peace

You may call me a dreamer
But I'm not the only one
I hope someday you'll join us
And the world will be one

Imagine no possessions
I wonder if we can?
No need for greed or hunger
A brotherhood of man
Imagine all the people
Sharing all the world

You may call me a dreamer
But I'm not the only one
I hope someday you'll join us
And we'll live our lives as one

You may call me a dreamer
But I'm not the only one
I hope some day you'll join us

And the world will live as one
And the world will live as one
And the world will live as one
And the world will live as one
And the world will live as one
And the world will live as one
And the world will live as one

In The Heat Of The Morning

 

The blazing sunset in your eyes will tantalise
Every man who looks your way
I watched them sink before your gaze
Senorita sway
Dance with me before their frozen eyes
I'm so much in love
Like a little soldier catching butterflies

CHORUS
  No man loved like I love you
  Wouldn't you like to love me too?
  In the heat of the morning
  In the shadow I'll clip your wings
  And I'll tell you I love you
  In the heat of the morning

I'll tie a knot in rainbow's end, organise the breeze
Light my candle from the sun
I'll give you daylight for a friend
I'll do all of these
I'll prove that it can be done, oh, I'm so much in love
Like the ragged boy who races with the wind

CHORUS

In the heat of the morning
In the shadow I'll clip your wings
And I'll tell you I love you
In the heat of the morning

Oh yeah, all day, all the way

Ooh




In The Heat Of The Morning (2000 version)

  No man loved like I love you
  Wouldn't you like to love me too?
  In the heat of the morning
  In the shadow I'll clip your wings

I'll tie a knot in rainbow's end, organise the breeze

In the shadow I'll clip your wings
And I'll tell you I love you

Isolation

(Iggy Pop/David Bowie)

Needed you
You were only using
Needing you just
Tore me down
Here I stand
In isolation
Feeling emptiness and doubt
Walking down the
Broken highway
Sucking sugar
Plain and sweet
Did your mother
Ever tell you
That the joyful are free

I need some lovin'
Like an inmate needs a dime
I need some lovin'
Like a poet needs a rhyme
Here I stand in isolation
My empty hands - in isolation
Walking down the
Broken highway
Sucking sugar
'Cos it's my way

Find me one heart
To complete with
Heading for the
Farthest beaches
I need some lovin'
Like a body needs a soul
I need some lovin'
Like a fastball needs control
Here I stand in isolation
My empty hands - in isolation
Strike up the band
In this proud land

Got a lot to do
Got a lot to say
Got a life to live
Here I stand -
In isolation

(Performed live by David Bowie and The Buzz).





It's Gonna Be Me

 

Hey Jack I better shake it off. Put her out of my head
Thinking I balled just another young girl last night
Oh brother! I left a woman in that morning bed
Been on that trip so many times
Good God! Was it really yesterday?

I've tried so many, many, many, many, many, many ways
I've lied and taken off into the day
Leaving another girl to weep over the breakfast tray
Loved her before I knew her name, hit me Jack, 'cos I'm
Gonna love her way

CHORUS
  (Come back, my babe)
  Come back, my babe
  Be holy again, I gave her
  (I gave her) Ooh, maybe, maybe
  (Ooh maybe) Gotta give her, ooh baby, baby (Ooh baby)
  That kind of love
  Can only destroy, I gave her
  (I gave her) Ooh maybe, maybe
  (Ooh maybe) Get it down if I'm gonna be her baby, 'cos
  (Ooh baby)
  Gonna be me
  (It's gonna be me)

There was no rein to check me
When all of those little things walked on by
Oh! But I couldn't really stammer out a word
When that angel stuck in my mind
Oooooh, looking for love won't hold me back
(No!) I'm gonna love her way

CHORUS

Just playing that latest record
Waiting for the telephone to ring
Wiped out and bitter with a bag clutched in her hand
All the cars sound like they're pulling in the drive
Hmmm, no, no, no

I see her now
A little tear running down her cheek
Lost, let down
People looking for me
I want to race down her street
And knock hard, hard, hard on the door until
Until she breaks down into my arms like a
Treasured toy and I feel her pain
I'll be so strong, again and again

Come back my baby
I'm hold you again, I'll take you
(I'll take you) Ooh, baby, baby, baby
(Ooh baby) We're gonna have, ooh baby, baby (Ooh baby)
My kind of love
Can only bring you joy, I'm gonna
(I'm gonna) Yeah, baby
(Ooh baby) Yeah, I'll give you baby, baby (Ooh baby)
'Cos it's gonna be me (It's gonna be me)
Hmmmm




It's Gonna Rain Again

 

 


(Recorded during the Ziggy Stardust sessions 1972).





It's Hard To Be A Saint In The City

(Bruce Springsteen)

I had skin like leather and the diamond-hard look of a Cobra
I was born blue and weathered but I burst just like a super-nova
I could walk like Brando right into the sun, and dance just like a Casanova
With my black-jack and jacket and my hair slicked sweet
Silver studs on my duds just like a Harley in heat
When I strut down the street I can hear its heartbeat
The sisters fell back and said "Don't that man look pretty"
The cripple on the corner cried out "Penny, nickels for your pity"
Them gasoline boys down-town, they sure talk gritty
It's so hard to be a saint in the city

I was the king of the alley, mama, I could talk some trash
I was the Prince of the Paupers, crowned down-town at the Beggars' Bash
I was a pimp's main prophet, I kept everything cool
Just a back-street gambler with the luck to lose
And when the heat came down it was left on the ground, mama
Devil appeared to me like Jesus through the steam in the street, and
Showed me a hand that even the cops couldn't beat
An' I felt his hot breath on my neck as I dove into the heat
It's so hard to be a saint when you're just a poor boy out on the street

And the sages of the subway sit just like the living dead
As the tracks clack out the rhythm, the eyes fixed straight ahead
They ride the line of balancing, hold on by just a thread
Well, it's too hot in these tunnels, you can get hit up by the heat
When you get up to get out at your next stop
But they push you right down in your seat
And your heart starts beating faster as you struggle to your feet
Then you're out of that hole, back on the street
And them South-side sisters, they sure look pretty
And the cripple on the corner cries out "Nickels for your pity"
And them down-town boys, they sure talk gritty
It's so hard to be a saint in the... city




It's No Game (Part 1)

(David Bowie. Translation: Hisahi Miura)

1
2
1-2-2

Shirnetto ya kage ga ka ku mei o miteiru
Mo tengoku no giu no kai dan wa nai

Silhouettes and shadows watch the revolution
No more free steps to heaven
It's no game

Ore genjitsu kara shime dasare
Nani ga okkote iru ka wakara nai

Doko ni kyokun wa aruka
Hitobito wa yubi ooraneteiru
Konna dokusaisha ni igashime rareru nowa kanashi

I am barred from the event
I really don't understand the situation
And it's no game

Documentaries on refugees
Couples 'gainst the target
You throw a rock against the road
And it breaks into pieces
Draw the blinds on yesterday, and it's all so much scarier
Put a bullet in my brain, and it makes all the papers

Nammino kiroku eiga
Hioteki o se ni shita koibi to tach
Michi ni ishi o nage reba
Konago na ni kudake
Kimo ni nutao sureba
Kyo hu wa masu
Ore no atama ni tama o buchi kome ba
Shinbun wa kaki tateru

So where's the moral when people have their fingers broken
To be insulted by these fascists it's so degrading
And it's no game

Shut up!   Shut up




It's No Game (Part 2)

 

Silhouettes and shadows watch the revolution
No more free steps to heaven
Just walkie-talkie - heaven or hearth
Just big heads and drums - full speed and pagan
And it's no game

I am barred from the event
I really don't understand the situation
So where's the moral?
People have their fingers broken
To be insulted by these fascists is so degrading
And it's no game

Documentaries on refugees, couples 'gainst the target
Throw a rock against the road, and it breaks into pieces
Draw the blinds on yesterday, and it's all so much scarier
Put a bullet in my brain, and it makes all the papers

And it's no game

Children round the world, put camel shit on the walls
They're making carpets on treadmills, or garbage sorting

And it's no game




It's No Game - (earlier version)

 

Silhouettes and shadows watch the revolution
No more free steps to heaven
Just walkie-talkie - heaven or hearth
Just big heads and drums - full speed and pagan
Well it's no game

I am barred from the events
I really don't understand the situation
So where's the moral?
People have their fingers broken
To be insulted by these fascists is so degrading
It's no game

Documentaries on refugees, couples against the target
Throw a rock upon the road, and it breaks into pieces
Draw the blinds on yesterday, and it's all so much scarier
Put a bullet in my brain, and it makes all the papers

It's no game

Children round the world, put camel shit on the walls
They're making carpets on treadmills, or garbage sorting

And it's no game

It's So Easy

(Buddy Holly/Norman Petty)

Well, you're concerned that my heart as learned
It's so easy to fall in love
It's so easy to fall in love
So here I go breaking all of the rules
It seems so easy, (seems so easy, seems so easy)
Umm-hmm so doggone easy (doggone easy , doggone easy)
Umm-hmm, it seems so easy, (seems so easy, seems so easy, seems so easy)
Well, your concerned that my heart has learned

It's so easy to fall in love
It's so easy to fall in love
It's so easy to fall in love
It's so easy to fall in love

Look into your heart and see
What your love could be set apart for me
It seems so easy, (seems so easy, seems so easy)
Umm-hmm so doggone easy (doggone easy , doggone easy)
Umm-hmm, it seems so easy, (seems so easy, seems so easy, seems so easy)
Well, your concerned that my heart has learned

It's so easy to fall in love
It's so easy to fall in love

Janine - (demo)

 

My love, Janine
I'm helpless for your smile
Like a Polish wanderer
I travel ever onwards to your land
Were it not just for the jewels, I'd close your hand

Your plain demand
To collocate my mind
Scares me into gloom
You're too intense
I'll keep my veil across my face
I've no defence
I've got to keep you in your place

Janine, Janine, you'd like to know me well
But I've got things inside my head
That even I can't face

Janine, Janine, you'd like to crash my walls
But if you take an axe to me
You'll kill another man
Not me at all

You're fey, Janine
A tripper to the last
But if I catch you standing on my toes
I'll have a right to shout you down
You're just a lazy stream
In which my thoughts would drown

So stay, Janine
And we can glide along
I've caught your wings for laughs
I'm not obliged to read your statements of the year
So take your glasses off
And don't act so sincere

Janine, Janine, you'd like to know me well
But I've got things inside my head
That even I can't face

Janine, Janine, you'd like to crash my walls
But if you take an axe to me
You'll kill another man
Not me at all

Nah nah nah nah nah nah, nah nah nah Janine
Nah nah nah nah nah nah, nah nah nah

Janine, Janine, you'd like to know me well
But I've got things inside my head
That even I can't face

Janine, Janine, you'd like to crash my walls
But if you take an axe to me
You'll kill another man
Not me at all

(Appears on a demo tape recorded by David Bowie and John 'Hutch' Hutchinson in April 1969).

Jeepster

(Marc Bolan)

You're so sweet
You're so fine
I want you all and everything
Just to be mine

'Cos you're my babe
'Cos you're my love
Girl I'm just a jeepster
For your love

You slide so good
With bones so fair
You've got the universe
Reclining in your hair

Just like a car
You're pleasing to behold
I'll call you Jaguar
If I may be so bold

The wild winds blow
Upon your frozen cheek
The way you flip your hip
It always makes me weak

Your motivation
Is so sweet
Your vibrations
Are burning up my fee

Girl I'm just a jeepster
For your love
Girl I'm just a vampire
For your love

I'm gonna suck you!

Jewel

(Frank Black/David Bowie/Reeves Gabrels/Mark Plati)


I'm leaving my heart, a boy's heart
I'm leaving it far behind
I'm going for mine, I'm painting my lips
Yeah, I'm getting my shoes shined
I'm leaving my heart, my bleeding heart
My shiny shoes, my rosy cheeks
I cut out my heart, I open the door
I'm so happy without my heart
Now I'm screaming "Oh my jewel" so happily
Without my heart
I am a man and I am cruel, I'm the king of cruelty
I'm the king of cruelty

I believe my face, a girl's face
I believe my face is one of a kind
I point the stars and roll my eyes
They poison my young mind
Believe my face, the charming face
My poison eyes, believe my eyes
I roll up my sleeves, I rock on my heels
But I'm nothing without my face
And now I'm screaming "Oh my jewel" so happily
I'm lonely without my face
I am a man and I am cruel, I'm the king of cruelty
I'm nothing without my face
But now I'm screaming "Oh my jewel" so happily
I am a man and I am cruel, I'm the king of cruelty
I'm the king of cruelty
I'm the king of cruelty

And now I'm screaming "Oh my jewel" so happily
I am a man and I am cruel, I'm the king of cruelty
And now I'm screaming "Oh my jewel" so happily
I am a man and I am cruel, I'm the king of cruelty
And now I'm screaming "Oh my jewel" so happily

I am a man and I am cruel, I'm the king of cruelty
And now I'm screaming "Oh my jewel" so happily
I am a man and I am cruel, I'm the king of cruelty
And now I'm screaming "Oh my jewel" so happily
I am a man and I am cruel, I'm the king of cruelty
Now I'm screaming
I am a man, I am
Now I'm screaming - LA! LA!
Now I'm screaming





Joe The Lion

 

Joe the lion
Went to the bar
A couple of drinks on the house and he said
"Tell you who you are if you nail me to my car"

Boy
Thanks for hesitating
This is the kiss off

Boy
Thanks for hesitating
You'll never know the real story
Just a couple of dreams
You get up and sleep

You can buy God
It's Monday
You slither down the greasy pipe
So far so good no one saw you
Hobble over any freeway
You will be like your dreams tonight

You get up and sleep
You get up and sleep
Joe the lion
Made of iron

Joe the lion
Went to the bar
A couple of drinks on the house an' he was
A fortune teller he said
"Nail me to my car and I'll tell you who you are"

Joe the lion, yeah yeah
Went to the bar, yeah yeah
A couple of dreams and he was
A fortune teller he said
"Nail me to my car, tell you who you are"

You get up and sleep
The wind blows on your check
The day laughs in your face
Guess you'll buy a gun
You'll buy it secondhand
An' you'll get up and sleep

Joe the lion made of iron (repeat ad inf.)

Join The Gang

 

Let me introduce you to the gang
Johnny plays the sitar, he's an existentialist
Once he had a name, now he plays our game
You won't feel so good now that you've joined the gang

Molly is the model in the ads
Crazy clothes and acid full of soul and crazy hip
Someone switched her on, then her beam went wrong
'Cos she can't switch off now that she's joined the gang

Arthur is a singer with a band
Arthur drinks two bottles just before he goes on stage
Look at Arthur rave, all the kids are paid
They want to see the croaking man who joined the gang

You won't be alone, we've all got beery grins
It's a big illusion but at least you're in
At least you're in

This club's called The Webb, it's this month's pick
Next month we shall find a place where prices aren't so stiff
15 bob a Coke, 'fraid that's past a joke
This is how to spend now that you've joined the gang

This is what to do now that you're here
Sit round doing nothing all together very fast
Psychedelic stars, throwing down cigars
They're picking up the joints now that they've joined the gang




Julie

 

Julie
Oh
And I know

Like a mirror, Sunday morning
When the dark clouds hung above
I saw you kneeling 'neath a garden
I saw the grim and stood above

What kind of meaning in a gun shot
It doesn't matter what they say
I never felt I aimed at no one
And who's gonna take the gun away

Julie
Pretend for me
That I'm someone in your life

Julie
I'm yours till the end
All the days and memories

I'm not a man of single reason
It's in every single man
This beat of jealous retribution
And every spurned heart makes its plan

Well, I know that you really loved him
And I know that if there's a God above
Through million times we'll remember
How the trail slips away

Julie
Pretend for me
Even only for a while

Julie
My soul is on the line
All the days and memories

Julie
Remember me
All the days of your life

Julie
I'm lost over you
Passion always ends this way
End this way




Jump They Say

 

When comes the shaking man
A nation in his eyes
Striped with blood and emblazed tattoo
Streaking cathedral spire

They say
  'He has no brain'
They say
  'He has no mood'
They say
  'He was born again'
They say
  'Look at him climb'
They say "Jump"

They say
  'He has two Gods'
They say
  'He has no fear'
They say
  'He has no eyes'
They say
  'He has no mouth'

They say 'hey that's really something'
They feel he should get some time
I say he should watch his ass
My friend don't listen to the crowd
They say "Jump"

Got to believe somebody

Karma Man

 

Fingertip sunlit sideshow stalls, they throw the balls
At coconut fur that hides behind coloured shades that blind your eyes
Every child's mother holds an ice-cream cone, they circle round
Perceived unknown by an eye that peers from a hole in the tent where no one goes
A figure sitting cross-legged on the floor
He's cloaked and clothed in saffron robes
His beads are all he owns

Slow down, slow down
Someone must have said that slowed him down
Slow down, slow down
It's pictured on the arms of the Karma Man

Fairy tale skin, depicting scenes from human zoos
Impermanent toys like peace and war
A gentle face you've seen before
Karma Man tattooed on your side, the wheel of life
I see my times and who I've been
I only live now and I don't know why
I struggle hard to take these pictures in, but
All my friends can see is just the pinkness of his skin

Slow down, slow down
Someone must have said that slowed him down
Slow down, slow down
It's pictured on the arms of the Karma Man

Slow down, slow down
Someone must have said that slowed him down
Slow down, slow down
It's pictured on the arms of the Karma Man




Kingdom Come

(Tom Verlaine)

Well I walked in the pouring rain
And I heard a voice that cries "It's all in vain"
The voice of doom was shining in my room
I just need one day somewhere far away
Lord I just need one day

Well I'll be breaking these rocks
And cutting this hay
Yes I'll be breaking these rocks
What's my price to pay?

Well the river's so muddy, but it may come clear
And I know too well what's keeping me here
I'm just the slave of a burning ray
Oh give me the night, I can't take another sight
Please, please give me the night

CHORUS

Sun keeps beating down on me, wall's a mile high
Up in the tower they're watching me hoping I'm gonna die

I won't be breaking no rocks
I said "I won't be breaking no rocks"

(I won't be breaking no rocks) Oh-oh-oh
(I won't be breaking no rocks) Oh-oh-oh
(I won't be breaking no rocks)
When the kingdom comes (repeat ad inf.)




Kingdom Come - (earlier version)

(Tom Verlaine)

Well I walk in the pouring rain
And I heard a voice that cries "It's all in vain"
It was a voice of doom shining in my room
I just need one day, somewhere far away
Lord I just need one day

'Cos it's breaking these rocks
And cutting this hay
Yes I've been breaking these rocks
It was my price to pay

Well the river's so muddy, but it may come clear
And I know too well yeah what's keeping me here
Oh yeah I'm just a slave of a burning rays
And give the night, I can't take another sight
Please please give me the night

'Cos I've been breaking these rocks
And cutting this hay
Yes I've been breaking these rocks
It was my price to pay

Sun keeps beating down on me, the wall's a mile high
Up in the tower they're watching me, hoping hoping I'm gonna gonna gonna die

Yeah I've been over these hills
I won't be breaking no rocks
I see over these hills
I won't be breaking no rocks
And my hope that those ???
Well pardon me
I won't be breaking no rocks (3 times)
When the kingdom comes (3 times)
I won't be breaking no rocks (2 times)

(From demo sessions recorded in 1980 for the Scary Monsters (And Super Creeps) album).





Knock On Wood

(Eddie Floyd/Steve Cropper)

I don't wanna lose the good thing that I've got
If I have do, I will surely, I will lose a lot

For your love is better than any love other I've known
It's like thunder, lightning
The way you love me is frightening
I better knock on wood
Baby

I got superstitious about you, but I can't take a change
You got me spinning, baby, spinning in a trance
But your love is better than any other love I've known
It's like thunder, lightning
The way you love me is frightening
You better knock on wood

Yeah

It's no secret, but that woman fills my lovin' cup
She sees to it, that I get enough
And her love is better than any other love I've known
It's like thunder
It's like lightning, yeah
The way you love me is frightening
I better knock on wood
Baby
Ahh yeah
(Yes you better knock, knock, knock on wood) I better knock
(Yes you better knock, knock, knock on wood) Oh, knock on wood
(Yes you better knock, knock, knock on wood) You know I would, yeah, alright
(Yes you better knock, knock, knock on wood) It's no secret
(Yes you better knock, knock, knock on wood) No, oh, better
(Yes you better knock, knock, knock on wood) Than I've known
(Yes you better knock, knock, knock on wood) I can't leave her alone
(Yes you better knock, knock, knock on wood) Oh no, baby
Knock on wood, woo!




Kooks

 

Will you stay in our lovers' story
If you stay you won't be sorry
'Cos we believe in you
Soon you'll grow so take a chance
With a couple of Kooks
Hung up on romancing

Will you stay in our lovers' story
If you stay you won't be sorry
'Cos we believe in you
Soon you'll grow so take a chance
With a couple of Kooks
Hung up on romancing

We bought a lot of things to keep you warm and dry
And a funny old crib on which the paint won't dry
I bought you a pair of shoes
A trumpet you can blow
And a book of rules
And what to say to people when they pick on you
'Cos if you stay with us you're gonna be pretty kooky too

Will you stay in my lovers' story
If you stay you won't be sorry
'Cos we believe in you
Soon you'll grow so take a chance
With a couple of Kooks
Hung up on romancing

And if you ever have to go to school
Remember how they messed up this old fool
Don't pick fights with the bullies or the cads
'Cos I'm not much cop at punching other people's Dads
And if the homework brings you down
Then we'll throw it on the fire
And take the car down town

Will you stay in our lovers' story
If you stay you won't be sorry
'Cos we believe in you
Soon you'll grow so take a chance
With a couple of Kooks
Hung up on romancing

(repeat chorus ad inf.)




Lady Grinning Soul

 

She'll come, she'll go
She'll lay belief on you
Skin sweet with musky oil
The lady from another grinning soul

Cologne she'll wear, Silver and Americard
She'll drive a Beetle car
And beat you down at cool Canasta

And when the clothes are strewn, don't be afraid of the room
Touch the fullness of her breast
Feel the love of her caress
She will be your living end

She'll come, she'll go
She'll lay belief on you
But she won't stake her life on you
How can life become her point of view?

And when the clothes are strewn, don't be afraid of the room
Touch the fullness of her breast
Feel the love of her caress
She will be your living end (repeat x5)




Lady Stardust (demo)

 

People stared at the make-up on his face
Laughed at his long black hair, his animal grace
The boy in the bright blue jeans
Jumped up on the stage
And Lady Stardust sang her songs
Of darkness and dismay

CHORUS
  And he was alright, the band was altogether
  And he was alright, his song went on forever
  And he was awful nice
  Really quite out of sight
  And he sang all night long

The femme fatales emerged from shadows
To watch this creature fair
Boys stood upon their chairs
To make their point of view
And I smiled sadly for a love I could not obey
And Lady Stardust sang his songs
Of darkness and dismay

CHORUS
  And he was alright, the band was altogether
  And he was alright, his song went on forever
  And he was awful nice
  Really quite out of sight
  And he sang, all night long

Oh how I lied when they asked if I knew his name

CHORUS
  For he was alright, the band was altogether
  And he was alright, his song went on forever
  And he was awful nice
  Really quite paradise
  And he sang all night long

La la la la (etc)




Lady Stardust

 

People stared at the make-up on his face
Laughed at his long black hair, his animal grace
The boy in the bright blue jeans
Jumped up on the stage
Lady Stardust sang her songs
Of darkness and disgrace

CHORUS
  And he was alright, the band was altogether
  Yes he was alright, the song went on forever
  Yes he was awful nice
  Really quite out of sight
  And he sang all night long

Femme fatales emerged from shadows
To watch this creature fair
Boys stood upon their chairs
To make their point of view
I smiled sadly for a love I could not obey
Lady Stardust sang his songs
Of darkness and dismay

CHORUS
  And he was alright, the band was altogether
  Yes he was alright, his song went on forever
  And he was, awful nice
  Really quite paradise
  And he sang, all night, all night long

Ohh how I sighed when they asked if I knew his name

CHORUS

  Yes he was alright, and their song went on forever
  He was, awful nice
  Really quite paradise
  He sang, all night long

Just watch me do it
Ah help me

Ah help me

Law (Earthlings On Fire)

(Lyrics: David Bowie. Music: David Bowie/Reeves Gabrels)

I don't want knowledge
I want certainty (x3)

On the street
A man shouts out loud
A wallet drops
And money flies into the midday sun

With the sound, with the sound, with the sound of the ground (x3)
Sure I get a little bit afraid
Sometimes

Earthlings on fire (x2)

CHORUS
  With the sound, with the sound, with the sound of the ground (x3)
  Sure I get a little bit afraid

Sometimes

Earthlings on fire (x4)

I don't want knowledge, I want certainty (x2)

In a room a man drops dead
As he hits the floor he sighs
"What a morning"

CHORUS (x2)

Sometimes

Earthlings on fire (repeat to last verse as backing vocals)

Sure I get a little bit afraid
Sometimes

I don't want knowledge, I want certainty (x2)
Oh I get a little bit afraid
Sometimes

I don't want knowledge, I want certainty (x2)
I don't want knowledge




Lazer

 

Let's hear it for the gouster (yeah)
Baggy pants and a watch chain
Dressed down like the spirit and his game
But mirror, mirror on the wall sees all
But your doo-wop rag made you look tough
Razor blades in her bra
Mirror, mirror on the wall

I am the laser
Burning through your eyes
And I know what kind of flame you have
I know what fear you hide

Hear it for the T-shirt
Oh those crew cuts that hurt
Clicking jigaboo so Lenny Bruce
Mirror, mirror on the wall sees all
Dog tooth or paisley?
Processed or strained?
But mirror, mirror on the wall says

I am the laser
Burning through your lies
You'll join my other world some day
Then gaze in through outside

I am the laser
Burning through your lies
You'll join my other world some day
You'll gaze in through outside

Oh yeah!

(Recorded during the Young Americans sessions on 13th August 1974 at the Sigma Sound Studios in Philadelphia, USA).

Let Me Sleep Beside You

 

Baby, baby, brush the dust of youth from off your shoulder
Because the years of threading daisies lie behind you now
Don't return to fields of green where rainbow secrets were told
Place your ragged doll with all the toys and things and deeds
I will show you game where the winner never wins

CHORUS
  Let your hair hang down, wear the dress your mother wore
  Let me sleep beside you

Lock away your childhood and throw away the key
For now the streets and city sounds will burn your eyes as coals
We shall drink the oldest wine and velvet skies will linger
Child, you're a woman now, your heart and soul are free
I will hold a lighted lamp and we shall walk together

CHORUS

Your darkened eyes throw mystery
But your lips are void of history
You could not imagine that it could happen this way, could you?
I will give you dreams and I'll tell you things you'd like to hear

CHORUS

Let me sleep beside you




Let Me Sleep Beside You (2000 version)

 

Baby, baby, brush the dust of youth from off your shoulder
Because the years of threading daisies lie behind you
Don't return to fields of green where rainbow secrets were told
Place your ragged doll with all the toys and things and deeds
Even I will show you game where the winner never wins

CHORUS
  Let your hair hang down, wear the dress your mother wore
  Let me sleep beside you

Lock away your childhood and throw away the key
Now the streets and city sights will burn your eyes as coals
We shall drink the oldest wine and velvet skies will linger
Child, you're a woman now, your heart and soul are free (yeah)
I will hold a lighted lamp but we shall walk together

CHORUS
  Let your hair hang down, wear the dress your mother wore
  Let me sleep beside you

Your darkened eyes throw mystery
But your lips are void of history
You could not imagine that it could happen this way, could you?

I will give you dreams and I'll tell you things you'd like to hear

CHORUS
  Let your hair hang down, wear the dress your mother wore
  Let me sleep beside you
  I said let your hair hang down, wear the dress your mother wore
  Let me sleep beside you

(Re-recorded version for the planned March 2001 unreleased album Toy).

Let's dance

Let's dance
Let's dance

Let's dance    Put on your red shoes and dance the blues
Let's dance    To the song they're playing on the radio

Let's sway    While colour lights up your face
Let's sway    Sway through the crowd to an empty space

If you say run, I'll run with you
If you say hide, we'll hide
Because my love for you
Would tear my heart in two
If you should fall
Into my arms
And tremble like a flower

Let's dance
Let's dance    For fear your grace should fall
Let's dance    For fear tonight is all

If you say run, I'll run with you
If you say hide, we'll hide
Because my love for you
Would tear my heart in two
If you should fall
Into my arms
And tremble like a flower

Let's dance
Let's dance    Knew you could look so fine
Let's dance    You could look into my eyes

(Jim Lee)

(One, two)
(One, two, three, four)

Hey baby won't you take a chance?
Say that you'll let me have this dance

Well let's dance, well let's dance
We'll do the twist, the stomp, the mashed potato too
Any old dance that you wanna do
But let's dance, well let's dance

Hey baby, yeah, you thrill me so
Hold me tight, don't you let me go

But let's dance, well let's dance
We'll do the twist, the stomp, the mashed potato too
Any old dance that you wanna do
But let's dance, well let's dance

Hey, baby, if you're all alone
Maybe you'll let me walk you home

But let's dance, well let's dance
We'll do the twist, the stomp, the mashed potato too
Any old dance that you wanna do
But let's dance, well let's dance

Hey, baby, things are swingin' right
Yes, I know that this is the night

Well let's dance, well let's dance
We'll do the twist, the stomp, the mashed potato too
Any old dance that you wanna do
But let's dance, well let's dance

But let's dance
But let's dance
But let's dance

Let's Spend The Night Together

(Mick Jagger/Keith Richard)

Well, don't you worry 'bout what's been on my mind
I'm in no hurry I can take my time
I'm going red and my tongue's getting tired
Out of my head and my mouth's getting dry
I'm h-h-h-high

CHORUS
  Let's spend the night together
  Now I need you more than ever
  Let's spend the night together now

I feel so strong that I can't disguise, oh my
Well, I just can't apologise, no
Don't hang me up but don't let me down
We could have fun just by fooling around, and around and around

CHORUS

Oh
You know I'm smiling baby
You need some guiding baby
I'm just deciding baby

CHORUS

This doesn't happen to me every day
No excuses I've got anyway, hey
I'll satisfy your every need
And I'll know you'll satisfy me, oh my-my-my my-my

(Three times):
  Let's spend the night together
  Now I need you more than ever

Let's spend the night together
(Spoken):
They said we were too young
Our kind of love was no fun
But our love comes from above
Do it!
Let's make love
Whoo!

CHORUS

Letter To Hermione

 

The hand that wrote this letter
Sweeps the pillow clean
So rest your head and read a treasured dream
I care for no one else but you
I tear my soul to cease the pain
I think maybe you feel the same
What can we do?
I'm not quite sure what we're supposed to do
So I've been writing just for you

They say your life is going very well
They say you sparkle like a different girl
But something tells me that you hide
When all the world is warm and tired
You cry a little in the dark
Well so do I
I'm not quite sure what you're supposed to say
But I can see it's not okay

He makes you laugh
He brings you out in style
He treats you well
And makes you up real fine
And when he's strong
He's strong for you
And when you kiss
It's something new
But did you ever call my name
Just by mistake?
I'm not quite sure what I'm supposed to do
So I'll just write some love to you




Liebe Dich Bis Dienstag

(David Bowie. Translation: Lisa Busch)

Schau aus Deinem Fenster
Schau wer draussen sitzt
Ich bin still hier wartend
Schon die ganze Nacht
Wenn Du dann Dein Haus verlaesst
Klingle ich und rufe
Ah, mein kleines Maedchen
Mein brennend Verlangen erwarchte Sonntag
Gib mir Dein Herz und ich liebe dich bis Dienstag

Who's that hiding in the apple tree
Clinging to a branch?
Don't be afraid, it's only me
Hoping for a little romance
If you lie beneath my shade
I'll keep you nice and cool

Ah, beautiful baby
I was very lonely till I met you on Sunday
My passion's never ending
And I'll love you till Tuesday

Let the wind blow through your hair
Be nice to the big blue sea
Don't be afraid of the man in the moon
Because it's only me
I shall always want you until my love runs dry

Ah, beautiful baby
My heart's aflame
I'll love you till Tuesday
My head's in a whirl
And I'll love you till Tuesday

Liebe, liebe, liebe, liebe
Liebe Dich bis Dienstag
Liebe, liebe, liebe, liebe
Liebe Dich bis Dienstag

Spoken:  Na ja, vielleicht wirds ja auch Mittwoch?

(German version of Love You Till Tuesday recorded at Trident Studios, Soho, London on 29th January 1969, to be used for an appearance on German television. Part German-English lyrics).




Life Is A Circus - (demo)

(Roger Bunn)

CHORUS
  Life is a circus
  It's not fair
  Life is a hard road
  When you're not there
  At the fair

Friends come to see me
  (and the ...) (point where shall I go)
To see the show
  (to help my friend and foe)
  (all that ..)
When will they realise
  (To laugh and drag my name on the ground)
The circus must go

  (Looking at the strengths of every)

???
Papa he talks to me
Don't try your heart
Gets deep inside you
Does you real harm
Don't you care?

Life ??

Stand straight and tall

  (Why let them fight) (Don't lose you balance) (Oh let them fight)
Fight your

Life On Mars?

 

It's a God-awful small affair
To the girl with the mousy hair
But her mummy is yelling "No"
And her daddy has told her to go
But her friend is nowhere to be seen
Now she walks through her sunken dream
To the seat with the clearest view
And she's hooked to the silver screen
But the film is a saddening bore
For she's lived it ten times or more
She could spit in the eyes of fools
As they ask her to focus on

Sailors fighting in the dance hall
Oh man! Look at those cavemen go
It's the freakiest show
Take a look at the Lawman
Beating up the wrong guy
Oh man! Wonder if he'll ever know
He's in the best selling show
Is there life on Mars?

It's on Amerika's tortured brow
That Mickey Mouse has grown up a cow
An' now the workers have struck for fame
'Cos Lennon's on sale again
See the mice in their million hordes
From Ibiza to the Norfolk Broads
Rule Britannia is out of bounds
To my Mother, my dog, and clowns
But the film is a saddening bore
'Cos I wrote it ten times or more
It's about to be writ again
As I ask you to focus on

Sailors fighting in the dance hall
Oh man! Look at those cavemen go
It's the freakiest show
Take a look at the Lawman
Beating up the wrong guy
Oh man! Wonder if he'll ever know
He's in the best selling show
Is there life on Mars?
(Telephone rings: "I think that's the one". "Okay").




Lightning Frightening

 

I'll give you back my farm and I'll give you back my house
I'll give you back my right to be free
I've got moon, I've got sun
Lightning, lightning, lightning
I've got me, I've got you
Frightening, frightening, frightening

I'll give you back my farm and I'll give you back my house
I'll give you back my right to be free
I'll give you back my farm and I'll give you back my house
I'll give you back my right to be free
I've got moon, I've got sun
(I've got) Lightning, lightning, lightning
I've got me, I've got you
(It's) Frightening, frightening, frightening




Like A Rolling Stone

(Bob Dylan)

Yeah
How does it feel?
How does it feel?

Once upon a time you dressed so fine
Threw the bums a dime in your prime, didn't you
People called, say "Beware doll, you're bound to fall"
Thought they were all kidding you
You used to laugh about
Everybody that was hanging out
Now you don't talk so loud
Now you don't seem so proud
About having to be scrounging for your next meal

How does it feel?
How does it feel?
To be without a home
Like a complete unknown
Just like a rolling stone

You've gone to the finest school, Miss Lonely
But you know you only used to get juiced in it
No one ever taught you how to live on the street
You're gonna have to get used to it
You said you'd never compromise
With the mystery tramp, but now you realize
He's not selling any alibi's
As you stare into the vacuum of his eyes
And you ask him if you want to make a deal

How does it feel?
How does it feel?
To be on your own
Like a complete unknown
Just like a rolling stone

Tell me
Tell me
Tell me
Yeah

"Oh, rock Ronno, rock"

You never turned around to catch the frowns on the jugglers and clowns
When they all did their tricks for you
You never understood that it ain't no good
To let other people get your kicks for you
You used to ride a chrome horse with your diplomat
Who carried on his shoulder a Siamese cat
Ain't it hard to discover that
He really wasn't where it's at
After he took from you everything he could steal

How does it feel?
How does it feel?
To be on your own
Like a complete unknown
To be without a home
Just like a rolling stone
Just like a rolling stone
Just like a rolling stone




Little Bombardier

 

War made him a soldier
Little Frankie Mair
Peace left him a loser
The little bombardier

Lines of worry appeared with age
Unskilled hands that knew no trade
Spent his time in the picture house
The little bombardier

Frankie drank his money
The little that he made
Told his woes to no man
Friendless, lonely days

Then one day, in the ABC
Four bright eyes gazed longingly
At the ice-cream in the hand of the little bombardier

Sunshine entered our Frankie's days
Gone his worries, his hopeless maze
His life was fun and his heart was full of joy

Two young children had changed his aims
He gave them toffees and played their games
He bought them presents with every coin he made

Then two gentlemen called on him
Asked him for his name
Why was he friends with the children
Were they just a game?

Leave them alone or we'll get sore
We've had blokes like you in the station before
The hand of authority said "no more" to
The little bombardier

Packed his bags, his heart in pain
Wiped a tear and caught a train
Not to be seen in the town again
The little bombardier




Little Egypt

(Jerry Leiber/Mike Stoller)

I went and bought myself a ticket and I sat down in the very first row
They pulled the curtain but then when they turned the spotlight way down low
Little Egypt came out a-struttin' wearin' nothin' but a button and a bow
Singing, ying-ying, ying-ying, ying-ying, ying-ying

She had a ruby on her tummy and a diamond big as Texas on her toe
She let her hair down and she did the hoochie-coochie real slow
When she did her special number on the zebra skin 
I thought she'd stop the show
Singing, ying-ying, ying-ying, ying-ying, ying-ying

She did her triple somersault and when she hit the ground
She winked at the audience and then she turned around
She had a picture of a cowboy tattooed on her spine
Said, Phoenix, Arizona 1949

Yeah, let me tell you people 
Little Egypt doesn't dance there anymore
She's too busy mopping and a-takin' care of shopping at the store
'Cos we've got seven kids and all day long they crawl around the floor
Singing ying-ying, ying-ying, ying-ying, ying-ying

(Cover version of The Coasters hit song performed live by Davy Jones and The Manish Boys).





Little Miss Emperor

(Iggy Pop/David Bowie)

You're not giving an inch
You're not strung like wire
Your open arms they flinch
Joan Crawford style
Treated like a towel
Inside you howl

On some dark concrete
Midnight street
You've built an altar
That's quite complete
Your self control
Is damned amazing
You're trying hard
And I want you
Little Miss Emperor

You really want to grow
And you're alert, I know
But babies mostly drown
It's a company town
Cheat Gods and joke
Attack your noble ghost

I saw the best minds
Of my generation
Learn how to crawl
Across our nation
Conformity falls
Like one wet blanket
Look how we live
And I want you
Little Miss Emperor
Little Miss Emperor
Trying to open doors




Little Toy Soldier

 

Once upon a time there was a toy soldier
And he lived in the playroom
Once upon a time there was a toy soldier
With a whiplash in his hand

And every night little girl Sadie would take all her clothes off
And wind up the toy solider
And he'd raise his whip and say to her

CHORUS
  "On your knees, little Sadie
  Little Sadie on your knees
  Taste the whip and love not given lightly
  Taste the whip and bleed for me"

Little Sadie loved her little toy soldier
And she'd run home from school each day
Little Sadie loved her little toy soldier
And she'd lock the door so she could play

Little Sadie got ambitious and
Wound the clockwork soldier tighter
So he could whip her harder and harder

CHORUS

One day, Sadie wound and wound
And wound and wound
And wound and wound
Till suddenly
The little toy soldier's spring went
  Woo-woo-woo-woo-woo
  Arrgghhhh!

And he beat her to death!

(Recorded with The Riot Squad at the Decca Studios in April 1969. Sessions produced by Gus Dudgeon).





Little Wonder

(Lyrics: David Bowie. Music: David Bowie/Reeves Gabrels/Mark Plati)

Stinky weather fat
Shaky hand
Dopey morning Doc
Grumpy gnomes

Little wonder then

Little wonder you

Big screen dolls
Tits and explosions
Sleepy time
Bashful but nude

Little wonder then
Little wonder
You little wonder
Little wonder you

I'll get that

Enter galactic
See me to be you
It's all in the tablets
Sneezy Bhutan

Little wonder then
Little wonder
You little wonder
Little wonder you

Sit on my karma
Dame meditation
Take me away

Little wonder then
Little wonder
You little wonder
Little wonder you

  Little wonder
  You little wonder you

CHORUS

You little wonder, little wonder you
Little wonder then, little wonder
You little wonder, little wonder you

London Bye, Ta-Ta

 

CHORUS
  London bye, ta-ta
  Strange young town
  London bye, ta-ta
  Brought me down
  Don't like your new face
  That's not nice
  Got to go far far
  London bye, ta-ta

Gigi, Gigi
Take me away
Gigi, Gigi
Take me today
The boys in the clothes shop
Sold me curry for a pound
His cardboard face is soggy
And he's selling thorny crowns

I loved her!
I loved her!
I've got to get away now
But I loved her!

CHORUS

Red light, green light
Make up your mind
Red light, green light
You're far too unkind
She loves to love all beauty
And she says the norm is funny
But she whimpers in the morning
When she finds she has no money

I loved her!
I loved her!
I've got to get away now
But I loved her!
Ahhh!

CHORUS

CHORUS

Oh, London bye, ta-ta
Oh, London bye, ta-ta
Oh, ehh




Lonely Boy, Lonely Girl

(Lyrics: Ivan Mogul. Music: David Bowie)

(English translation of Ragazzo Solo, Ragazza Sola)

My thoughts have blown in the wind
One thought, just one
I walk while the city sleeps
Her eyes in the night
White neon in the night
A voice, who's could it be?
Tell me lonely boy, where are you going?

Why is there so much pain?
You have lost, without a doubt, a great love
But the city is full of love
No lonely girl, no no no
This time you're in the wrong
No I have not lost everything with her
The colours of life, the blue skies
I will never find anyone like her again
Well, lonely boy, where are you going?

The night is a big sea
If you need my hand to swim
Thank you, but tonight I want to die
Because you know in my eyes
Is an angel, an angel
That will no longer fly
She is there, the colours of life, the blue skies
I will never find anyone like her again

Love You Till Tuesday

 

Just look through your window, look who sits outside
Little me is waiting, standing through the night
When you walk out through your door I'll wave my flag and shout

Ohh, beautiful baby
My burning desire started on Sunday
Give me your heart and I'll love you till Tuesday

Da da da dum (x4)

Who's that hiding in the apple tree, clinging to a branch
Don't be afraid it's only me, hoping for a little romance
If you lie beneath my shade, I'll keep you nice and cool

Ohh, beautiful baby
I was very lonely till I met you on Sunday
My passion's never-ending and I'll love you till Tuesday

Da da da dum (x7)

Let the wind blow through your hair, be nice to the big blue sea
Don't be afraid of the man in the moon, because it's only me
I shall always watch you until my love runs dry

Ohh, beautiful baby
My heart's aflame, I'll love you till Tuesday
My head's in a whirl and I'll love you till Tuesday
Love, love, love, love you till Tuesday
Love, love, love, love you till Tuesday

Da da da dum (x11)

Well, I might stretch it till Wednesday




Love You Till Tuesday (Demo)

My passion's never-ending and I'll love you till Tuesday

My head's in a whirl and I'll love you till Tuesday

Loving The Alien

 

Watching them come and go
The Templars and the Saracens
They're travelling the Holy Land
Opening telegrams (oh oh)

Torture comes and torture goes
Knights who'd give you anything
They bear the cross of Coeuf de Leon
Salvation for the mirror blind (woah oh)

But if you pray all your sins are hooked upon the sky
Pray and the heathen lie will disappear
Prayers they hide the saddest view
  (Believing the strangest things, loving the alien)
And your prayers they break the sky in two
  (Believing the strangest things, loving the alien)
You pray till the break of dawn
  (Believing the strangest things, loving the alien)
And you'll believe you're loving the alien
  (Believing the strangest things, loving the alien)

Thinking of a different time
Palestine a modern problem
Bounty and your wealth in land
Terror in a best laid plan (woah oh)

Watching them come and go
Tomorrows and the yesterday's
Christians and the unbelievers
Hanging by the cross and nail (woah oh)




Lucy Can't Dance

 

Lucy I know what you're going to going to do
Oh Lucy look what you're doing I'm doing it too
Now you're looking for God in exciting new ways
I say trust him at once which is something these days

Lucy can't dance to the noise but she knows what the noise can do
Lucy can't dance to the noise but she knows what the noise can do

Did the world just explode?
Don't recognise anyone
But you've still got me under your thumb

Lucy can't dance to the noise but she knows what the noise can do

There's tooling your frenzy in the Tole Savoy
And the sexual noise which is caught up a toy
You live and you die in the blink of an eye
Well I can't make you dance
Dance to the noise

Lucy can't dance but she knows what the noise can do
Dance to the noise
Lucy can't dance but she knows what the noise can do

Lucy I know what you're going to going to do
But you can't buy me off in the sterile world
Who who who died and made you material girl?

Lucy can't dance to the noise but she knows what the noise can do

So I'll spin while my lunatic lyric goes wrong
Guess I'll put all my eggs in a post modern song

Lucy can't dance to the noise but she knows what the noise can do

Oh this fellow are mocked by reality
Just a few simple words like I love you, I need you
Live and you die in the blink of an eye
Still I can't make you dance
Dance to the noise

Lucy can't dance but she knows what the noise can do




Lust For Life

(Lyrics: Iggy Pop. Music: David Bowie)

Here comes Johnny Yen again
With the liquor and drugs
And the flesh machine
He's gonna do another striptease
Hey man where'd you get
That lotion? I been hurting
Since I bought the gimmick
About something called love
Yeah something called love
That's like hypnotizing chickens
Well I am just a modern guy
Of course I've had it in the ear before
'Cos of a lust for life
'Cos of a lust for life
I'm worth a million in prizes
With my torture film
Drive a G.T.O.
Wear a uniform
All on a government loan
I'm worth a million in prizes
Yeah I'm through with sleeping on the
Sidewalk - no more beating my brains
With the liquor and drugs
With the liquor and drugs
Well I am just a modern guy
Of course I've had it in the ear before
'Cos of a lust for life
'Cos of a lust for life
I got a lust for life
Got a lust for life
Oh a lust for life
Oh a lust for life
A lust for life
I got a lust for life
I got a lust for life
Well I am just a modern guy
Of course I've had it in the ear before
'Cos of a lust for life
'Cos of a lust for life
'Cos of a lust for life

Here comes Johnny Yen again
With the liquor and drugs
And the flesh machine
He's gonna do another striptease
Hey man where'd you get
That lotion? Your skin starts
Itching once you buy the gimmick
About something called love
Oh love love love
That's like hypnotizing chickens
Well I am just a modern guy
Of course I've had it in the ear before
'Cos of a lust for life
'Cos of a lust for life
Got a lust for life
Yeah a lust for life
I got a lust for life
Oh a lust for life
I got a lust for life
Yeah a lust for life
I got a lust for life
A lust for life
Lust for life
Lust for life




Madman

(Marc Bolan/Steve Harley)

When a man is a man, he's destructive
When a man is a man, he's seductive
When a woman is a sensitive thing
When a woman is a woman, he's a madman
Madman - Madman- Madman - Madman

When a man is a friend, he's a stranger
When a man is a man, he's no angel
When a woman is a sensitive thing
When a woman is a woman, he's a madman

Madman - Madman - Madman - Madman




Maggie's Farm

(Bob Dylan)

I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more
No, I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more
Well, I wake in the morning
Fold my hands and pray for rain
I got a head full of ideas
That are drivin' me insane
It's a shame the way she makes me scrub the floor
I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more

I ain't gonna work for Maggie's brother no more
No, I ain't gonna work for Maggie's brother no more
Well, he hands you a nickel
He hands you a dime
He asks you with a grin
If you're havin' a good time
Then he fines you every time you slam the door
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's brother no more

I ain't gonna work for Maggie's pa no more
No, I ain't gonna work for Maggie's 'Pa no more
Well, he puts his cigar
Out in your face just for kicks
His bedroom window
It is made out of bricks
The National Guard stands around his door
Ah, I ain't gonna work for Maggie's pa no more

I ain't gonna work for Maggie's ma no more
No, I ain't gonna work for Maggie's 'ma no more
Well, she talks to all the servants
About man and God and law
Everybody says
She's the brains behind pa
She's sixty-eight, but she says she's twenty-four
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's ma no more

I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more
No, I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more
Well, I try my best
To be just like I am
But everybody wants you
To be just like them
They sing while you slave and I just get bored
I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more

(Performed live with Tin Machine during the 1989 tour).





Magic Dance

 

You remind me of the baby
What baby? The baby with the power
What power? Power of voodoo
Who do? You do
Do what? Remind me of the baby

I saw my baby, crying hard as babe could cry
What could I do?

Maid Of Bond Street

 

This girl is made of lipstick
Powder and paint
Sees the pictures of herself
Every magazine on every shelf

This girl is maid of Bond Street
Hailing cabs, lunches with executives
Gleaming teeth sip aperitifs

This girl is a lonely girl
Takes the train from Paddington to Oxford Circus
Buys the Daily News
But passengers don't smile at her, don't smile at her

This girl is made of loneliness
A broken heart
For the boy that she once knew
Doesn't want to know her anymore

And this girl is a lonely girl
Every thing she wants is hers
But she can't make it with the boy she really wants to be with
All the time, to love, all the time

This boy is made of envy
Jealousy
He doesn't have a limousine
Really wants to be a star himself

This girl, her world is made of flashlights and films
Her cares are scraps on the cutting room floor

And maids of Bond Street drive round in chauffeured cars
Maids of Bond Street picture clothes, eyes of stars
Maids of Bond Street shouldn't have worldly cares
Maids of Bond Street shouldn't have love affairs




Man In The Middle

(Mark Pritchett)

Like an inventor
He is a symbol of a new age
He glides above the realms
Of you and me
He flows through your life
And makes you feel quite small
You may sit up in your chair
He doesn't care at all

He's the man in the middle
You can tell which way he lays
He's the man in the middle
And he realises
And he realises
And he realises
Beauty pays

His gowns come from Paris
Occasionally from Rome
He can go anywhere
Say back to his home
He flows through your life
And makes you feel quite small
Flashing to the white collars
Ha, he doesn't care at all

He's the man in the middle
You can tell which way he lays
He's the man in the middle
And he realises
And he realises
And he realises
Beauty pays
Please...

He's the man in the middle
You can tell which way he lays
He's the man in the middle
And he realises
And he realises
And he realises
Beauty pays

He's the man in the middle
You can tell which way he lays
He's the man in the middle
And he realises
And he realises
And he realises
Beauty pays
Please...




Man Without A Mouth

(Lyrics: Dave Gutter. Music: Gutter/McNaboe/Zoidis/Albee/Noyes/Roods/Ward)

In the morning, sounds the alarm
Is it a warning, of all the things to come
On my pillow, there is blood
I try to speak but only think of words
Reflecting windows, by the sun
My mouth is gone
Well damn the songs I've sung
If I had known
My mouth is gone

(Chorus)
  When a man, without a mouth
  Lets his dog out    (Oooooooo)
  He just runs away
  It's been so long since he has heard his name    (Oooooooo)
  When a man, without a mouth
  Wants to speak    (Oooooooo)
  He's got things to say

In my car, I hum a tune along to the radio song
When I go to work
It's just like this
Except there's no smile for the receptionist
Except I can't smoke my cigarette
When the boss says I'm late
I can't say back "It's metamorphosis"

Chorus (x2)




Maria

(Bernstein)

 

Maria
I once knew a girl named Maria

Mary Ann

(Ray Charles)

Well now, ol' Mary Ann, you know you sure look fine
Well now, ol' Mary Ann, you know you sure look fine
Well now, ol' Mary Ann, I love you all the time

Well now, ol' Mary Ann, I said baby don't you know
Well now, ol' Mary Ann, I said baby don't you know
Well now, ol' Mary Ann, you know I love you so

Well now, ol' Mary Ann, can I take you home tonight
Well now, ol' Mary Ann, can I take you home tonight
Well now, ol' Mary Ann, I'll make everything all right

(Cover version of Ray Charles song performed live by Davy Jones and The Manish Boys).





Mass Production

(Iggy Pop/David Bowie)

Before you go
Do me a favour
Give me a number
Of a girl almost like you
With legs almost like you
I'm buried deep in mass production
You're not nothing new
I like to drive along the freeways
See the smokestacks belching
Breasts turn brown
So warm and so brown

Though I try to die
You put me back on the line
Oh damn it to hell
Back on the line - hell
Back on the line
Again and again
I'm back on the line
Again and again
And I see my face here
And it's there in the mirror
And it's up in the air
And I'm down on the ground

By the way
I'm going for cigarettes
And since you've gotta go
Won't you do me that favour
Won't you give me that number
Won't you get me that girl
Yeah, she's almost like you
Yes, she's almost like you
And I'm almost like him
Yes, I'm almost like him
Yes, I'm almost like him
Yeah, I'm almost like
    him

Memory of a Free Festival



(Spoken: "Maybe I should announce it?
"Should I?
Memory Of A Free Festival")

The children of the Summer's end
Gathered in the dampened grass
We played our songs and felt the London sky
Resting on our hands
It was God's land
It was ragged and naive
It was Heaven

Touch, we touched the very soul
Of holding each and every life
We claimed the very source of joy ran through
It didn't, but it seemed that way
I kissed a lot of people that day

Oh, to capture just one drop of all the ecstasy that swept that afternoon
To paint that love upon a white balloon
And fly it from the toppest top of all the tops
That man has pushed beyon(d) his brain
Satori must be something just the same

We scanned the skies with rainbow eyes and saw machines of every shape and size
We talked with tall Venusians passing through
And Peter tried to climb aboard but the Captain shook his head
And away they soared
Climbing through the ivory vibrant cloud
Someone passed some bliss among the crowd
And we walked back to the road, unchained

"The Sun machine is coming down, and we're gonna have a party, ah-ah-ah
  The Sun machine is coming down, and we're gonna have a party, ah-ah-ah
  The Sun machine is coming down, and we're gonna have a party, ah-ah-ah
  The Sun machine is coming down, and we're gonna have a party, ah-ah-ah
  The Sun machine is coming down, Ooo-ah-ah
  The Sun machine is coming down, and we're gonna have a party, ooo-ah-ah
  The Sun machine is coming down, and we're gonna have a party, ah-ah-ah
  The Sun machine is coming down, and we're gonna have a party, ah-ah-ah
  The Sun machine is coming down, and we're gonna have a party"

Miracle Goodnight

 

Burning up each others love, burning up our lives
Tried all kinds of working out, miracle goodnight
Future full and empty knocking on my door
Ragged limbed and hungry mama
Miracle no more

(Skin tell me) turn it around
(Head tell me) make it alright
(Nobody dancing)

Morning star you're beautiful, yellow dime on high
Spin you round my little room, miracle goodnight
Evening flower all alone, puzzling capiche
Haven't got a death wish, just want a little more

CHORUS
  (Skin tell me) turn it around
  (Head tell me) make it alright
  (Nobody dancing) miracle goodnight
  (Breath tell me) turn it around
  (Heart tell me) make it alright
  (Nobody dancing) it was only make believe

I wish I was a sailor a thousand miles from here
I wished I had a future, anywhere

I love you in the morning sun, I love you in my dreams
I love the sound of making love, the feeling of your skin
The corner of your eyes, I long forever more
I never want to say goodnight, miracle goodnight

CHORUS

Don't want to know the past, I want to know the real deal
I really don't want to know that
The less we know, the better we feel

Morning star you're beautiful, yellow diamond high
Spinning around my little room, miracle

CHORUS

(Skin tell me) turn it around
(Moon tell me) make it alright
(Nobody dancing) it was only make believe

(Eyes tell me) turn it around
(News tell me) make it alright
(Nobody dancing)


Mit Mir In Deinem Traum

(David Bowie. Translation: Lisa Busch)

When I live my dream, I'll take you with me
Riding on a golden horse
We'll live within my castle, with people there to serve you
Happy at the sound of your voice

Maybe, I'll slay a dragon for you
Or banish wicked giants from the land
But you will find, that nothing in my dream can hurt you
We will only love each other as forever
When I live my dream

When I live my dream, I'll forgive the things you've told me
And the empty man you left behind
It's a broken heart that dreams, it's a broken heart you left me
Only love can live in my dream

I'll wish, and the thunder clouds will vanish
Wish, and the storm will fade away
Wish again, and you will stand before me while the sky will paint an overture
And trees will play the rhythm of my dream

When I live my dream, please be there to meet me
Let me be the one to understand
When I live my dream, I'll forget the hurt you gave me
Then we can live in our new land

Till the day my dream cascades around me
I'm content to let you pass me by
Till that day, you'll run to many other men
But let them know it's just for now
Erzähl ihnen von meinem Traum
Erzähl ihnen, der Star bist du
Erzähle, ich bin unerhört verträumt
Und mein Traum wird einmal war
Erzähle, dass ich träumen will
Erzähl ihr Lachen stört mich nicht
Vergiss nur nicht dein Rendevous
Mit mir in deinem Traum

(German version of When I Live My Dream, recorded at Trident Studios, Soho, London on 29th January 1969, to be used for an appearance on German television. Part German-English lyrics).





Modern Love

 

I know when to go out
I know when to stay in
And get things done

I catch the paper boy
But things don't really change
I'm standing in the wind
But I never wave bye-bye

But I try, I try

There's no sign of life
It's just the power to charm
I'm lying in the rain
But I never wave bye-bye

But I try, I try

Never gonna fall for

CHORUS
  Modern love - walks beside me
  Modern love - walks on by
  Modern love - gets me to the church on time
  Church on time - terrifies me
  Church on time - makes me party
  Church on time - puts my trust in God and Man
  God and Man - no confession
  God and Man - no religion
  God and Man - don't believe in modern love

It's not really work
It's just the power to charm
Still standing in the wind
But I never wave bye bye

But I try, I try

Never gonna fall for

CHORUS

  Modern love - walks beside me
  Modern love - walks on by
  Modern love - gets me to the church on time
  Church on time - terrifies me
  Church on time - makes me party
  Church on time - puts my trust in God and Man
  God and Man - no confession
  God and Man - no religion
  God and Man - I don't believe in modern love

  Modern love - walks beside me
  Modern love - walks on by
  Modern love - gets me to the church on time
  Church on time - terrifies me
  Church on time - makes me party
  Church on time - puts my trust in God and Man
  God and Man - no confession
  God and Man - no religion
  God and Man - I don't believe in modern love

Modern love - Modern love (x 12)

Modern love - Modern love, walks beside me
Modern love - Modern love, walks on by

Moonage Daydream

 

I'm an alligator, I'm a mama-papa coming for you
I'm the space invader, I'll be a rock 'n' rollin' bitch for you
Keep your mouth shut, you're squawking like a pink monkey bird
And I'm busting up my brains for the words

Keep your 'lectric eye on me babe
Put your ray gun to my head
Press your space face close to mine, love
Freak out in a moonage daydream oh yeah!

Don't fake it baby, lay the real thing on me
The church of man love is such a holy place to be
Make me baby, make me know you really care
Make me jump into the air

Keep your 'lectric eye on me babe
Put your ray gun to my head
Press your space face close to mine, love
Freak out in a moonage daydream oh yeah!  (yeah)
  (repeat x3)

Freak out, far out, in out




Moonage Daydream (Arnold Corns version)

 

Come on strong girl
And lay a heavy trip on me
The church of man love
Is such a holy place to be
Make me baby
Make me know you really care
Make me jump into the air

CHORUS
  Keep your 'lectric eye on me babe
  Put your ray gun to my head
  Press your space face close to mine love
  Freak out in a moonage daydream, oh yeah!

Oh, right on!
Come on you mothers!
Far out!

Keep your mouth shut
And listen to the word inside
Keep your head on
And open up your eyes real wide
Keep the chain strong
Let me fix it for you inside
There isn't any room to hide

CHORUS (x2)

Ow!
Uhhh
Uhhh
Take it all, take it all
Ahhh!
Ahhh!
Pretty

Moss Garden





(Recorded during the "Heroes" sessions at Hansa Tonstudio, Berlin, Germany in 1977).

 

Sometimes I feel
The need to move on
So I pack a bag
And move on
Move on

Well I might take a train
Or sail at dawn
Might take a girl
When I move on
When I move on

Somewhere, someone's calling me
When the chips are down
I'm just a travelling man
Maybe it's just a trick of the mind, but
Somewhere there's a morning sky
Bluer than her eyes
Somewhere there's an ocean
Innocent and wild

Africa is sleepy people
Russia has its horsemen
Spent some nights in old Kyoto
Sleeping on the matted ground

Cyprus is my island
When the going's rough
I would love to find you
Somewhere in a place like that

Somewhere, someone's calling me
When the chips are down
I stumble like a blind man
Can't forget you
Can't forget you

Feeling like a shadow
Drifting like a leaf
I stumble like a blind man
Can't forget you
Can't forget you

Can't forget you
Can't forget you

(Recorded during the Lodger sessions at Mountain Studios, Montreux, Switzerland in 1979).





Movin' On

 

(Partial lyrics)

You go out at night from your sixty dollar single down in West Hollywood
With your ripped off clothes that are bulging at the seams
I can't believe that you don't know you look ugly
I mean, are you really all that dumb?
I mean, I don't want you to be that dumb you know
But you are
You're just dumb

Straight out of the cradle and into the hole with you
He begins screaming
When I walk through the door
I'm your new breed of whore
We will now drink to me

(Recorded with Iggy Pop at Oz Studios, Hollywood, USA in May 1975).





Music Is Lethal

(English Lyrics: David Bowie. Music: Lucio Battisti)

My friend, myself
Boredom's hero
Prince of the alleys
Stumble falling to a winsome table in search of wine

Mulatto hookers
Cocaine bookers
Troubled husbands
Stoned on freedoms, that only evening unfolds to shine

Through the twisting inn of screaming pleasure, two wet lips of infant leisure smiled
Could I grasp at the stars?
As they play your night blue hair

Sable eyes, Ebony thighs
She shines forever
Dancer be, dancing free
She shines for me

So a masked man should mourn
The passing of night time
The warped metal dirge
We were prisoners no more
Of the cruel fallen angels
She will shine on for me

Let the panting begin
Though the music is lethal
Let the night take me in
You know the daybreak shall win
She will shine on forever
He will shine on for me

While jeering waiters, grope at your shoulders
I drink your kisses
Exquisite room, my charming tomb
I see the man
With marble hands
Your smooth pimp Piranha
Cradles my swimming head
Cracks his glass, into my face, I'm thrown away

And then I'm tossed a-bleeding out on the street
Ask me John not to drag me away
And I curse where I lay
Then he bowed with thanks some way

Ten thousand engines, skid unwielding
Puncture my skin
Bait and taunt
For me to run, back to my rooms

Though the bad taste of sleep
Clutching my pillow
In anger I weep
She will cry on my chest
She will shine on forever
She will shine on for me

Let the tempting begin
Though the music is lethal
Let the night take me in
You know the daybreak shall win
She will shine on forever
She will shine on for me

Ahhh, yeah
Oh, ohhhhh




My Death

(Jacques Brel. Translation: Mort Schuman/Eric Blau)

My death waits like an old Drouet
So confident I'll go his way
Whistle to him and the passing time
My death waits like a Bible truth
At the funeral of my youth
We drank for that and the passing time
My death waits like a witch at night
As surely as our love is bright
Let's not think about the passing time

CHORUS
  But whatever lies behind the door
  There is nothing much to do
  Angel or devil, I don't care
  For in front of that door, there is you

My death waits like a beggar blind
Who sees the world through an unlit mind
Throw him a dime for the passing time
My death waits there between your thighs
Your cool fingers will close my eyes
Let's not think of that and the passing time
My death waits to allow my friends
A few good times before it ends
So let's drink to that and the passing time

CHORUS

My death waits there among the leaves
In magician's mysterious sleeves
Rabbits and dogs and the passing time
My death waits there among the flowers
Where the blackest shadow, blackest shadow cowers
Let's pick lilacs for the passing time
My death waits there in a double bed
Sails of oblivion at my head
So pull up the sheets against the passing time

CHORUS

(Performed live during various Ziggy Stardust World Tours 1972-1973).





Nathan Adler - Segue 1

(Lyrics: David Bowie. Music: Bowie/Gabrels/Garson/Kizilcay/Campbell)

Old Touchshriek was the main nameserver
Suspected of being a shoulder surfer
But he didn't know from shit
About challenge response systems
Now Ramona A. Stone we know was selling interest drugs
She got males all hung up on her mind filters
She was, if you don't mine me saying so, an update demon
Now Leon
He couldn't wait for 12 o'clock midnight
He jumps up on the stage
With a criss criss machete
And slashes around cutting a zero on everything
I mean a zero in the fabric of time itself
Was this a suspect?
I says to myself
"Woa! Quelle courage!"
Oh wait, I'm getting ahead of myself
Let me take you back to when it all began




Nathan Adler - Segue 2

(Lyrics: David Bowie. Music: Bowie/Gabrels/Garson/Kizilcay/Campbell)

Ramona is so cold
When she broke it off with Leon
She said "The ring is enough, I don't wanna see this face again"
Ramona was so cold
Ramona was so cold




Nature Boy (Version 1)

(eden ahbez)

(Spoken: Ewan McGregor): (This story is about... love. The woman I lo.. loved... is dead).

There was a boy
A very strange enchanted boy
They say he wandered very far, very far
Over land and sea
A little shy and sad of eye
But very wise was he

And then one day
One magic day he passed my way
While we spoke of many things
Fools and kings
This he said to me:
"The greatest thing you'll ever learn
Is just to love and be loved in return"




Nature Boy (Version 2)

(Lyrics: eden ahbez. Music: Massive Attack)

There was a boy
A very strange enchanted boy
They say he wandered very far, very far
Over land and sea
A little shy and sad of eye
But very wise was he

And then one day
One magic day he passed my way
And while we spoke of many things
Fools and kings
This he said to me:
"The greatest thing you'll ever learn
Is just to love and be loved in return"




Needles On The Beach

(David Bowie/Reeves Gabrels/Tony Sales/Hunt Sales)






Neighbourhood Threat

(Lyrics: Iggy Pop. Music: David Bowie/Ricky Gardiner)

Down where your paint is cracking
Look down your backstairs buddy
Somebody's living there and
He don't really feel the weather
And he don't share your pleasures
No he don't share your pleasures
Look at his eyes
Did you see his crazy eyes
You're so surprised he don't run to catch your ash
Everybody always wants to kiss your trash

You can't help him
Nobody can
Now that he knows
There's nothing to get
Will you still place your bet
On the neighborhood threat

Somewhere a baby's bleeding
Somewhere a mother's needing
Outside a boy is lying
But mostly he is crying
And he just shouts in anger
You'll find him interesting
Look at his eyes
Did you see his crazy eyes
You're so surprised he doesn't build for you
Everybody always wants to run with you

(Recorded during the "Heroes" sessions at Hansa Tonstudio, Berlin, Germany in 1977).





Never Let Me Down

(David Bowie/Carlos Alomar)

When I believed in nothing
I called her name
Trapped in a high-dollar joint in some place
I called her name
And though my days were slipping by
And nights so cruel I thought I'd die
She danced her little dance 'till it made me cry
She was shakin' like this honey doing that

When I needed soul revival
I called your name
When I was falling to pieces
I screamed in pain

Her soothing hand that turns me round
A love so real swept over me
You danced your little dance 'till it made me cry
You were shakin' like this honey doing that

Never let me down
She never let me down
Never let me down
She never let me down

When all your faith is failing
Call my name
When you've nothing coming
Call my name

I'll be strong for all it takes
I'll cover your head till the bad stuff breaks
Dance my little dance till it makes you smile
Shaking like this honey doing that

Never let you down
I'll never let you down
I'll never let you down
I'll never let you down
Oh no

(Whistling)

('I'm Tired' was a Carlos Alomar composition that was rewritten by David and became 'Never Let Me Down').





New Angels Of Promise

(David Bowie/Reeves Gabrels)

VERSE 1
  New angels of promise
  We despair
  We are the dead dreams
  We take the blame
  Take us to the edge of time
  Take us to the edge of time
  We are the fabulous lovers
  I am a blind man
  She is my eyes

CHORUS (x2)
  Suspicious minds
  You didn't feel us coming in this lonely crowd
  It's always time

VERSE 2
  New angels of promise
  We despise
  Don't fall apart now
  We are the silent ones

  Take us to the edge of time
  Take us to the edge of time
  We are the tabular lovers
  We listen to the storm

CHORUS (x2)

VERSE 1

CHORUS (x2)

It's always time (repeat)




New York's In Love

 

Yes
Do you see that thing?
I'm sure it's love
Would you do one thing?
New York's in love
The city grew wings in the back of night
The clouds are stuck like candy-floss
She sees the rich trash having all the fun
Makes her wonder where they get their energy from
There's nothing you can do to her
The city's all clean and waiting
I don't mean to wait too long
But this joint can't get much higher

CHORUS
  New York's in love
  With her big green eyes
  And her long blonde hair
  New York's in flames
  New York's in love
  With the way she talks, t-t-talk, t-t-talks
  And the way she walks
  New York's in love
  Goo goo goo goo goo goo

My, oh my, it's a tom-tom beat
No-one knows they've had their day
We can dance and we can see the singles swing
Everybody's waiting for the go-go boys
You've turned to stone by the family
It's how the dead speak to the living
Nothing left here but a raging blaze
And I don't mean to wait too long

CHORUS
  New York's in love
  With her big green eyes
  And her long blonde hair
  New York's in flames
  New York's in love
  With the way she talks
  And the way she walks, walk that walk
  New York's in love
  Goo goo goo goo goo goo

Pretty as a picture

New York, New York
Rent me a missile

New York's in love, New York's in love
New York's in flames

New York's in love
New York, New York




Night Clubbing

(Iggy Pop/David Bowie)

Nightclubbing we're nightclubbing
We're what's happening
Nightclubbing we're nightclubbing
We're an ice machine
We see people brand new people
They're something to see
When we're nightclubbing
Bright-white clubbing
Oh isn't it wild?

Nightclubbing we're nightclubbing
We're walking through town
Nightclubbing we're nightclubbing
We walk like a ghost
We learn dances brand new dances
Like the nuclear bomb
When we're nightclubbing
Bright white clubbing
Oh isn't it wild...




Nite Flights

(Scott Engels)

There's no hold
The moving has come through
The danger passing you
Turns its face into the heat and runs the tunnels
It's so cold
The dark dug up by dogs
The stitches torn and broke
The raw meat fist you choke
Has hit the bloodlite

Glass traps open and close on nite flights
Broken necks feather weights press the walls
Be my love, we will be Gods on nite flights
With only one promise, only one way to fall

Glass traps open and close on nite flights
Broken necks feather weight press the walls
Be my love, we will be Gods on nite flights
With only one promise, only one way to fall

On nite flights
On nite flights
On nite flights
Only one way to fall

On nite flights
On nite flights
On nite flights
Only one way to fall

No Control

(Lyrics: David Bowie. Music: David Bowie/Brian Eno)

Stay away from the future
Back away from the light
It's all deranged
No control

Sit tight in your corner
Don't tell God your plans
It's all deranged
No control

If I could control tomorrow's haze
The darkened shore would not bother me
If I can't control the web we weave
My life will be lost in fallen leaves

Every single move's uncertain
Don't tell God your plans
It's all deranged
No control

I shall live my life on bended knee
If I can't control my destiny
You've gotta have a scheme
You've gotta have a plan
In the world of today, for tomorrow's man

No control

Stay away from the future
Don't tell God your plans
It's all deranged
No control

Forbidden worlds, deafen me
In memory
No control
See how far a sinful man
Burn his tracks, his bloody robes
You've gotta have a scheme
You've gotta have a plan
In the world of today, for tomorrow's man

I shall live my lies on bended knee
If I can't control my destiny
No control
I can't believe I've no control
It's all deranged
I can't believe I've no control
It's all deranged
Deranged
Deranged




No One Calls

(Lyrics: David Bowie. Music: David Bowie/Reeves Gabrels)

Nobody calls
Fall into pieces
Don't be afraid
Life isn't easy

Sunshine to rain
Counting the windows

But nobody calls

Nobody calls

Sunshine to rain
Smile for the camera

But nobody phones
Nobody phones
Anyone
At all

Not at all (x3)

Nobody phones
Anyone
At all     (x4)

Not at all (x2 )




Nothing To Be Desired

(Lyrics: David Bowie. Music: David Bowie/Brian Eno)

Nothing to be desired
Nothing to be desired any more

Mind changing

And there's nothing to be desired
Nothing to be desired

Nothing to be desired

Nothing to be desired
It's not mind changing
Mind changing
Change your mind changing
Mind changing
Change your mind changing
Mind changing
Change your mind changing

O Superman

(Laurie Anderson)

O Superman. O judge. O Mom and Dad. Mom and Dad
O Superman. O judge. O Mom and Dad. Mom and Dad

Hi. I'm not home right now
But if you want to leave a message
Just start talking at the sound of the tone

Hello? This is your Mother
Are you there? Are you coming home?
Hello? Is anybody home?

Well, you don't know me, but I know you.
And I've got a message to give to you.
Here come the planes.
So you better get ready.
Ready to go.
You can come as you are, but pay as you go
Pay as you go

And I said:
  OK. Who is this really?
And the voice said:
  This is the hand, the hand that takes
  This is the hand, the hand that takes
  This is the hand, the hand that takes

Here come the planes
They're American planes
Made in America
Smoking or non-smoking?

And the voice said:
  Neither snow nor rain nor gloom of night shall
  stay these couriers from the swift completion
  of their appointed rounds
  'Cos when love is gone, there's always justice
  And when justice is gone, there's always force
  And when force is gone, there's always Mom

Hi Mom!
So hold me, Mom, in your long arms
So hold me, Mom, in your long arms
In your automatic arms
Your electronic arms
In your arms
So hold me, Mom, in your long arms
Your petrochemical arms
Your military arms
In your electronic arms

(Performed live during the Earthling World Tour 1997. Lead vocals by Gail Ann Dorsey).





Oh! Darling

 

(See Don't Be Afraid)





Oh! You Pretty Things

 

Wake up you sleepy head
Put on some clothes, shake up your bed
Put another log on the fire for me
I've made some breakfast and coffee
Look out my window what do I see?
Crack in the sky and a hand reaching down to me
All the nightmares came today
And it looks as though they're here to stay

What are we coming to?
No room for me, no fun for you
I think about a world to come
Where the books were found by the Golden Ones
Written in pain, written in awe
By a puzzled man who questioned
What we were here for
All the strangers came today
And it looks as though they're here to stay

Oh! You pretty things
Don't you know you're driving your Mama's and Papa's insane
Oh! You pretty things
Don't you know you're driving your Mama's and Papa's insane
Let me make it plain
You gotta make way for the Homo Superior

Look out at your children
See their faces in golden rays
Don't kid yourself they belong to you
They're the start of the coming race
The Earth is a bitch
We've finished our news
Homo Sapiens have outgrown their use
All the strangers came today
And it looks as though they're here to stay

Oh! You pretty things
Don't you know you're driving your Mama's and Papa's insane
Oh! You pretty things
Don't you know you're driving your Mama's and Papa's insane
Let me make it plain
Gotta make way for the Homo Superior




One Shot - (Original Version)

(David Bowie/Reeves Gabrels/Tony Sales/Hunt Sales)

Ooo-oo-oo-oh, oo-oo-oo-oh
Ooo-oo-oo-oh, oo-oo-ooo

Last days were the meanest
Leanest days of our lives
You threw me the pieces
I started the fires
One thing led to a dead end
One shot put her away, hey-hey

Look out on a green world
Windows and wives
No bedroom to run to
No miracle jive - no conversation

Then nothing meant nothing
Ten dollars tore us apart
One thing led to a dead end
One shot put her away, hey-hey

One day nothing meant nothing
Ten dollars tore us apart
One thing led to a dead end
And one shot put her away, hey-hey

Look out on a green world
Windows and wives
No bedroom to run to
No woman alive

Hot love is the dearest
No money can buy
She burnt like a Spitfire
One shot put her away, hey-hey

One shot put her away
One shot put her away, hey-hey yeah
One shot put her away
Uh-huh-huh, uh-huh-huh
Uh-huh-huh, uh-huh-huh
Uh-huh-huh, uh-huh-huh


(This original version was intended for the final album master. At the last minute the band decided to go back into the studio and re-record the song in a different key and with various arrangement tweaks).





One Shot

(David Bowie/Reeves Gabrels/Tony Sales/Hunt Sales)

Ooo-oo-oo-oh, oo-oo-oo-oh
Ooo-oo-oo-oh, oo-oo-ooo

The last days were the meanest
Leanest days of our lives
You threw me the pieces
I started the fire
One thing led to a dead end
One shot put her away, hey-hey

Look out on a green world
Windows and wives
No bedroom to run to
No miracle jive - no conversation

Then nothing meant nothing
Ten dollars tore us apart
One thing led to a dead end
One shot put her away

One day nothing meant nothing
Ten dollars tore us apart
One thing led to a dead end
One shot put her away

The last days were the meanest
Leanest days of our lives
One thing led to a dead end
One shot further away

Looked out on a green world
Windows and wives
No bedroom to run to
No miracle jive - no conversation

Hot love is the dearest
No money can buy
She burnt like a Spitfire
One shot put her away

One shot put her away, heh-heh
One shot put her away, uh-huh-huh, uh-huh-huh
Oo-oo-oo-oh, uh-huh-huh, uh-huh-huh
Oo-oo-oo-oh, uh-huh-huh, uh-huh-huh
Oo-oo-oo-oh, uh-huh-huh, uh-huh-huh
Oo-oo-oo-oh, uh-huh-huh, uh-huh-huh
Oo-oo-oo-oh, uh-huh-huh
One shot put her away




Only One Paper Left

Opening Titles Including Underground

(Lyrics: David Bowie. Music David Bowie/Trevor Jones)

It's only forever
Not long at all
The lost and lonely

No one can blame you
For walking away
Too much rejection, nah nah
No love injection, nah nah
Life can be easy
It's not always swell
Don't tell me truth hurts, little girl
'Cos it hurts like hell (echo hurts like hell)

But down in the underground
You'll find someone true
Down in the underground
A land serene
A crystal moon, ah, ah

It's only forever
It's not long at all
Lost and lonely
That's underground
Underground




Outside

(Lyrics: David Bowie. Music: David Bowie/Kevin Armstrong)

(Spoken): 25th, 7, 8th

Now
Not tomorrow
Yesterday
Not tomorrow

It happens today
The damage today
They fall on today
They beat on the outside
And I'll stand by you, now

Not tomorrow
It's happening now
Not tomorrow

It's happening now
The crazed in the hot-zone
The mental and diva's hands
The fisting of life
To the music outside
To the music outside

It happens outside
The music is outside
It's happening outside
The music is outside
It's happening, now
Not tomorrow
Yesterday
Not tomorrow

The music is outside
It's happening outside
The music is outside
The music is outside
Outside

Over The Wall We Go - (version 1)

 

Over the wall we go
All coppers are 'nanas
Over the wall we go
Leave 'em a note saying "Wish you was here"
I know the best ways to break out of here
I helped a young laddie called Ivan
Over the wall last night
Then he climbed back and he grabbed me tight
He uttered some words that I can't say to you
'Cos he remembered that he was a screw

Over the wall we go
All coppers are 'nanas
Over the wall we go
Leave 'em a note wishing "Happy New Year"

My name is Henry, some say I'm thick
I've spent half me life in and out of nick
Me mum sends me presents to keep me in style
Soggy old cakes and hundreds of files
God sussed all them files, I'm a clever young man
Now I'm just stupid with manicured hands

Over the wall we go
All coppers are 'nanas
Over the wall we go
Nobody's left and the screws are in tears

(spoken):
  "Double 3 427"  "Here Sir"
  "Double 3 428"  "Here Sir"
  "Double 3 429, Double 3 429, where is he?"
  "He went out for a cup of tea at the local football match Sir"
  "Oh... well he might have invited me"

Over the wall we go
All coppers are 'nanas
Over the wall we go
Nobody's left and the screws are in tears

We tried digging tunnels but gave up the ghost
Just past the Kensington Yards at the most
Our limbs was aching, we felt pretty pooped
Our clothes they was tatty, our hallows did droop
We crawled back to safety, our hearts filled with gloom
'Cos we'd dug ourselves through to the smallest room

Over the wall we go
All coppers are 'nanas
Over the wall we go
Leave 'em a note wishing "Happy New Year"

spoken
  (knock knock knock)
  "Hello, who is it?"
  "Double 3 429, guv"
  "Oh, hang on a minute...
   Hello sonny Jim
   Been wondering where you were
   Did you have a nice Christmas?"




Over The Wall We Go - (version 2)

 

Over the wall we go
All coppers are 'nanas
Over the wall we go
Leave 'em a note saying "Happy New Year"

I know all the best ways to break out of here
I helped a young laddie called Ivan
I bundled him over the wall last night
Then he climbed back and he grabbed me tight
He uttered some words that I can't say to you
'Cos he remembered that he was a screw

Over the wall we go
All coppers are 'nanas
Over the wall we go
Leave 'em a note saying "Happy New Year"

My name is Henry though some say I'm thick
I've spent half me life in and out of the nick
My mum sends me presents to keep me in style
Soggy old cakes and hundreds of files
Now I sussed all them files I'm a clever young man
Now I look stupid with manicured hands

Over the wall we go
All coppers are 'nanas
Over the wall we go
Leave 'em a note saying "Happy New Year"

(spoken):
  "Double 3 421" "Here"
  "Double 3 422" "Gruesome"
  "Double 3 423" "I'm here"
  "Double 3 424" "Hello"
  "Double 3 425" "Hi"
  "Double 3 426, Double 3 426, where is he?"
  "Here, keep it up the ledge another course and we're out"

Over the wall we go
All coppers are 'nanas
Over the wall we go
Leave 'em a note saying "Happy New Year"

My name is Reggie the scandalous mind
I got seven years so I gossip my time
I gave all the tickbits and pieces of newt
I'm a privileged corpse and my uniform is blue
The new lads would ask me if I am a screw
I'll tell them "Oh cheeky not even for you"

Over the wall we go
All coppers are 'nanas
Over the wall we go
Leave 'em a note saying "Happy New Year"

Over the wall we go
All coppers are 'nanas
Over the wall we go
Leave 'em a note saying "Happy New Year"

Over the wall we go
All coppers are 'nanas
Over the wall we go
Leave 'em a note saying "Happy New Year"




Pallas Athena

 

God is on top of it all
And that's all it is

Athena, Athena, Athena, Athena




Pancho

(Lyrics: David Bowie. Music: Willy Albimoor/Andree Cylene Giroud)

Pancho, the world is afraid of
Pancho, and no one speaks to
Pancho, rides his motorbike
Pancho, never shirking
Pancho, always fighting
Pancho, speeding down the highways and the byways
With the police on his tail
No one understands him
But for one girl and that's me

Pancho, I call you chou chou
Pancho, 'cos when he's with me
Pancho is a loving Pancho guy
Pancho, when you kiss me
Pancho, what can this mean?
Pancho, is this really you?

Pancho (x 3)

Eyes cold and determined
Like a knife flash in the dark
Pancho, my wicked Pancho
My darling Pancho, you stole my heart
Pancho, which disguises
Pancho, the loving kiss or
Pancho is it in those eyes?

Pancho, the world is afraid of
Pancho and no one talked to
Pancho, a face lit from inside

Pancho (x 3)




Panic In Detroit

 

Ow!
  (Bah oooooo, oooooo)

He looked a lot like Che Guevara, drove a diesel van
Kept his gun in quiet seclusion, such a humble man
The only survivor of The National People's Gang
Panic in Detroit, asked for an autograph
He wanted to stay home, I wish someone would phone
Panic in Detroit

He laughed at accidental sirens that broke the evening gloom
The police had warned of repercussions
They followed none too soon
A trickle of strangers were all that were left alive
Panic in Detroit, I asked for an autograph
He wanted to stay home, I wish someone would phone
Panic in Detroit

Putting on some clothes I made my way to school
And I found my teacher crouching in his overall
I screamed and ran to smash my favourite slot machine
And jumped the silent cars that slept the traffic lights

Having scored a trillion dollars, made a run back home
Found him slumped across the table, a gun and me alone
I ran to the window, looked for a plane or two
Panic in Detroit.  He'd left me an autograph
"Let me collect dust" I wish someone would phone
Panic in Detroit (x3)
Ow!

  You are incorrect
  Panic is spelt P-A-N-I-C

Perfect Day

(Lou Reed)

Just a perfect day
Drink Sangria in the park
And then later
When it gets dark
We go home

Just a perfect day
Feed animals in the zoo
Then later, a movie, too
And then home

CHORUS
  Oh it's such a perfect day
  I'm glad I spent it with you
  Oh! such a perfect day
  You just keep me hanging on
  You just keep me hanging on

Just a perfect day
Problems all left alone
Weekenders on our own
It's such fun

Just a perfect day
You made me forget myself
I thought I was someone else
Someone good

CHORUS

You're going to reap just what you sow (x4)

Oh! What a perfect day




Planet Of Dreams

(David Bowie/Gail Ann Dorsey)

Nothing on smoke today
Nothing dies on the wing
Wing's been losing time
And then I keep all the pain
Pain that comes and goes
It goes against all you see
You see I got Gable's eyes
And Eisenhower blames the poor
The poor huddled on the curb
Gotta get back in shape

We're backing up a major plan
We're treading on thin, thin ice
We're walking under golden sun
We're living in a Planet of Dreams
We're living in a Planet of Dreams
We're living in a Planet of Dreams
We're living in a Planet of Dreams
We're living in a Planet of Dreams
We're living in a Planet
(5 more times)

Do do do do (repeat ad inf.)




Play It Safe

(Iggy Pop/David Bowie)

Say Ta
Eisenhower saw the thing
Oh
Oh
He said this is sickening
Oh
I swear I saw the very thing
Oh
I saw it in America

Let's play safe
I never knew how
How to play safe
You told me how
How to play safe
A thousand times

I don't believe in fairies any more

Today I saw a very very thing
But that's another song
You're too simple minded
Let's play it safe

What do we have in common?
(It was a real thing)
Play it safe

What do we have in common?
Play it safe
I'll tell you something safe

I want to be a criminal
Play it safe
Oh I wanna be a criminal

I want to be a criminal
Play it safe
Well it's that real thing inside a criminal mind

What do we have in common?
Play it safe
That keeps me goin' all the time

What do we have in common?
Play it safe
That very very thing I find so sublime

I want to be a criminal
Play it safe
And I wanna know

I wanna know

I want to be a criminal
Play it safe
And I wanna know

I wanna know
I wanna know

What do we have in common?
Play it safe
Rockin' and reelin' like Al Capone

What do we have in common?
(Slippin' and slidin' like Joey Gallo)
And I wanna know

I wanna be a criminal
(Movin' and groovin' with a Son of Sam)
Play it safe

I wanna be a criminal
(Splish splash I was Jim Jones)
Play it safe




Pretty Pink Rose

 

Yeah, she's just been to Russia and they're dyeing their faces
They're dying over there
A pretty pink rose
(That rock 'n' roll lady takes a space-ship ride
She's out of this world
A pretty pink rose)

And we're living for you, my love
We're living for you
And we're dying for you, my love
Pretty pink rose

She tore down Paris on the tail of Thom Paine
But the left wing's broken, the right's insane
A pretty pink rose
(Ah, have a nice day, it's a killer, turn a cheek
It's a Christian code
A pretty pink rose)

And we're living for you, my love
Yes we're living for you
And we're dying for you, my love
Pretty pink rose

Ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh

She's the poor man's gold, she's the anarchist crucible
Flying in the face of the despot cannibal
Pretty pink rose
Never let it rain, never rain
On the heart of the pretty pink rose
Pretty pink rose

And we're living for you, my love
We're living for you
And we're dying for you, my love
Pretty pink rose

Ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh

Get me through the pain, through the pain
Of the thorn of the pretty pink rose
Never let it rain, never rain, never rain
On the pretty pink rose

(Take me to the heart, to the heart, to the heart
Of the pretty pink rose)
Never let it rain, never rain, never rain
(Take me to the heart, to the heart, to the heart)

Never never let it rain, never rain
(Take me to the heart, to the heart, to the heart
Of the pretty pink rose)
Never let it rain on the heart of the
(Take me to the heart, to the heart, to the heart)
Never let, never let it rain, never rain on the heart

(Take me to the heart, to the heart, to the heart
Of the pretty pink rose)
(Take me to the heart, to the heart, to the heart)
Never let it rain, never let it rain, never rain

(Take me to the heart, to the heart, to the heart)




Queen Bitch

 

Do-pe-to-cu-cum-ba-ba-ba-da-dah
Ahh yeah
Oh yeah

I'm up on the eleventh floor
And I'm watching the cruisers below
He's down on the street
And he's trying hard to pull sister Flo
Oh, my heart's in the basement
My weekend's at an all time low
'Cos she's hoping to score
So I can't see her letting him go
Walk out of her heart
Walk out of her mind
Oh loved her

She's so swishy in her satin and tat
In her frock coat and bipperty-bopperty hat
Oh God, I could do better than that
Oh yeah

She's an old-time ambassador
Of sweet talking, night walking games
Oh and she's known in the darkest clubs
For pushing ahead of the dames
If she says she can do it
Then she can do it, she don't make false claims

But she's a Queen, and such are Queens
That your laughter is sucked in their brains
Now she's leading him on
And she'll lay him right down
Yeah she's leading him on
And she'll lay him right down
But it could have been me
Yes, it could have been me
Why didn't I say, why didn't I say, no, no, no

She's so swishy in her satin and tat
In her frock coat and bipperty-bopperty hat
Oh God, I could do better than that

So I lay down a while
And I gaze at my hotel wall
Oh the cot is so cold
It don't feel like no bed at all
Yeah I lay down a while
And I look at my hotel wall
And he's down on the street
So I throw both his bags down the hall
And I'm phoning a cab
'Cos my stomach feels small
There's a taste in my mouth
And it's no taste at all
It could have been me
Oh yeah, it could have been me
Why didn't I say, why didn't I say, no, no, no

She's so swishy in her satin and tat
In her frock coat and bipperty-bopperty hat
Oh God, I could do better than that
Ohh, you betcha - oh yeah - uh-hu - mmm




Quicksand

 

I'm closer to the Golden Dawn
Immersed in Crowley's uniform
Of imagery
I'm living in a silent film
Portraying Himmler's sacred realm
Of dream reality
I'm frightened by the total goal
Drawing to the ragged hole
And I ain't got the power anymore
No I ain't got the power anymore

I'm the twisted name on Garbo's eyes
Living proof of Churchill's lies
I'm destiny
I'm torn between the light and dark
Where others see their target
Divine symmetry
Should I kiss the Viper's fang
Or herald loud the death of Man?
I'm sinking in the quicksand of my thought
And I ain't got the power anymore

Don't believe in yourself
Don't deceive with belief
Knowledge comes with death's release

I'm not a prophet or a stone age man
Just a mortal with potential of a superman
I'm living on
I'm tethered to the logic of Homo Sapien
Can't take my eyes from the great salvation of bullshit faith
If I don't explain what you ought to know
You can tell me all about it on the next Bardo
I'm sinking in the quicksand of my thought
And I ain't got the power anymore

Don't believe in yourself
Don't deceive with belief
Knowledge comes with death's release

Don't believe in yourself
Don't deceive with belief
Knowledge comes with death's release




Ramona A. Stone

(Lyrics: David Bowie. Music: Bowie/Eno/Gabrels/Garson/Kizilcay/Campbell)

I was Ramona A. Stone
I started with no enemies of my own
I was an artiste
In a tunnel
But I've been having a midi-life crisis
And I've been dreaming of sleep
And ape men with metal parts
I've spat upon deeply felt age
I've hid my hearts in
And I hate the funny coloured English
We'll creep together you and I
For I know who the small friends are




Ragazzo Solo, Ragazza Sola

(Lyrics: Ivan Mogul. Music: David Bowie)

(Lonely Boy, Lonely Girl - Italian Space Oddity)

La mia mente ha presol il volo
Un pensiero uno solo
Io cammino mentre dorme la citta'

I suoi occhi nella notte
Fanali bianchi nella notte
Una voce che mi parla chi sara'?

Dimmi ragazzo solo dove vai
Perche' tanto dolore?
Hai perduto senza dubbio un grande amore
Ma di amori e' tutta piena la citta'

No ragazza sola, no no no
Stavolta sei in errore
Non ho perso solamente un grande amore
Ieri sera ho perso tutto con lei

Ma lei
I colori della vita
Dei cieli blu
Una come lei non la trovero' mai piu'

Ora ragazzo solo dove andrai
La notte e' un grande mare
Se ti serve la mia mano per nuotare
Grazie ma stasera io vorrei morire
Perche' sai negli occhi miei
C'e' un angelo, un angelo
Che ormai non vola piu' che ormai non vola piu'
Che ormai non vola piu'
C'e' lei
I colori della vita
Dei cieli blu
Una come lei non la trovero' mai piu'




Real Cool World

 

So far this love is delightful
The face of seduction was you
But I listened for each and every footstep
In this Real Cool World

Questioning saint-like and fantastic heroes
Feeling like lost little children in fabled lands
So I listen for each and every friendship
In this Real Cool World

Now there is you
In my Real Cool World

Starry-eyed life but somehow believing in nothing
You whisper sweet nothing but reading between your lines
I listen, colour me doubtful
In this Real Cool World

Now there is you
In my Real Cool World
Mmm
Now there is you
In my Real Cool World

You came from nowhere
You came from nowhere
You held me you shook me away

It's a Cool World
It's a Cool World

It's a Real Cool World
It's a Real Cool World
It's a Real Cool World
It's a Real Cool World

Now there is you
In my Real Cool World

Now there is you
In my Real Cool World

Now there is you
In my Real Cool World

Real Cool World

Red Money

(Lyrics: David Bowie. Music: David Bowie/Carlos Alomar)

Oh, can you feel it in the way
That a man is not a man?
Can you see it in the sky
That the landscape is too high?

Like a nervous disease
And it's been there all along
It will tumble from the sky
It's been there all along

  Can you hear it fall
  Can you hear it well

And I could not give it away
And I knew I must not drop it
Stop it, take it away

Red Sails

(Lyrics: David Bowie. Music: David Bowie/Brian Eno)

Feel a bit roughed up, feel a bit frightened
Nearly pin it down some time
Red sail action wake up in the wrong town
Boy, I really get around

Thunder ocean
Thunder ocean
Red sails take me, make me sail along

Red sails, and a mast so tall
Red sails
Red sails

Do you remember we another person
Green and black and red and so scared
Graffiti on the wall kept us all in tune
Bringing us all back home

Red sails
Thunder ocean
Red sails
Sailor can't dance like you, ooh, yooou

Ahh, red sail
Red sail action
Red sail
Some reaction

Action boy seen living under neon
Struggle with a foreign tongue
Red sails make him strong
Action make him sail along
Life stands still and stares

The hinterland, the hinterland
We're gonna sail to the hinterland
And it's far far, far far far, far far far away
Its a far far, far far far, fa da, da da da

Remembering Marie A.

(Bertolt Brecht. Translation: Dominic Muldowney)

It was a day in that blue month September
Silent beneath the plum trees' slender shade
I held her there
My love, so pale and silent
As if she were a dream that must not fade

Above us in the shining summer heaven
There was a cloud my eyes dwelled long upon
It was quite white and very high above us
Then I looked up
And found that it had gone

And since that day, so many moons in silence
Have swum across the sky and gone below
The plum trees surely have been chopped for firewood
And if you ask, how does that love seem now
I must admit, I really can't remember
And yet I know what you are trying to say
But what her face was like, I know no longer
I only know I kissed it on that day

As for the kiss, I long ago forgot it
But for the cloud that floated in the sky
I know that still and shall forever know it
It was quite white and moved in very high
It may be that the plum trees still are blooming
That woman's seventh child may now be there
And yet that cloud had only bloomed for minutes
When I looked up
It vanished on the air

(Recorded for 1982 BBC TV production of Baal).





Repetition

 

Johnny is a man
And he's bigger than you
But his overheads are high
And he looks straight through when you ask him how the kids are

He'll get home around seven
'Cos the Chevy's real old
And he could have had a Cadillac
If the school had taught him right
And he could have married Anne with the blue silk blouse
He could have married Anne with the blue silk blouse

And the food is on the table
But the food is cold
Don't hit her

"Can't you even cook?
What's the good of me working when you can't damn cook?"

Well Johnny is a man
And he's bigger than her
I guess the bruises won't show
If she wears long sleeves
But the space in her eyes shows through

And he could have married Anne with the blue silk blouse
He could have married Anne with the blue silk blouse
Shows through
Shows through
Shows through

(Recorded during the Lodger sessions at Mountain Studios, Montreux, Switzerland in 1979).





Reptile

(Trent Reznor)

She spread her legs wide open to let the insects in
She leaves a trail of honey to show me where she's been
She has the blood of reptile just underneath her skin
Seeds from a thousand others drip down from within

Oh my beautiful liar
Oh my precious whore
My disease my infection
I am so impure

Devils speak of the way in which she'll manifest
Angels bleed from the tainted touch of my caress
Need to contaminate to alleviate this loneliness
I know now the depths I'll reach are limitless

Oh my beautiful liar
Oh my precious whore
My disease my infection
I am so impure

(Performed live with Nine Inch Nails during the Outside World Tour 1995 in the USA).





Revolutionary Song

(David Bowie/Jack Fishman)

When people call us revolutionary
They're just trying to see
All that we choose

When all we want is everybody free
The universe would be one brotherhood

It isn't wrong to be prepared to fight
Together to unite if we believe
In giving everything our heart and soul
Until we reach the goal we should achieve

It shouldn't matter if we're brown or white
Yellow or black as night to anyone
We're all born equal with the self same rights
Sharing the same daylight under the sun

If loving freedom makes me qualify
Of opportunity is where revolutionary
Constantly, fervently, firmly
Revolutionary




Ricochet

 

Like weeds on a rockface waiting for the scythe
Ricochet - ricochet
The world is on a corner waiting for jobs
Ricochet - ricochet
Turn the holy pictures so they face the wall
And who can bear to be forgotten?
And who can bear to be forgotten?

March of flowers, march of dimes
These are the prisons, these are the crimes
Men wait for news while thousands are still asleep
Dreaming of tramlines, factories, pieces of machinery
Mineshafts things like that
March of flowers, march of dimes
These are the prisons, these are the crimes
Sound of thunder, sound of gold
Sound of the Devil breaking parole
Ricochet - it's not the end of the world

Sound of thunder, sound of gold
Sound of the Devil breaking parole
Ricochet - ricochet
These are the prisons, these are the crimes
Teaching life in a violent new way
Ricochet - ricochet
Turn the holy pictures so they face the wall
And who can bear to be forgotten?
And who can bear to be forgotten?

March of flowers, march of dimes
These are the prisons, these are the crimes (crimes)
Early, before the sun, they struggle off to the gates
In their secret fearful places they see their lives
Unravelling before them

March of flowers - march of dimes
These are the prisons, these are the crimes
Sound of thunder, sound of gold
Sound of the Devil breaking parole
Ricochet - it's not the end of the world

But when they get home, damp eyed and weary
They smile and crush their children to their heaving chests
Making unfulfillable promises
For who can bear to be forgotten?

Now you know I'm living with my girl and it's real

Rock 'N' Roll Star - (1971 demo)

 

If someone had the sense to hear me
If someone had the time to see (yeah)
I could tell them who they are
About the rock 'n' roll stars

Someone has to build the buildings
Someone has to pull them down (yeah)
I could make it all worthwhile as a rock 'n' roll star

So inviting
It's so exciting
To play the part
I could make a big time noise as a rock 'n' star

I could do with that money
I'm so far down with things as they are
I'll send my photograph to my honey
And come on like a regular superstar

I could take your big time noise as a rock 'n' star

Try to get it on with the nation
Maybe I could change the world?
I could tell them I tried
I could make a transformation as a rock 'n' roll star

So inviting
It's so exciting
To play the part
I could make a big time noise as a rock 'n' star

I could do with that money
I'm so far down with things as they are
I'll send my photograph to my honey
And I'd come on like a regular superstar

I could fall asleep at night
As a rock 'n' roll (rock 'n' roll)
Rock 'n' roll (rock 'n' roll) star

I could fall in love all right
Like a rock 'n' roll (rock 'n' roll)
Rock 'n' roll (rock 'n' roll) star

(Demo recorded by Bowie at Radio Luxembourg Studios, 38 Hertford Street, London W1. Given to Les Payne, lead singer of the Chameleons, who recorded their unreleased version on 27th May 1971. Later recorded and renamed 'Star' by Bowie on 8th-11th November 1971 at Trident Studios, Soho, London for The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and The Spiders From Mars album).





Rock 'N' Roll Suicide

 

Time takes a cigarette, puts it in your mouth
You pull on your finger, then another finger, then your cigarette
The water-wall is calling, it lingers, then you forget
Ohhh, you're a rock 'n' roll suicide

You're too old to lose it, too young to choose it
And the clock waits so patiently on your song
You walk past a cafe but you don't eat when you've lived too long
Oh, no, no, no,  you're a rock 'n' roll suicide

Chev brakes are snarling as you stumble across the road
But the day breaks instead so you hurry home
Don't let the sun blast your shadow
Don't let the milk float ride your mind
They're so natural - religiously unkind

Oh no love! you're not alone
You're watching yourself, but you're too unfair
You got your head all tangled up, but if I could only make you care
Oh no love! You're not alone
No matter what or who you've been
No matter when or where you've seen
All the knives seem to lacerate your brain
I've had my share, I'll help you with the pain
You're not alone

Just turn on with me and you're not alone
Let's turn on with me and you're not alone
Let's turn on and be not alone
Gimme your hands 'cos you're wonderful
Gimme your hands 'cos you're wonderful
Oh gimme your hands




Rock 'N Roll With Me

(Lyrics: David Bowie. Music: David Bowie/Geoff MacCormack)

You always were the one that knew
They sold us for the likes of you
I always wanted new surroundings
A room to rent while the lizards lay crying in the heat
Trying to remember who to meet
I would take a foxy kind of stand
While tens of thousands found me in demand

When you rock 'n roll with me
No one else I'd rather be
Nobody here can do it for me
I'm in tears again
When you rock 'n roll with me

Gentle hearts are counted down
The queue is out of sight and out of sounds
Me, I'm out of breath, but not quite doubting
I've found a door which lets me out!

When you rock 'n roll with me
No one else I'd rather be
Nobody down here can do it for me
I'm in tears again
When you rock 'n roll with me

Oooo-oo-oo-oo

Oh, when you rock 'n roll with me
There's no one else I'd rather be, oh
Nobody down here can do it for me
When you rock 'n roll with me

When you rock 'n roll, rock 'n roll with me
No one else I'd rather, I'd rather be
Nobody down here can do it for me
I'm in tears, I'm in tears
When you rock 'n roll with me

(Recorded during the Diamond Dogs sessions at the Olympic Studios, Barnes, London SW13 in 1974).

Rosalyn

(Jimmy Duncan/Bill Farley)

Hey Rosalyn, tell me where you've been
Hey Rosalyn, tell me where you've been
All the night and all the day
Hide and seek's the game you play
Treating me as sure as sin

Oh Rosalyn, yeah Rosalyn

VERSE
  Hey Rosalyn, you're the girl for me
  Hey Rosalyn, you're the girl for me
  When I'm holding you so tight
  It's so hard to say goodnight
  It's you that I love now can't you see?

CHORUS
  Do you really love me, do you love me true
  Do you really love me Rosalyn?
  Yeah gotta know, yeah gotta know
  Yeah gotta know Rosalyn

VERSE

CHORUS

Yeah gotta know, yeah gotta know
Yeah gotta know Rosalyn

Yeah Rosalyn, Rosalyn, Rosalyn, Rosalyn, ooh-yeah, ah




Round And Round

(Chuck Berry)

Well, the joint was rocking
CHORUS
  Going round 'n' round
  Yeah, reeling and a-rocking
  What a crazy sound
  Well, they never stopped rocking
  'Til the moon went down

Well it sounded so sweet
I had to take me a chance
I rose out of my seat
And had to dance
I started moving my feet
And clapping my hands

Yeah, we kept on rocking

CHORUS

About twelve o'clock
When the place was packed
The front doors were locked
I said the place was packed
When the police knocked
Those doors flew back

But kept on rocking

CHORUS

Yeah

About twelve o'clock
Around lock up time
Well, the doors were locked
Said the place was packed
When  the police knocked
Those doors flew back

But it kept on rocking

CHORUS

Yeah, it kept on rocking

CHORUS




Rubber Band

 

Rubber Band
There's a rubber band that plays tunes out of tune
In the Library Garden, Sunday afternoon
While a little chappie waves a golden wand

Rubber Band
In 1910 I was so handsome and so strong
My moustache was stiffly waxed and one foot long
And I loved a girl while you played tea-time tunes

Dear Rubber Band, you're playing my tune out of tune, oh

Rubber Band
Won't you play a haunting theme again to me?
While I eat my scones and drink my cup of tea
The sun is warm but it's a lonely afternoon

Oh, play that theme

Rubber Band
How I wish that I could join your Rubber Band
We could play in Library Parks throughout the land
And one Sunday afternoon, I'd find my love

Rubber Band
In the '14-'18 war I went to sea
Thought my Sunday love was waiting home for me
And now she's married to the leader of your band, oh

(spoken)
Oh yeah... I hope you break your baton

Run

(David Bowie/Kevin Armstrong)

Wish I were a sailor
Crossing an azure sea
Under leaden skies
Under your eyes

But I can't see too far
With these animal eyes
Can't hold my breath
Without your voice

An' I'm danger-prone
I'll be bound
I'll be fast as hell
Without your touch

An' I'll run run run run run
An' I'll run run run run run
Without your love

I'm a goldman
I'm a soaring tower
And it's cold in here
Without your love

Trouble in here - trouble out there
Mainline problems til you no longer care
Get a long-low life - it's duty bound
No hope - no life - no you - ah ha

And I run run run
Run run run
Without your love

I duck the shots - tilt the world
I talk myself crazy - shoot the breeze
Shout to live - shoot to kill
Double up in pain - I'm on my knees




Running Gun Blues

 

I count the corpses on my left, I find I'm not so tidy
So I better get away, better make it today
I've cut twenty-three down since Friday
But I can't control it, my face is drawn
My instinct still emotes it

I slash them cold, I kill them dead
I broke the gooks, I cracked their heads
I'll bomb them out from under the beds
But now I've got the running gun blues

It seems the peacefuls stopped the war
Left Generals squashed and stifled
But I'll slip out again tonight
'Cause they haven't taken back my rifle
For I promote oblivion
And I'll plug a few civilians

I'll slash them cold, I'll kill them dead
I'll break them gooks, I'll crack their heads
I'll slice them till they're running red
But now I've got the running gun blues




Rupert The Riley

 

Who'll ride in my Rupert the Riley?
Ride on for mile after miley
I'm the greatest driver, sit by my side
I'll drive you so wild, if you sit by my side
See how far we travel take hold the wheel
She'll drive us to hell
If you take hold the wheel
Wo-wo-wo-woo, yea-yea-yea-yeah
Toot beep-beep, beep beep
Toot beep-beep, beep beep

Who'll ride in my Rupert the Riley?
Ride on for mile after miley

Tiger tiger brightly Riley of mine
She's shaky on her legs, take that Riley of mine
I'm the greatest driver, sit by my side
I'll drive you so wild, if you sit by my side

Toot beep-beep, beep beep
Toot beep-beep, beep beep

(repeat 4 times)
Who'll ride in my Rupert the Riley?
Ride on for mile after miley




Sabotage

(??)




(Performed live during 'The First Concert Of The Eighties' with Steve Reich and Philip Glass at Carnegie Hall, New York, USA in March 1979. David played viola).





Sacrifice Yourself

(David Bowie/Tony Sales/Hunt Sales)

Some days he feels so empty
Just a talking head
Married to a Klingon
Who could cream him in the press

God could detonate him
God's the one we pick to curse us
Twenty-five years pass him
Like an evening at the circus

CHORUS
  Don't sacrifice yourself
  Don't sacrifice yourself
  Surprise yourself
  Don't sacrifice yourself
  Don't sacrifice yourself
  Don't sacrifice yourself

There it is, the look, the winner you once talked of being
Give her one last kiss and
Dive right out the window screaming
No truth decent, it was Summer from the waist down
She blew the shoes right off your feet
And tells you she's God's Grammy

CHORUS

Her, the only game in town, a queen of confidence
Blind in front of mirrors, proving nothings says a lot
Wham bam thank you Charlie
Vanity is all
You wander lonely to the scene
A crawling up the walls
Don't sacrifice yourself

(Recorded for The Rugrats movie soundtrack but not used. Rewritten and re-recorded as 'Safe' for Heathen album. Released as bonus track on CD single Everyone Says Hi).





Safe

(Lyrics: David Bowie. Music: David Bowie and Reeves Gabrels)

Frozen to the glass again
Out of our skins again
Cold I am
Tonight I am
Tomorrow's really on my mind

Sure to pick up from now on
The things will move more slowly
But thin is thin and chances slim
And sometimes we all have those dreams

Safe in this skylife
Safe, whoa whoa whoa whoa, whoa whoa
Safe in this skylife
Safe, whoa whoa whoa whoa, whoa whoa
In this skylife

The past it almost shimmers now
All we needed
All we wished for
But here I am
And safe am I
Trusting in the endless sky

Safe in this skylife
Safe, whoa whoa whoa whoa, whoa whoa
Safe in this skylife
Safe, whoa whoa whoa whoa, whoa whoa
In this skylife
Skylife
Skylife
Skylife

Are things getting better now?
Are things getting worse?
But I'm standing in the sunshine
And it lifts my heart and feeds my mind

Safe in this skylife
Safe, whoa whoa whoa whoa, whoa whoa
Safe in this skylife
Safe, whoa whoa whoa whoa, whoa whoa
In this skylife
Skylife
Skylife
Skylife
Skylife
Skylife
Skylife




Saviour

(Lyrics: Kristeen Young)

(Kristeen Young)
Baby come inside
Take off your coat
You're just a big fat mess
You're just an American landfill, landfill

 
Can you leave it all behind?
Can you get to what you feel?
Do you need the jaws of life
To cut through the American landfill, landfill?

(Both)
We could rise up from this grave
  You could be my saviour
We could prepare to ascend
  You could be my saviour
We could walk on water
  You could be my saviour
You could be my saviour, saviour

 
Can you just not wear that dress?
Can you just not get your hair cut like that?
Who picks out your clothes?
Sort through the American landfill, landfill

(Both)
We could rise up from this grave
  You could be my saviour
We could prepare to ascend
  You could be my saviour
We could walk on water
  You could be my saviour
I would be your saviour, saviour

We could rise up from this grave
  You could be my saviour
We could prepare to ascend
  You could be my saviour
We could walk on water
  You could be my saviour
Be my reciprocal saviour

(Kristeen Young)
Are you having trouble breathing?
Did you find it hard to breathe?
Did you wake up to find you're buried, semi-alive?
Ah!!! Do you need a hand to dig the American landfill, landfill?


(Appears on the Kristeen Young album 'Breasticles' released on N_Records in Lisbon, Portugal. Produced by Tony Visconti).





Saviour Machine

 

President Joe once had a dream
The world held his hand, gave their pledge
So he told them his scheme for a Saviour Machine

They called it the Prayer, its answer was law
Its logic stopped war, gave them food
How they adored till it cried in its boredom

'Please don't believe in me, please disagree with me
Life is too easy, a plague seems quite feasible now
Or maybe a war, or I may kill you all

Don't let me stay, don't let me stay
My logic says burn so send me away
Your minds are too green, I despise all I've seen
You can't stake your lives on a Saviour Machine

I need you flying, and I'll show that dying
Is living beyond reason, sacred dimension of time
I perceive every sign, I can steal every mind

Don't let me stay, don't let me stay
My logic says burn so send me away
Your minds are too green, I despise all I've seen
You can't stake your lives on a Saviour Machine




Scary Monsters (And Super Creeps)

 

She had an horror of rooms she was tired you can't hide beat
When I looked in her eyes they were blue but nobody home
Well she could've been a killer if she didn't walk the way she do, and she do
She opened strange doors that we'd never close again

She began to wail jealousies scream
Waiting at the light know what I mean?

CHORUS (twice)
  Scary monsters, super creeps
  Keep me running, running scared

She asked me to stay and I stole her room
She asked for my love and I gave her a dangerous mind
Now she's stupid in the street and she can't socialise
Well I love the little girl and I'll love her till the day she dies

She wails
Jimmy's guitar sound jealousies scream
Waiting at the light know what I mean

CHORUS (twice)

CHORUS (twice)

Oh oh woh-oh
Oh, oh-oh-oh oh
Oh oh oh, oh oh




Scream Like A Baby

 

Well I wouldn't buy no merchandise
And I wouldn't go to war
And I mixed with other colours
But the nurse doesn't care
And I hide under blankets
Or did I run away?
I really can't remember
Last time I saw the light of day

But I remember Sam 'cos he was like me

CHORUS
  Scream like a baby
  Sam was a gun
  And I never knew his last name
  And we never had no fun

Well they came down hard on the faggots
And they came down hard on the street
They came down harder on Sam
And they all knew he was beat
He was thrown into the wagon
Blindfolded, chains, and they stomped on us
And took away our clothes and things
And pumped us full of strange drugs
And oh I saw Sam falling
Spitting in their eyes
But now I lay me down to sleep
And now I close my eyes
Now I'm learning to be a part of socie... socie... sss

CHORUS

No athletic programme, no discipline, no book
He just sat in the back seat swearing he'd seek revenge
But he jumped into the furnace
Singing old songs we loved

CHORUS (twice)

(Originally derived from I Am A Laser).





Scream Like A Baby - (earlier version)

 

Well I wouldn't buy the merchandise
And I wouldn't fight no war
And I mixed with the other targets
But the nurse isn't soft
And I hide under blankets
Or did I run away?
I really can't remember
Last time I saw the light of day

But I remember Sam 'cos he was like me

CHORUS
  Scream like a baby
  Scream like a gun
  I never knew his last name
  We never had no fun

Well they came down hard on the faggots
And they came down hard on the street
They came down harder on Sam
And we all knew he was beat
He was thrown into the wagon
Blindfolded, chains, and stomped on us
They took away our clothes
And pumped us full of strange drugs
I saw Sam falling
Spitting in their eyes
But they laid me down to sleep
And now I close my eyes
'Cos I'm learning to be an integrated part of society

CHORUS

No athletic programme, no discipline, no book
He just sat in the back suite swearing he'd seek revenge
But he jumped into the furnace
Singing old songs we loved

Sector Z

(Lyrics: Dave Gutter. Music: Gutter/McNaboe/Zoidis/Albee/Noyes/Roods/Ward)

Understand this
All the grown-ups produce communication
The Ava queen it's not a boom in the human nature
Home ? is all belongs
But in the smokey clubs you won't need oxygen and you won't need laser guns

We got reggae
We got raw
and a bullet from the core

We got surfing school
But not a surface with Avalon

(Are you listening?)
(Are you listening?)

(CHORUS)
  Is your volume up?  (is your volume up?)
  Is your power on?  (is the power on?)
  Do yourself a system at the speed of sound  (are you listening?)

  Which way does your antenna go?  (volume up)
  On your radio  (power on)
  This is rock 'n' roll  (this is rock 'n' roll)

At the show, get up, get ready to go
I know our planets cold at night
But just step inside the door
'Cos our satellites we try to light the sun
When all the lights going on, we're off, get up,
And when they're off we'll go home

On your planet you don't have rock 'n' roll
You don't have radio
You don't have disco lights
And you don't have Rubber Soul

(Are you listening?)
(Are you listening?)

(CHORUS x2)
  Is your volume up?  (is your volume up?)
  Is your power on?  (is the power on?)
  Do yourself a system at the speed of sound  (are you listening?)

  Which way does your antenna go?  (volume up)
  On your radio  (power on)
  This is rock 'n' roll  (this is rock 'n' roll)

"My children and parents listen to me well. You must not allow your children to recordings known as rock n' roll."





See Emily Play

(Syd Barrett)

Emily tries but misunderstands
She's often inclined to borrow somebody's dreams 'til tomorrow

CHORUS
  There is no other day
  Let's try it another way
  You'll lose your mind and play
  Free games for May
  See Emily play

Soon after dark, Emily cries
Gazing at trees in sorrow hardly a sound 'til tomorrow

CHORUS

Put on a gown that touches the ground
Float on a river for ever and ever
Emily

CHORUS




See Saw

(Claude Sutton/Howie Pratt/Rup Davies)

Your love is like a see-saw, baby, see-saw
Your love is like a see-saw, baby, see-saw
First it's up and then it's down
It changes so fast, it never hits the ground
It goes up, down and up, like a see-saw

When you said you'd been my baby, see-saw
When you said you'd been my baby, see-saw
I thought your love was sincere
But at this rate, it won't last a year
It goes up, down and up, like a see-saw

Monday, it's a-huggin' and a-kissin'
Tuesday, something I've been missin'
Wednesday, everything is fine
Thursday, you done changed your mind
Friday, it's the day we make up
Saturday, the day we break up
Sunday, things are going all right
Monday, you want to start up fightin'

Your love is like a see-saw, baby, see-saw
Your love is like a see-saw, baby, see-saw
First you're glad and then you're mad
You're the strangest girl I ever had
It goes up, down and up, like a see-saw

(Cover version of The Moonglows hit performed live by David Bowie and The Buzz).





Sell Me A Coat

 

La la la la la la, la la la la la la la

A winter's day, a bitter snowflake on my face
My summer girl takes little backward steps away
Jack Frost took her hand and left me, Jack Frost ain't so cool

CHORUS
  Sell me a coat with buttons of silver
  Sell me a coat that's red or gold
  Sell me a coat with little patch pockets
  Sell me a coat 'cos I feel cold

And when she smiles, the ice forgets to melt away
Not like before, her smile was warm in yesterday
See the trees like silver candy, feel my icy hand

CHORUS

See my eyes, my window pane
See my tears like gentle rain
That's the memory of a summer day

CHORUS (twice)

La la la la la la (repeat)

Seven

(David Bowie/Reeves Gabrels

I forgot what my father said
I forgot what he said
I forgot what my mother said
As we lay upon your bed

A city full of flowers
A city full of rain

I got seven days to live my life
Or seven ways to die

I forgot what my brother said
I forgot what he said
I don't regret anything at all
I remember how we wept

On a bridge of violent people
I was small enough to cry
I got seven days to live my life
Or seven ways to die

Hold my face before you
Still my trembling heart
Seven days to live my life
Or seven ways to die

The Gods forgot they made me
So I forget them too
I listen to the shadows
I play among their graves

My heart was never broken
My patience never tried
I got seven days to live my life
Or seven ways to die

Seven days to live my life
Or seven ways to die

Seven (repeat ad lib)




Seven Years In Tibet

(Lyrics: David Bowie. Music: David Bowie/Reeves Gabrels)

"Are you OK?
You've been shot in the head
And I'm holding your brains"
The old woman said
So I drink in the shadows
Of an evening sky
See nothing at all

The stars look so special
And the snow looks so old
The frail form is drifting
Beyond the ochre-zone
Turn to question the mountain
Why pigs can fly
It's nothing at all

I praise to you
Nothing ever goes away
I praise to you
Nothing ever goes
I praise to you

I praise to you
Nothing ever goes away
I praise to you
Nothing ever goes
I praise to you
Nothing ever goes away
I praise to you
Nothing ever goes, nothing ever goes
Nothing

(Derived from an instrumental piece entitled Brussels).





Sex And The Church

The union of Christ and his bride

It's all very puzzling

Sex and the church
Sex and the church
Sex and the church
And the church... and the church

All the great mystic religions
Put strong emphasis, on
The redeeming spiritual qualities
Of sex... of sex
Christianity
Has been pretty modern
About sex

Of sex
Of sex
Of sex
Of sex
Sex and the church
Sex and the church
Sex and the church
Sex... sex

I think there is a union
Between the flesh and the spirit
Sex and the church
Sex and the church

All religions' mother (spoken)

VERSE (twice)
  Give me the freedom of spirit
  And the joys of the flesh
  And sex... sex...
  Sex and the church

CHORUS (twice)
  Sex and the church
  Sex and the church
  Sex and the church
  And the church... and the church
  Sex
  Sex
  Sex and the church
  Sex and the church
  Sex and the church
  Sex... sex...

Sex

Sex and the church
Sex and the church
Sex and the church
Sex... sex
I love you.




Shades

(Iggy Pop/David Bowie)

You gave me a present
The paper was blue and green
I unwrapped it with pleasure
These are the best shades I've ever seen
You can be my girlfriend
Forever and a day
I never thought I was worth much
Or that anyone would treat me this way

I'm not
The kind of guy
Who dresses like a king
And a really fine pair of shades
Means everything
And the light that blinds my eyes
Shines from you

It makes me come in the night
It makes me swim with delight
I like this pain
I like this mirror
I like these shades

I could have had a problem
I might have never followed through
The other guys are in trouble
They wouldn't listen to a girl like you
These shades say something
I'll bet they cost a lot
I hope I don't break 'em
I hope we don't break up

I'm not
The kind of guy
Who dresses like a king
And a really fine pair of shades
Means everything
And the light that blinds my eyes
Shines from you

It makes me come in the night
It makes me swim with delight
I like this pain
I like this mirror
I like these shades

I like these shades
I like these shades




Shadow Man (demo version)

 

There's a man back a-ways
Who believes at where he is
And there's a girl
Up ahead who says she knows

And the street overflows
With the folk who understand
But for the guy who can't be seen

He's the Shadow Man
And the Shadow Man is close at hand

Take a turn and see his smile
Made of nothing but loneliness
Just take a walk and be a friend
To the Shadow Man

You can call him Joe, you can call him Sam
You should call and see who answers
For he promises to come running, guided by the truth
For the Shadow Man is really you

Look in his eyes and see your reflection
Look to the stars and see his eyes
He'll show you tomorrow, he'll show you the sorrows
Of what you did today

You can call him foe, you can call him friend
You should call and see who answers
For he knows your eyes are drawn
To the road ahead
And the Shadow Man is waiting round the bend
Oh, Shadow Man
Shadow Man, Shadow Man
It's really you, it's really you, it's really you
He's the Shadow Man

(Shadow Man appeared on a reel-to-reel tape dated 5.6.76. Recorded at Gooseberry Sound Studos, 19 Gerrard Street, London W1. Producer was John Shipcott. There were three versions of Shadow Man (complete, vocal only and full vocal with half backing track), Cyclops and The Invader. The tape was auctioned at Sotheby's in 1990).

Shake It

 

  (Shake it, shake it - what's my line)
  (Shake it, shake it - what's my line)

I feel like a sail-boat
Adrift on the sea
It's a brand new day
So when you gonna phone me?

  (Shake it, shake it - what's my line)

I could take you to heaven
I could spin you to hell
Or take you to New York
It's the place that I know well

  (Shake it, shake it - what's my line)

Sitting on a flagstone talking to a faceless girl
  (Shake it, shake it - what's my line)
And I'm wondering what to say but my eyes do the talking so well

Duck and I sway - (what's my line)
I shoot at a full moon - (what's my line)
So what's my line - shake it, shake it baby
Shake it, shake it ooh

'Cos love is the answer
Love's talking to me
I'd scream and I'll fight for you
You're better than money

  (Shake it, shake it - what's my line)

We're the kind of people who can shake it if we're feeling blue
  (Shake it, shake it - what's my line)
When I'm feeling disconnected well I sure know what to do
  (Shake it, shake it - what's my line)
Shake it baby, well shake it, shake it

I duck and I sway - (what's my line)
I shoot at a full moon - (what's my line)
So what's my line
Shake it, shake it baby
Shake it, shake it, ooh
  (Shake it, shake it - what's my line)
Shake it baby
Shake it, shake it
  (Shake it, shake it - what's my line)
Shake it baby, shake it, shake it
  (Shake it, shake it - what's my line)




Shakin' All Over

(Heath)

When you're movin' right up close to me
That's when I get the chills all over me
Quivers down my back bone
I get the shakes in my thigh bone
I've got the shivers in my knee bone
Shakin' all over

Just the way that you say goodnight to me
Brings that feeling all inside of me
Quivers down my back bone
I get the shakes in my thigh bone
I've got the shivers in my knee bone
Shakin' all over

Quivers down my back bone
I get the shakes in my thigh bone
I've got the shivers in my knee bone
Shakin' all over

You make me shake and, I like it baby
You make me shake and, I like it baby
Oh, shake, shake, shake, shake...




Shapes Of Things

(Paul Samwell-Smith/Jim McCarty/Keith Relf)

Shapes of things before my eyes
Just teach me to despise
Will time make man more wise
Here within my lonely frame
My eyes just hurt my brain
But will it seem the same

CHORUS
  (Come tomorrow), will I be older
  (Come tomorrow), maybe a soldier
  (Come tomorrow), may I be bolder than today

Now the trees are almost green
But will they still be seen
When time and tide have been
Boy into your passing hands
Please don't destroy these lands
Don't make them desert sands

CHORUS

Soon I hope that I will find
A seed within my mind
That won't disgrace my kind




She Shook Me Cold

 

We met upon a hill, the night was cool and still
She sucked my dormant will
Mother, she blew my brain, I will go back again
My God, she shook me cold

I had no time to spare, I grabbed her golden hair
And threw her to the ground
Father, she craved my head, Oh Lord, the things she said
My God, she should be told

I was very smart, broke the gentle hearts
Of many young virgins
I was quick on the ball, left them so lonely
They'd just give up trying
Then she took my head, smashed it up
Kept my young blood rising
Crushed me mercilessly, kept me going around
So she didn't know I crave her so-o-o

I'll give my love in vain, to reach that peak again
We met upon a hill
Mother, she blew my brain, I will go back again
My God, she shook me cold




She's Got Medals

 

She'd walk through the door and she'd set up the drinks on the house
She played a good game of darts, and the men slapped her back
And never took her out
She wore a trench coat khaki
Her hobnail boots were full of holes
  She's got medals

Her mother called her Mary, but she changed her name to Tommy, she's a one, oh
She went and joined the Army, passed the medical
Don't ask me how it's done
They sent her to the front line
Fighting for her country's name
  She's got medals

She got very tired of picking up girls
Cleaning her gun and shaving her curls
Then the enemy dropped a bomb
Survivors there were none

People say that when the moon is full and all the stars have gone to bed
You can see her ghost but that's a lie because the naughty woman isn't dead
She deserted on the previous morning
Replaced her uniform with dresses silk and green
Called herself Eileen
Came to London Town
Now she's settled down
  She's got medals




Shilling The Rubes

 

Lay in the corner
How long have you been awake?
You lay out your life
How much did he take?
Never counting the change
Fast into another

It's only a ferris wheel
It's only a house of fear
It's only a three-ring circus
Ringmaster, cannonball
Never counting the change
Fast into another
Now he's gone

Gone - the day that he left town
Gone - he was shilling the rubes
Gone - let the tears of a clown
And he's gone
He was shilling the rubes

Fifteen new faces
Fifteen new days
Still won't forget him
Hot boiling craze
Never counting the change
He passed into another
Now he's gone

Gone - the day that he left town
Gone - he was shilling the rubes
Gone - let the tears of a clown
And he's gone
He was shilling the rubes

Gone - the day that he left town
Gone - he was shilling the rubes
Yeah gone - let the tears of a clown
Oh, he was shilling the rubes

(Believed originally intended for David's proposed 1973 stage version of 'Nineteen Eighty-Four' which was aborted after George Orwell's widow Sonia Blair refused permission. Also recorded during the Young Americans sessions on 13th August 1974 at the Sigma Sound Studios in Philadelphia, USA).





Shining Star (Makin' My Love)

 

Eddie boy lit like paraffin spending two weeks in a crack house
Burns on his brain like Chernobyl

Dean was seen with a two bag purchase
He was lying dead on his mother's bed
Someone for pray for - till I met you

Life is like a broken arrow - memory a swingin' door
I could be your great misfortune - I can make you happy every day of your life
Makin' my love like a shining star - takin' my love just a touch too far

Tessie turns tricks with a soul like ice 'cos love left holes
And four swell kids breaking her heart
I've got windows, I've seen much vice, I've touched down with vermin, cowardice, lice
And I say

Nobody cares what you do - please be yourself to death
I could be your great misfortune
Bet you'll never find a, bet you'll never find a better man
Makin' my love like a shining star
Taking my love just a touch too far

Peter met Frank formed a dummy run gang
Worked heist or hit for 10 g's flat
Blew heads outta shape in the name of Trotsky, Sinn Féin, Hitler cashdown
No hope heroes cover this page with debts in hell
And fingers in blood
Poor little bodies all covered in scabs threw it all away
Another life in the grave
Another life in the grave

Life is like a broken arrow - memory a swingin' door
I could be your great misfortune
Well I could make you happy every goddamn single day of your life

Makin' my love like a shining star
Like a shining star
Hey that's what you are
Like a shining star

Makin' my love like a shining star
Taking my love
Just a touch too far

Makin' my love like a shining star
Like a shining star
Taking my love
Makin' my love
Just a touch too far
Makin' my love like a shining star
Like a shining star
Taking my love
Just a touch too far
Makin' my love like a shining star
Taking my love
Just a touch too far
Makin' my love like a shining star
Taking my love
Just a touch too far




Shock For One

(David Bowie/Reeves Gabrels/Tony Sales/Hunt Sales)

 




Shopping For Girls

(David Bowie/Reeves Gabrels

Between the dead ring ash of extreme defence
The lonely groups of company boys
Snapping pictures of scrawny limbs and toothy grins
These are children riding naked on their tourist pals
While the hollows that pass for eyes swell from withdrawal
And he lies on a mattress in a rat infested room
Talking 'bout his family and the cold back home

CHORUS
  Between the dull cold eyes and the mind unstable
  No one over here reads the papers pal
  'Tween the dull cold eyes and the mind unstable
  He's a clean trick and he's shopping for girls

A small black someone jumps over the crazy white guard
Cranking up the volume of a Michael Jackson song

CHORUS

Where the Frangipani scents the air
She mouths a word that breaks his stare
He grunts his reply in a garrulous croak
"That's a mighty big word for a nine year old"

CHORUS

Shopping for girls, shopping for girls

You gaze down into her eyes for a million miles
You wanna give her a name and a clean rag doll




Shrinking Jimmy

(Emm Gryner/Holly Palmer/David Bowie/Mark Plati/Campbell/Garson/Dorsey/Hamilton)

Jimmy shrink that shirt again tonight
'Cos you know how much I love it when it's tight
Jimmy, Jimmy, shrink the shirt again!
Shrink that shirt again
Let's just be friends
(Shrink it one time)
Shrink that shirt again
Let's just be friends now Jimmy
You know how much I loved that shirt
And you know how much I love you
I miss you so much Jimmy
But when you're not here
I put that shirt on
And when I put that shirt on
And it stretches so tight across my nipples
I feel you Jimmy
You're here with me
Come back Jimmy
Come back...




Silly Boy Blue

 

Mountains of Lhasa are feeling the rain
People are walking the Potala lanes
Preacher takes the school
One boy breaks a rule
Silly Boy Blue, Blue, Silly Boy Blue

Yak butter statues that melt in the sun
Cannot dissolve all the work you've not done
A Chela likes to feel
That his overself pays the bill
Silly Boy Blue, Blue, Silly Boy Blue

You wish and wish, and wish again
You've tried so hard to fly
You'll never leave your body now
You've got to wait to die

La la la la la la la la la la (x2)
La la la la la (x2)
Silly Boy Blue, Blue, Silly Boy Blue

Child of Tibet, you're a gift from the sun
Reincarnation of one better man
The homeward road is long
You've left your prayers and song
Silly Boy Blue, Blue, Silly Boy Blue
Silly Boy Blue, Silly Boy Blue





Silly Boy Blue - (1965 demo)

 

Tabletop mountain is feeling the rain
People are walking down Forest Bridge Lane
A padre takes the school
One boy breaks a rule
Silly Boy Blue, Blue

Fir cones lie heavy like gold in your hand
Feeling the soft dirt, it wrinkles like sand
One boy cried that day
Another ran away
Silly Boy Blue, Blue

I wish I wish, I wish again
I had not run away
But maybe soon I'll go back home again
They'll take me in again
They'll take me

La la la la la la la la la la (x2)
La la la la la (x2)
Silly Boy Blue, Blue

Memories I've seen are all dark in the past
Feeling him growing and ageing so fast
I've got the mail today
Oh, someone's passed away
Silly Boy Blue, Blue, Silly Boy Blue
Ooh Silly Boy Blue
Ooh Silly Boy Blue

(Appeared on an Oak label acetate, recorded October 1965 at R.G. Jones Studios, Morden, Surrey).

Silver Tree Top School For Boys

 

Here's the town in which I live, Petunia Green
Here's the shop and here's the man who sold me laces for my shoes
There is Mr. Marcus Bowles they say he's mad
'Here's the battle that I won' at
Silver Tree Top School for Boys

Pearly days were good as gold
An apple here an apple there
And everywhere a 'Yes Sir', 'No Sir'
They made me roll the cricket pitch once a day
I've never been so happy than at
Silver Tree Top School for Boys

The mowing machine was leaving small piles of grass
The wind had blown some blades into the pipe of Mr. Marcus Bowles
This manic teacher fell upon the cricket field
Smiling, laughing, rolling about at Silver Tree Top School for Boys

"Hey there" they call in the staff room
They call in the canteen "Hey come and look at what I found"
A thousand boys and Masters sitting
On the cricket ground at
Silver Tree Top School for Boys

The English master thought he was a purple mouse
And the Head, who's usually sad, was swinging from a tree
Mr. Brown the Physics man is off his head
And everyone just loves the grass at
Silver Tree Top School for Boys

La la lalalalalalalalala lalalalalalalala lalalalalalalalala lalalalalalalalala




Sister Midnight

(Iggy Pop/David Bowie/Carlos Alomar)

Calling Sister Midnight
You've got me reaching for the moon
Calling Sister Midnight
You've got me playing the fool
Calling Sister Midnight

Calling Sister Midnight
Can you hear me call
Can you hear me well
Can you hear me at all
Calling Sister Midnight
I'm an Idiot for you
Calling Sister Midnight
I'm a breakage inside
Calling Sister Midnight
Calling Sister Midnight
You know I had a dream last night
Mother was in my bed
And I made love to her
Father he gunned for me
Hunted me with his six gun
Calling Sister Midnight
What can I do about my dreams

Listen to me Sister Midnight
You put a beggar in my heart
Calling Sister Midnight
You've got me walking in rags
Hey where are you Sister Midnight
Can you hear me call
Can you hear me well
Can you hear me at all




Sixteen

(Iggy Pop)

Sweet sixteen in leather boots
Body and soul I go crazy
Baby Baby I'm hungry
Sweet sixteen
Funky bar all full of faces
Pretty faces beautiful faces
Body and soul
Body and soul
I give to you
I'm an easy mark
With my broken heart
Sweet sixteen
Show you my explosion
Sweet sixteen

Go out to the funky bar
I get hurt - crying inside
'Cos
Everybody's so fine and - and they
Don't need me
Tell me what can I do -
Sweet sixteen
I give you my body and soul
Sweet sixteen

I must be hungry
'Cos I go crazy
Over your leather boots
Now baby I know
That's not normal
But I love you
I love you
I love you
Sweet sixteen




Slip Away

 

Oogie waits for just another day
Drags his bones to see the Yankees play
Bones Boy talks and flickers grey
Oh, they slip away

Once a time they nearly might have been
Bones and Oogie on a silver screen
No one knew what they could do
Except for me and you
They slip away
They slip away

(Chorus)
Don't forget to keep your head warm
Twinkle twinkle Uncle Floyd
Watching all the world and war torn
How I wonder where you are
Ohhh-oo
Sailing over Coney Island
Twinkle twinkle Uncle Floyd
We were dumb but you were fun, boy
How I wonder where you are

Oogie knew there's never ever time
Some of us will always stay behind
Down in space it's always 1982
The joke we always knew
Oo-oo
What'sa matter with you?

C'mon, let's go
Slip away
Oo-o

(Chorus)




Slow Burn

 

Here shall we live in this terrible town
Where the price for our eyes shall squeeze them tight like a fist
And the walls shall have eyes
And the doors shall have ears
But we'll dance in the dark
And they'll play with their lives

Like a slow burn
Leading us on and on and on
Like a slow burn
Turning us round and round and round
But who are we?
So small in times such as these

Slow burn
Slow burn

Oh, these are the days
These are the strangest of all
These are the nights
These are the darkest to fall
But who knows?
Echoes in tenement halls
But who knows?
Though the years slay them all

Like a slow burn
Leading us on and on and on
Like a slow burn
Twirling us round and round and upside down

There's fear overhead
There's fear overground

Slow burn
Slow burn

Like a slow burn
Leading us on and on and on
Like a slow burn
Turning us round and round and round

And here are we
At the centre of it all

Slow burn
Slow burn
Slow burn




So Near To Loving You

 

 

(Song written by David when he was in The Manish Boys in 1964 or 1965).





Some Are



Sailors in snow
Send a callout raising hands
Some are bound to fail
Some are winter sun, ahhh

Sailors in snow
Send a callout raising hands
Some are bound to fail
Some are winter sun, ahhh

(Recorded during the Low sessions at The Chateau, Paris, France and Hansa Tonstudio, Berlin, Germany in 1976-1977).





Some Weird Sin

(Lyrics: Iggy Pop. Music: David Bowie)

I never got my
License to live
They won't give it up
So I stand at the world's edge
I'm trying to break in
Oh I know it's not for me
And the sight of it all
Makes me sad and ill
That's when I want
Some weird sin

Things get too straight
I can't bear it
I feel stuck
Stuck on a pin
I'm trying to break in
Oh I know it's not for me
And the sight of it all
Makes me sad and ill
That's when I want
Some weird sin
That's when I want
Some weird sin
Just to relax with
Yeah, some dumb weird sin
For a while anyway
With my head on the ledge
That's what you get
Out on the edge
Some weird sin

Things get too straight
I can't bear it
I feel stuck
Stuck on a pin
I'm trying to break in
Oh I know it's not for me
And the sight of it all
Makes me sad and ill
That's when I want
Some weird sin
That's when I want
Some weird sin
Just to relax with
Yeah, some dumb weird sin
For a while anyway
With my head on the ledge
That's what you get
Out on the edge
Some weird sin
Some weird sin
Some weird sin




Somebody Up There Likes Me

 

He...

He's everybody's token, on everybody's wall
Blessing all the papers, thanking one and all
Hugging all the babies, kissing all the ladies
Knowing all that you think about from writing on the wall

CHORUS 1
  He's so divine, his soul shines
  Breaks the night, sleep tight
  His ever loving face smiles on the whole human race
  He says "I'm somebody"

CHORUS 2
  He's got his eye on your soul, his hand on your heart
  He says "Don't hurry baby
  Somebody up there (somebody) likes me"

He's the savage son of the TV tube
Planets wrote the day was due
All the wisest men around
Predicted that a man was found
Who looked a lot like you and me, yeah
Everyone with sense could see
Nothing left his eye unmoved, he
Had the plan, he had to use

CHORUS 1 and 2

Somebody plays my song in tune
Makes me, makes me, makes me stronger for you, babe
Was a way when we were young
That any man was judged by what he'd done
But now you pick them on the screen
What they look like, where they've been

CHORUS 2

Leaders come, they hate all the people
That given time the leaders go
Tell me, can they hold you under their spell
Or can they walk and hold you as well, as a smile like Valentino?
Could he sell you anything?

Keep your eye on your soul, keep your hand on your heart
"Don't hurry, baby
Somebody up there (somebody) likes me"

  (somebody, somebody, somebody)
  (somebody, somebody, somebody, somebody, somebody, somebody)
Somebody (somebody) somebody (somebody) somebody (somebody, somebody)
Somebody (somebody) somebody (somebody) somebody (somebody, somebody)
Yeah, can't remember (somebody) peace so well
Oh, space to ramble, (somebody, somebody) space to boogie

Soul shine (Ooh-ooh)
So divine
Somebody (ooh-ooh, somebody)

Soul shine (Ooh-ooh)
So divine
Somebody (ooh-ooh)

Somebody, somebody, somebody
(Ad-lib)




Something Happens

(Colin Blunstone)

(Also referred to as 'Something')

 

(Supposedly an outtake from 1971 which appeared on the Starman Over The Rainbow bootleg. In 2008 it was finally exposed as a fake - 'Something Happens When You Touch Me' was written and performed by Colin Blunstone and officially released in 1995 on Live In Concert At The BBC).





Something In The Air

(Lyrics: David Bowie. Music: David Bowie/Reeves Gabrels)

Your coat and hat are gone
I really can't look at your little empty shelf
A ragged teddy bear
It feels like we never had a chance
Don't look me in the eye

We lay in each other's arms
But the room is just an empty space
I guess we lived it out
Something in the air
We smile too fast
Then can't think of a thing to say

Lived with the best times
Left with the worst
I've danced with you too long
Nothing left to save

Let's take what we can
I know you'll hold your head up high
We've raged for the last time
A place of no return

And there's something in the air
Something in my eye
I've danced with you too long
Yeah
Something in the air
Something in my eye

Abracadoo, I lose you
We can't avoid the clash, the big mistake
Now we're gonna pay and pay
The sentence of our lives
Can't believe I'm asking you to go

We used what we could
To get the things we want
But we lost each other on the way
I guess you know I never wanted anyone more than you

Lived all our best times
Left with the worst
I've danced with you too long
Say what you will
There's something in the air

We've raged for the last time
But I know you'll hold your head up high
There's nothing we have to say
There's nothing in our eyes

But there's something in the air
Something in my eye
I've danced with you too long
There's something I have to say
There's something in the air
Something in my eye

I've danced with you too long
Danced with you too long
Danced with you too long
And there's something in the air
Something in the air




Song For Bob Dylan

 

Now hear this Robert Zimmerman
I wrote a song for you
About a strange young man called Dylan
With a voice like sand and glue
His words of truthful vengeance
They could pin us to the floor
Brought a few more people on
And put the fear in a whole lot more

Ah, here she comes
Here she comes
Here she comes again
The same old painted lady
From the brow of the superbrain
She'll scratch this world to pieces
As she comes on like a friend
Couple of songs
From your old scrapbook
Could send her home again

Gave your heart to every bedsit room
At least a picture on the wall
And you sat behind a million pair of eyes
And told them how they saw
Then she lost your train of thought
The paintings are all your own
While troubles are rising
We'd rather be scared
Together than alone

Ah, here she comes
Here she comes
Here she comes again
Same old painted lady
From the brow of the superbrain
She'll scratch this world to pieces
As she comes on like a friend
But a couple of songs
From your old scrapbook
Could send her home again - ahh

Now hear this Robert Zimmerman
Though I don't suppose we'll meet
Ask your good friend Dylan
If he, he's wild down the old street
Tell him we've lost his poems
So we're writing on the walls
Give us back our unity, an'
Give us back our family
You're every nation's refugee
Don't leave us with their sanity

Ah, here she comes
Here she comes
Here she comes again
The same old painted lady
From the brow of the superbrain
She'll scratch this world to pieces
As she comes on like a friend
But a couple of songs
From your old scrapbook
Could send her home again

Oh a couple of songs
From your old scrapbook
Could send her home again
Oh, here she comes, ooh here she comes
Yeah, here she comes




Sons Of The Silent Age

 

Sons of the silent age
Stand on platforms blank looks and no books
Sit in back rows of city limits
Lay in bed coming and going on easy terms
Sons of the silent age
Pace their rooms like a cell's dimensions
Rise for a year or two then make war
Search through their one inch thoughts
Then decide it couldn't be done

Baby, I'll never let you go
All I see is all I know
Let's find another way down (sons of sound and sons of sound)
Baby, baby, I'll never let you down
I can't stand another sound
Let's take another way in (sons of sound and sons of sound)

Sons of the silent age
Listen to tracks by Sam Therapy and King Dice
Sons of the silent age
Pick up in bars and cry only once
Sons of the silent age
Make love only once but dream and dream
They don't walk, they just glide in and out of life
They never die, they just go to sleep one day

Baby, I won't ever let you go
All I see is all I know
Let's take another way down (sons of sound and sons of sound)
Oh baby, baby, baby, I won't ever let you down
I can't stand another sound
Let's find another way in (sons of sound and sons of sound)
(Sons of sound and sons of sound)
Baby, baby, baby, fire away!

(Recorded during the "Heroes" sessions at Hansa Tonstudio, Berlin, Germany in 1977).





Sorrow

(Feldman/Goldstein/Gottehrer)

With your long blonde hair and your eyes of blue
The only thing I ever got from you was sorrow
Sorrow
You acted funny trying to spend my money
You're out there playing your high class games of sorrow
Sorrow

You never do what you know you oughta
Something tells me you're a Devil's daughter
Sorrow, sorrow
Ahhhh, ah, ahhhh

I tried to find her
'Cos I can't resist her (I tried to find her)
I never knew just how much I missed her
Sorrow
Sorrow

With your long blonde hair and your eyes of blue
The only thing I ever got from you was sorrow
Sorrow
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh

With your long blonde hair
I couldn't sleep last night
With your long blonde hair




Sorry

(Hunt Sales)

Time is tight love always gets in the way
I'm sorry

Didn't mean to hurt you but I always do
I'm sorry
I'm so sorry

I'm so sorry
I'm sorry
You know I am

Well my eyes are pinned and my money's spent
I'm sorry
You know I'm sorry
I wouldn't do for me what I would for for you
Would you forgive me
I'm sorry
I'm so sorry

I guess I've thrown it away
I've thrown it away
Didn't mean to do it that way
I'm sorry
Time is so tight
And I mean it if I say
I'm so sorry
I didn't mean to hurt you
I'm sorry

I'm sorry
I'm sor-rrr-ry
You know I am




Soul Love

 

Stone love - she kneels before the grave
Her brave son - who gave his life to save the slogan
That hovers between the headstone and her eyes
For they penetrate her grieving

New love - a boy and girl are talking
New words - that only they can share in
New words - a love so strong it tears their hearts
To sleep - through the fleeting hours of morning
Love is careless in its choosing - sweeping over cross an' baby
Love descends on those defenseless
Idiot love will spark the fusion
Inspirations have I none - just to touch the flaming dove
All I have is my love of love - and love is not loving

Soul love - the priest that tastes the word and
Told of love - and how my God on high is
All love - though reaching up my loneliness evolves
By the blindness that surrounds him

Love is careless in its choosing - sweeping over cross an' baby
Love descends on those defenseless
Idiot love will spark the fusion
Inspirations have I none - just to touch the flaming dove
All I have is my love of love - and love is not loving




Soul Man

(Isaac Hayes/David Porter)

Coming to you, on a dusty road
Good loving, I got a truck load
And when you get it, you got something
Don't worry, 'cause I'm coming

I'm a soul man
I'm a soul man
I'm a soul man (come on!)
I'm a soul man

And that ain't all

Got what I got, the hard way
And I'll make it better, each and every day
So honey, I said don't you fret
'Cause you ain't seen nothing yet

I'm a soul man
I'm a soul man
I'm a soul man
I'm a soul man, oh

I was brought up on a side street, yes mam
I learned how to love before I could eat
I was educated at Woodstock
When I start loving, oh I can't stop

I'm a soul man
I'm a soul man
I'm a soul man (yeah!)
I'm a soul man

Just grab the rope and I'll pull you in
Give you hope and be your only boyfriend
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (yeah!)

I'm talking about a soul man
I'm a soul man
(And you're a) soul man
Soul man (oh Lord)
Soul man
(I'm a) soul man
(And you're a) soul man
(And you're a) soul man




Sound And Vision

 

Ahhh...
Ahhh...

Doo, doo, doo, doo, do-doh
Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, do-doh

Don't you wonder sometimes
'Bout sound and vision

Blue, blue, electric blue
That's the colour of my room
Where I will live
Blue, blue

Pale blinds drawn on day
Nothing to read, nothing to say
Blue, blue

I will sit right down, waiting for the gift of sound and vision
And I will sing, waiting for the gift of sound and vision
Drifting into my solitude, over my head

Don't you wonder sometimes
'Bout sound and vision

(Recorded during the Low sessions at The Chateau, Paris, France and Hansa Tonstudio, Berlin, Germany in 1976-1977).

Ground Control to Major Tom
Ground Control to Major Tom
Take your protein pills and put your helmet on

Commencing (five) countdown, engines on (four) (three) (two)
Check ignition (one) and may God's love (lift off) be with you

This is Ground Control to Major Tom
You've really made the grade
And the papers want to know whose shirts you wear
Now it's time to leave the capsule if you dare

    "This is Major Tom to Ground Control
    I'm stepping through the door
    And I'm floating in a most a peculiar way
    And the stars look very different today

    For here
    Am I sitting in a tin can
    Far above the world
    Planet Earth is blue
    And there's nothing I can do

    Though I'm past one hundred thousand miles
    I'm feeling very still
    And I think my spaceship knows which way to go
    Tell my wife I love her very much she knows"

Ground Control to Major Tom
Your circuit's dead, there's something wrong
Can you hear me, Major Tom?

Standing Next To You

(Marc Bolan/David Bowie)

(Spoken outro for Marc show):

"Thank you very much. David Bowie - the most amazing songs from his stunning smash but meanwhile personally until next series I hope you watch it forever. Till David comes back should be every year after - news in the world."

Get you down, yeah

Star

 

Tony went to fight in Belfast
Rudi stayed at home to starve
I could make it all worthwhile as a rock 'n' roll star
Bevan tried to change the nation
Sonny wants to turn the world, well he can tell you that he tried
I could make a transformation as a rock 'n' roll star
So inviting - so enticing to play the part
I could play the wild mutation as a rock 'n' roll star

Get it all yeah Oo yeah!
I could do with the money
I'm so wiped out with things as they are
I'd send my photograph to my honey - and I'd c'mon like a regular superstar

I could make a transformation as a rock 'n' roll star
So inviting - so enticing to play the part
I could play the wild mutation as a rock 'n' roll star

Get it all yeah
I could do with the money
I'm so wiped out with things as they are
I'd send my photograph to my honey - and I'd c'mon like a regular superstar

I could fall asleep at night as a rock 'n' roll star
I could fall in love all right as a rock 'n' roll star
Rock 'n' roll star
Rock 'n' roll star
(Spoken) "Just watch me now."




Starman

 

Hey now now, oh no no

Didn't know what time it was the lights were low oh-oh
I leaned back on my radio oh-oh
Some cat was layin' down some rock 'n' roll "lotta soul", he said
Then the loud sound did seem to fade
Came back like a slow voice on a wave of phase
That weren't no DJ that was hazy cosmic jive

(CHORUS)
There's a starman waiting in the sky
He'd like to come and meet us
But he thinks he'd blow our minds
There's a starman waiting in the sky
He's told us not to blow it
'Cos he knows it's all worthwhile
He told me:
"Let the children lose it
Let the children use it
Let all the children boogie"

I had to phone someone so I picked on you
Hey, that's far out so you heard him too?
Switch on the TV we may pick him up on Channel Two
Look out your window I can see his light
If we can sparkle he may land tonight
Don't tell your poppa or he'll get us locked up in fright

CHORUS (x2)

La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la (repeat)




Stateside

(David Bowie/Hunt Sales)

I'm going home
I've been gone much too long
She said she missed me
Since I been gone
I'll be back soon
Ain't no doubt
'Cos she said she wanted my loving, my loving

CHORUS (twice)
  No holding back I'm going home
  No holding back I'm going home
  I'm going Stateside with my convictions

I said I'm coming home soon
I don't know when
It will be sometime soon
Sooner than
I thought I'd be
I thought I'd be
I thought I'd be Stateside sooner than later

Marilyn inflatables home on the range
Where the living is easy on a horse with no name
Kennedy convertibles home on the range
Where the suffering comes easy on a blonde with no brain
I'm going Stateside
I'm going Stateside

I'm going home
It's been so long
She said she missed me
And all the fun we've had
I think it be the best way
She said she missed me in
Every, every way, so

CHORUS (twice)

I've been gone so long
I've been gone, I've been gone
I'm missing you

Marilyn inflatables home on the range
Where the living is easy on a horse with no name
Kennedy convertibles home on the range
Where the suffering comes easy on a ten dollar raise
I'm going Stateside
I'm going Stateside




Station To Station

 

The return of the Thin White Duke throwing darts in lovers' eyes
Here are we, one magical moment
Such is the stuff from where dreams are woven
Bending sound
Dredging the ocean, lost in my circle
Here am I
Flashing no colour, tall in this room overlooking the ocean
Here are we
One magical movement from Kether to Malkuth
There are you
Drive like a demon from station to station

The return of the Thin White Duke throwing darts in lovers' eyes
The return of the Thin White Duke throwing darts in lovers' eyes
The return of the Thin White Duke making sure white stains

Once there were mountains on mountains
And once there were sunbirds to soar with
And once I could never be down
Got to keep searching and searching
And oh what will I be believing and who will connect me with love?
Wonderful, wonderful, wonder when?
Have you sought fortune evasive and shy?
Drink to the men who protect you and I
Drink, drink, drain your glass
Raise your glass high

It's not the side effects of the Cocaine
I'm thinking that it must be love
It's too late - to be grateful
It's too late - to be late again
It's too late - to be hateful
The European canon is near

I must be only one in a million
I won't let the day pass without her
It's too late - to be grateful
It's too late - to be late again
It's too late - to be hateful
The European canon is here, yes he's here

Should I believe that I've been stricken?
Does my face show some kind of glow?
It's too late - to be grateful
It's too late - to be late again
It's too late - to be hateful
The European canon is here, yes he's here
It's too late, it's too late, it's too late, it's too late, it's too late
The European canon is near

Well it's not the side effects of the Cocaine
I'm thinking that it must be love
It's too late - to be grateful
It's too late - to be late again
It's too late - to be hateful
The European canon is near

I must be only one in a million
But I won't let the day pass without her
It's too late - to be grateful
It's too late - to be late again
It's too late - to be hateful
The European canon is near, yes he's here

Should I believe that I've been stricken?
Does my face show some kind of glow?
It's too late - to be grateful
It's too late - to be late again
It's too late - to be hateful
The European canon is near, yes he's near
It's too late, it's too late, it's too late, it's too late, it's too late 



Stay

 

This week dragged past me so slowly
The days fell on their knees
Maybe I'll take something to help me
Hope someone takes after me
I guess there's always some change in the weather
This time I know we could get it together
If I did casually mention tonight
That would be crazy tonight

Stay - that's what I meant to say or do something
But what I never say is stay this time
I really meant to so bad this time
'Cos you can never really tell when somebody
Wants something you want too

Heart-wrecker, heart-wrecker, make me delight
Night is so vague when it brings someone new
This time tomorrow I'll know what to do
I know it's happened to you

Stay - that's what I meant to say or do something
But what I never say is stay this time
I really meant to so bad this time

'Cos you can never really tell when somebody
Wants so much to stay
That's what I meant to say or do something
But what I never say is stay this time
I really meant to so bad this time
'Cos you can never really tell when somebody
Wants something you want too




Stay (Live 1976 bonus track)

 

This week has past me so slowly
The days fell on their knees
Maybe I'll take something to help me
Hope someone takes after me
There's always a change in the weather
This time I know we could get it together
If you would stay here tonight
That would be crazy tonight

Stay - that's what I meant to say or do something
But what I never say is stay this time
I really meant to so bad this time
For you can never really tell, when somebody
Wants something you want too

Heart-wrecker, heart-wrecker save me delight
Light can be vague when it sends someone new
This time tomorrow I'll know what to do
I know it's happened to you

Stay - that's what I meant to say or do something
But what I never say is stay this time
I really meant to so bad this time

For you can never really tell, when somebody
Wants so much to stay
Oh that's what I meant to say or do something
But what I never say is stay this time
I really meant to so bad this time
For you can never really tell when somebody
Wants something you want too

S-t-a-y
If you want to
If you want to
Wa... s-t-a-y
If you want to
You want to
If you want to
To
Stay, stay, stay, stay
Stay, stay, stay, stay, 
If... you... want... to... to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to
S-t-a-y

(Live from Nassau Veterans' Memorial Coliseum, Uniondale, USA, 23rd March 1976).





Strangers When We Meet

 

(Yooou, yooou, yooou)
(Yooou, yooou, yooou)

All our friends
Now seem so thin and frail
Slinky secrets
Hotter than the sun

No peachy prayers
No trendy réchauffé
I'm with you
So I can't go on

CHORUS
  All my violence
  Raining tears upon the sheet
  I'm bewildered
  For we're strangers when we meet

Blank screen TV
Preening ourselves in the snow
Forget my name
But I'm over you

Splendid sunrise
And it's a dying world
Humming Rheingold
We scavenge up our clothes

CHORUS
  All my violence
  Raging tears upon the sheets
  I'm resentful
  For we're strangers when we meet

Cold tired fingers
Tapping out your memories
Halfway sadness
Dazzled by the new

Your embrace
It was all that I feared
That whirling room
We trade by vendu

Steely resolve
Is falling from me
My poor soul
All bruised passivity
All your regrets
Ride rough-shod over me
I'm so glad
That we're strangers when we meet
I'm so thankful
That we're strangers when we meet
I'm in clover
For we're strangers when we meet
Heel head over
But we're strangers when we meet

Strangers when we meet (repeat ad. inf.)




Stupidity

(Solomon Burke)

All around the world
Every boy and girl
Come along with me
That's - a stupidity

All around the world
Every boy and girl
Take a lesson from me
That's - a stupidity

Papa says I look so crazy
Mama says I look a fool
I don't mind their criticism
They do that every day in school

So come along with me
See how much fun it can be
Watch it on TV
That's - a stupidity

So come along with me
See how much fun it can be
Watch it on TV
That's - a stupidity

So come along with me
See how much fun it can be
Watch it on TV
That's - a stupidity

All around the world
Every boy and girl
Come along with me
That's - a stupidity

(Performed live by Davy Jones and The Manish Boys).

Suffragette City

 

Hey man, ah leave me alone you know
Hey man, well Henry get off the phone, I gotta
Hey man, I gotta straighten my face
This mellow thighed chick just put my spine out of place

Hey man, my school days insane
Hey man, my work's down the drain
Hey man, well she's a total blam blam
She said she had to squeeze it but she... and then she...

(CHORUS)
    Oh don't lean on me man, 'cos you can't afford the ticket
    I'm back on Suffragette City
    Oh don't lean on me man

    You know my Suffragette City
    Is outta sight... she's all right

Hey man, ah Henry, don't be unkind, go away
Hey man, I can't take you this time, no way
Hey man, hey Droogie don't crash here
There's only room for one and here she comes, here she comes

Oh, my Suffragette City, oh my Suffragette City
Oh, Suffragette
Suffragette!




Sunday

 

Nothing remains
We could run when the rain slows
Look for the cars or signs of life
Where the heat goes
Look for the drifters
We should crawl under the bracken
Look for the shafts of light on the road
Where the heat goes

Everything has changed
For in truth, it's the beginning of nothing
And nothing has changed
Everything has changed
For in truth, it's the beginning of an end
And nothing has changed
Everything has changed

(1st voice)
In your fear
Of what we have become
Take to the fire
Now we must burn
All that we are
Rise together
Through these clouds
As on wings

(2nd voice)
In your fear, seek only peace
In you fear, seek only love
In your fear, seek only peace
In you fear, seek only love
In your fear, in your fear
As on wings

Ohhh
Woooo

This is the trip
And this the business we take
This is our number
All my trials, Lord
Will be remembered
Everything has changed




Survive

(David Bowie/Reeves Gabrels)

Oh, my
Naked eyes
I should have kept you
I should have tried
I should have been a wiser kind of guy
I miss you

Give me wings
Give me space
Give me money for a change of face
Those noisy rooms and passion pants
I loved you

Where's the morning in my life?
Where's the sense in staying right?
Who said 'Time is on my side'?
I've got ears and eyes and nothing in my life
But I'll survive your naked eyes
I'll survive

You alone across the floor
You and me and nothing more
You're the great mistake I never made
I never lied to you, I hated when you lied
But I'll survive your naked eyes
I'll survive

Beatle boys, all snowy white
Razzle dazzle clubs, every night
Wish I'd sent a Valentine
I love you

I'll survive
Naked eyes
I'll survive
I'll survive
My naked eyes
I'll survive
I'll survive
Naked eyes
I'll survive
I'll survive
I'll survive




Sweet Head

 

I tried to break away from you
From the Spics and Blacks and the gum you chew
Where the posters are torn by the muggin' gangs
And by the faggy park and the burnt out vans
I've got ninety-nine years of laying in the dark and I'm far too young to lie
I've got ninety-nine ways to play my guitar it's going to pay me before I die

CHORUS
  So bob your sweet head
  Brother Ziggy gonna play
  I'm just about the best you can hear
  Gonna rock it in your head
  Shazam! and come ball
  With my guitar and me soprano
  We can give you sweet head

I'm tough as glass and clean as night
Well if looks can love we can love alright
I'm your rubber peacock angelic whore
I'm a rod iron face upon the wall
I had ninety-nine tales of murder come life and I'm running away from it all
I got a bedroom, every mirror in town they're gonna claim me if I fall

CHORUS

  So bob your sweet head
  Brother Ziggy gonna play
  I'm just about the best you can hear
  Gonna rock deep in your head
  Shazam! and come ball
  With my guitar and me soprano
  We can give you sweet head

Sweet head, gonna give you sweet head
(Spoken:) "While ya down there"

See my eyes of blocked emotion, see my tremble, see my fall
Traumatics thick and fast, your faith in me can last
Besides I'm known to lay you, one and all

Look south the way your Mother dwells
If she knew what's going down, she'd give you hell
I'm the kind of man she warned me of
Till there was rock, you only had God

You and I have a mutual vow
We both like young, and we both like loud
I got pretty shoes, and I'm kid and proud
I'm street side out with my ear to the crowd

CHORUS

  So bob your sweet head
  Brother Ziggy gonna play
  I'm just about the best you can hear
  It's gonna rock deep in your head
  Shazam! and come ball
  With my guitar and me soprano
  We can give you - sweet head

(Spoken:) Move along Sir!
Choo Choo, Choo Choo Oo




Sweet Jane

(Lou Reed)

Standing on the corner, suitcase in my hand
Jack is in his coat, and Jane is her vest, and, me
I'm in a rock 'n' roll band.  Huh!
Ridin' in a Stutz-Bearcat, Jim
Y'know, those were different times!
Oh, all the poet, they studied rules of verse
And the ladies, they rolled their eyes
Sweet Jane!  Whoa!  Sweet Jane, oh-oh-a!  Sweet Jane!

I'll tell you something
Jack, he is a banker
And Jane, she is a clerk
Both of them save their monies, ha
And when, when they come home from work!
Ooh!  Sittin' down by the fire, oh!
The radio does play
The classical music there, Jim
"The March of the Wooden Soldiers"
All you protest kids
You can hear Jack say, get ready, ah
Sweet Jane!  Come on baby now! Sweet Jane! Oh-oh-a!  Sweet Jane!

Some people, they like to go out dancing
And other peoples, they have to work.  Just watch me now!
And there's even some evil mothers
Well they're gonna tell you that everything is just dirt
Y'know that, women, never really faint
And that villains always blink their eyes, woo!
And that, y'know, children are the only ones who blush!
And that, life is, just to die!
And, everyone who ever had a heart, oh
That wouldn't turn around and break it
And anyone who ever played a part, whoa
And wouldn't turn around and hate it!

Sweet Jane!  Whoa-oh-oh!  Sweet Jane!  Sweet Jane  Sweet Jane
Sweet Jane  Sweet Jane

Heavenly wine and roses
Seems to whisper to her when he smiles, ah
Heavenly wine and roses
Seems to whisper to her when he smiles, hey!
la-la-la-la-la-la
la-la-la-la-la-la
la-la-la-la-la-la
la-la-la-la-la-la, oh
Sweet Jane!  Sweet Jane!  Sweet Jane!  Sweet Jane!  Sweet Jane!




Sweet Thing (working lyrics)

 

It's safe in a city
To love in a doorway
To wrangle some screams from the dawn

And isn't it me
Putting pain in a stranger
Like a portrait in flesh who trails on a leash

Will you see
That I'm scared and I'm lonely
So I'll break up my room
And yawn and I'll run to the center of things
Where the knowing ones say

I'm glad that you're older than me
It makes me feel important and free
Does that make you smile
Hello isn't that neat
I'm in your way
And I'll steal every moment
Cause the fake is so true that it rots all your structure away
Like the street-fleet who whisper
If this trade is a curse then I'll bless you and turn to the crossroad and the hamburgers

Is it nice in your snowstorm
Freezing your brain
Do you think that your face looks the same
Let it be
It's all I ever wanted
It's a street with a view and a taste
It's got claws - it's got me - it's got you

(Original working lyrics written during the Diamond Dogs sessions at the Olympic Studios, Barnes, London SW13 in 1974).

So I'll break up my room, and yawn and I'll run to the centre of things

  Boys, boys, boys, boys, it's a sweet thing
  Boys, boys, it's a sweet thing, sweet thing
  If you want it, boys, get it here, thing
  'Cos hope, boys, is a cheap thing, cheap thing

I'm glad that you're older than me
Makes me feel important and free
Does that make you smile, isn't that me?
I'm in your way, and I'll steal every moment
If this trade is a curse, then I'll bless you and turn to the crossroads and hamburgers

It's got claws - it's got me - it's got you

Take My Tip

 

You think you're gonna please her
So you walk right up and tease her
But she walks right on by
You're scared to walk beside her
'Cos you're playing with the spider who possess the sky
She got the green backs, my-oh-my
You gotta act tall, think big, if you wanna make a mark in her book
Gotta get ahead, get a car, fancy clothes
Or she'll throw you right off her hook
Here's the news - you are but one fish in her back garden scene
Gonna make like a shark to be free
Something bad on your mind
Take my tip - get on out
Take my tip - get on out

You can't give all you got to take something back
Before she'll put you right up on her rack
With some others in mind
Take my tip - get on out
Take my tip - get on out

You think you're gonna please her
So you walk right up and tease her
But she walks right on by
You're scared to walk beside her
'Cos you're playing with the tiger who possess the sky
She got the green backs, my-oh-my
You gotta act tall, think big, if you wanna make a mark in her book
Gotta get ahead, get a car, fancy clothes
Or she'll throw you right off her hook
Here's the news - you are but one fish in her back garden scene
Gonna make like a shark to be free
Something bad on your mind
Get it off, take my tip
Get it off, take my tip

You can't give all you have to take something back
Before she'll put you right up on the rack
With some others in mind
Take my tip - get on out
Take my tip - get on out
Take my tip - get on out
Take my tip - get on out

Teenage Wildlife

 

Well, how come you only want tomorrow
With its promise of something hard to do
A real life adventure worth more than pieces of gold
Blue skies above, sun on your arms, strength in your stride
And hope in those squeaky clean eyes
You'll get chilly receptions everywhere you go
Blinded with desire - I guess the season is on

So you train by shadow boxing, search for the truth
But it's all, but it's all used up
Break open your million dollar weapon
And push your luck, still you push, still you push your luck
A broken nosed mogul are you
One of the new wave boys

Same old thing in brand new drag
Comes sweeping into view, oh-ooh
As ugly as a teenage millionaire
Pretending it's a whiz kid world
You'll take me aside, and say
"Well, David, what shall, shall I do?
They wait for me in the hallway"
I'll say "Don't ask me, I don't know any hallways"
But they move in numbers and they've got me in a corner
And I feel like a group of one, no-no
They can't do this to me
I'm not some piece of teenage wildlife

Those midwives to history put on their bloody robes
And the word is that the hunted one is out there on his own
And you're alone for maybe the last time
And you breathe for a long time
Then you howl like a wolf in a trap
And you daren't look behind

You fall to the ground like a leaf from the tree
And look up one time at that vast blue sky
Scream out aloud as they shoot you down
No no, I'm not a piece of teenage wildlife
I'm not a piece of teenage wildlife

And no one will have seen and no one will confess
The fingerprints will prove that you couldn't pass the test
There'll be others on the line filing past, who'll whisper low
I miss you he had to go
Well each to his own, he was
Another piece of teenage wildlife, oh-oh-oh-ohh
Another piece of teenage wildlife, oh-oh-oh-ohh
Another piece of teenage wild...
Life
Wild - Life
Wild - Life
Wild - Life




Telling Lies

 

Telling Lies

Gorgeous girls are bound to meet
To talk of stars and kings and feet
Through the chromosomes of space and time
Me I'm fast like bad infection
Gasping for my resurrection
Swear to me in times of war and stress
Telling lies, telling lies
Telling lies, telling lies

CHORUS
    (Oo - Ah, visionary)
    (Oo - Ah, visionary)
  Telling lies
    (Feels like something's gonna happen this year)
  Starting fires
    (Oo - Ah, visionary)
    (Oo - Ah, visionary)
  Telling lies
    (Feels like something's gonna happen this year)
  Telling lies
  
Shadow falls on shrinking smile
See me poised at the happy games
Standing in the mouth of all that's pure
Come straggling in your tattered rainments
You'll come to me in tears and blame
I'm your future, I'm tomorrow, I'm the end

Telling lies (Oo - Ah, Oo - Ah)
Telling lies (Oo - Ah, Oo - Ah)
Telling lies (Oo - Ah, Oo - Ah)

CHORUS (repeat ad lib)




That's A Promise - (1965 demo)

 

Baby, you can own two hearts
Baby, don't try to tear me apart
Someone's got to go and I won't, I won't
That's a promise

Baby, you can't fool around
Baby, can't turn me upside down
Someone's got to go and I won't, I won't
That's a promise

It's just a matter of time before you call him on the phone
Tell him please, please leave him alone
Please leave him alone
It's just a matter of time, call him on the phone
Tell him please, please leave him alone
Please leave him alone

Baby, you've got me used
Baby, can't you be like you?
Someone's got to go and I won't, I won't
That's a promise
(Ad lib to end)

(Appeared on an Oak label acetate, recorded October 1965 at R.G. Jones Studios, Morden, Surrey).





That's Motivation

 

Do you hear what I hear?
Do you see what I see?
Colin, I want you to use your imagination
You wake up one morning and you ask yourself:

Why it is so exciting?
What makes me dramatic?
You're trying to say something about yourself
The dazzling crime of wisdom

You fall for reality
You're bruised and bewildered
Then you learn to fall in love with yourself
That's motivation

You raise yourself high
Presenting your soul
You step from the shadows
You hear the command
An image to dream
You tremble permission
Tomorrow's rewards bloody skies of today
You'll step out of time
Into life's every dream
A life of such powerful meaning

Now you have class
Now you have splash
Now you have mass motivation

Here's an image I recommend
Here's a product you will die for
Here's a nightmare that will never end
??

You know you got something
You know you got style
We don't take much just a little bit
That's motivation

Welcome to the world of your dreams, Colin
Where you can be what you want
Commit horrible sins
And get away with it

  Lust
  Gluttony
  Pride
  Anger
  Sloth
  Avarice
  And jealousy

You know you got something
You know you got the style
We don't take much, but a little bit
That's motivation

No more false illusion
Goodbye to confusion
Stand out from the madding crowd
Motivation is symphony

Symphony in style - (that's motivation)
It's brilliant, original - (that's motivation)
Stimulating, encouragement - (that's motivation)
As precious from home - (that's motivation)
So what - (motivation)
Say what - (motivation)
New - (moti...)
So - (moti...)

Now you have class motiv...
Now you have mass motivation




That's Where My Heart Is

 

I just cannot believe
That you want me
Beg at your door
I just cannot believe
That you want me
Forever more
Time and time I tried to make you mine
I didn't think it would be such a short time
Before you came my way

Up where the moon is shining so bright
That's where my heart is tonight
Up where the moon is so bright
That's where my heart is tonight

I thought my day would come
When I would be
The only one
I thought my day would come
Under the moon
And under the sun
Now I shout through all the streets today
Lucky me, your love has come my way
Now tell me I was a fool

Up where the moon is shining so brightly
That's where my heart is tonight
Up where the moon is so bright
That's where my heart is tonight

I believe that dreams come through
I believe, because of you
He who made the stars in the sky
Made the world for you and I

I just cannot believe
That you want me
Beg at your door
I just cannot believe
That you want me
Forever more
Time and time I tried to make you mine
I didn't think it would be such a short time
Before you came my way

Up where the moon is shining so bright
That's where my heart is tonight
Up where the moon is so bright
That's where my heart is tonight

(Demo track recorded in 1965 appears on Early On 1964-1966).





The Bewlay Brothers

 

And so the story goes they wore the clothes
They said the things to make it seem improbable
The whale of a lie like the hope it was
And the good men tomorrow
Had their feet in the wallow
And their heads of brawn were nicer shorn
And how they bought their positions with saccharin and trust
And the world was asleep to our latent fuss
Sighing, the swirl through the streets
Like the crust of the Sun
The Bewlay Brothers
In our wings that bark
Flashing teeth of brass
Standing tall in the dark
Oh, and we were gone
Hanging out with your dwarf men
We were so turned on
By your lack of conclusions

Well, I was stone and he was wax
So he could scream and still relax, unbelievable
And we'd frightened the small children away
And our talk was old and dust would flow
Thru' our veins and lo' it was midnight
Back o' the kitchen door
Like the grim face on the Cathedral floor
And the solid book we wrote
Cannot be found today

And it was stalking time for the Moonboys
The Bewlay Brothers
With our backs on the arch
In the Devil-may-be-here
But he can't sing about that
Oh, and we were gone
Real cool traders
We were so turned on
You thought we were fakers

And now the dress is hung, the ticket pawned
The Factor Max that proved the fact
Is melted down
Woven on the edging of my pillow
And my Brother lays upon the Rocks
He could be dead, he could be not
He could be you
He's Chameleon, comedian, Corinthian and caricature
"Shooting-up pie-in-the-sky"
The Bewlay Brothers
In the feeble and the bad
The Bewlay Brothers
In the blessed and cold
In the crutch-hungry dark
Was where we flayed our mark
Oh, and we were gone
Kings of Oblivion
We were so turned on
In the mind-warp pavilion

Lay me place and bake me pie
I'm starving for me gravy
Leave my shoes and door unlocked
I might just slip away, hey!
Just for the day, hey!
Please come away, hey! (repeat ad inf.)




The Dreamers

(David Bowie/Reeves Gabrels)

Black eyed Ravens
They spiral down
They tilt his head back
To the flame filled sunset
Raise their guns high
As the darken falls
These are the days boys

Shallow man
Shallow man... and they
Eats in the doorway
With his head inclined
And he's always in decline
No-one heals anymore
So he shrinks as they ride
Under vermilion sky

So it goes
Just a searcher
A lonely soul
The last of the dreamers

Shallow man
Shallow man
Speaks to the shadows
Moves his trembling hands
And he's always a little late
For the dawning of the day

So it goes
Just a searcher
Lonely soul
The last of the dreamers




The Drowned Girl

(Bertolt Brecht. Translation: Dominic Muldowney)

Once she had drowned and started her slow descent
Down the streams to where the great rivers broaden
Oh, the open sky chant most magnificent
As if it was acting as her body's guardian
Wreck and duck weed slowly increased her weight
By clasping her in their slimy grip
Through her limbs, the cold blooded fishes played
Creatures and plant life kept on, thus obstructing her last trip

And the sky that same evening grew dark as smoke
And its stars through the night kept the brightness still soaring
But it quickly grew clear when dawn now broke
To see that she got one further morning
Once her pallid trunk had rotted beyond repair
It happened quite slowly that she gently slipped from God's thoughts
First with her face, then her hands, right at the last with her hair
Leaving those corpse-choked rivers just one more corpse

(Recorded for 1982 BBC TV production of Baal).

The Gospel According To Tony Day

 

The Gospel according to Tony Day (x3)

Rotten Tony!

The Gospel according to Brendan O'Lear (x3)
If I buy him a Scotch, he'll buy me a beer
Tight fist, friends

The Gospel according to Pat Hewitt (x3)
If it's written on a sweater then I'd better not do it
Ah
Got to, got to

Your mind, blow it
Blow it

The Gospel according to Marianne Brent (x3)
She'll be mine if I pay the rent
Good old Marianne, who needs friends, oh

Waste of flipping time, take a look at my life and you'll see
Take a quick butchers, rotten Harry down The Oak
Wouldn't give you tuppence for him

The Jean Genie

 

Small Jean Genie snuck off to the city
Strung out on lasers an' slash back blazers
An' ate all your razors while pulling the waiter
Talking 'bout Monroe an' walking on Snow White
New York's a go-go an' everything tastes nice
Poor little Greenie
Ooo-oo

(Spoken: Get back on it)
  Jean Genie lives on his back
  The Jean Genie loves chimney stacks
  He's outrageous, he screams and he bawls
  The Jean Genie let yourself go! oh

He sits like a man but he smiles like a reptile
She'll love him, she'll love him but just for a short while
She'll scratch in the sand, won't let go his hand
He says he's a beautician and sells you nutrition
An' keeps all your dead hair for making up underwear
Poor little Greenie
Ooo-oo

CHORUS

He's so simple-minded he can't drive his module
Bites on the neon and sleeps in a capsule
Loves to be loved, loves to be loved
Ooo-oo (x2)

  Oh the Jean Genie lives on his back
  The Jean Genie loves chimney stacks
  An' he's outrageous, he screams and he bawls
  The Jean Genie let yourself go! oh

Go!
Go!

  The Jean Genie lives on his back
  The Jean Genie loves chimney stacks
  He's outrageous, he screams and he bawls
  Jean Genie let yourself go! oh!

Go!
Oh go!

The Last Thing You Should Do

(Lyrics: David Bowie. Music: David Bowie/Reeves Gabrels/Mark Plati)

What are you doing to yourself?
What are you doing to yourself?
What are you doing to yourself?
It's the last thing you should do

Nobody laughs anymore

Nobody laughs anymore
It's the worst thing you can do

Save the last dance for me
Catch the last bus with me
Give the last kiss to me
It's the safest thing to do

Yeah (x2)

What are you doing to yourself?
What are you doing to yourself?
What are you doing to yourself?
It's the last thing you should do

Nobody laughs anymore
Nobody laughs anymore
Nobody laughs anymore
It's the worst thing you can do

Save the last dance for me
Catch the last bus with me
Give the last kiss to me
It's the safest thing to do

Yeah (x5)




The London Boys

 

Bow Bells strikes another night
Your eyes are heavy and your limbs all ache
You've bought some coffee, butter and bread
You can't make a thing 'cos the meter's dead
You moved away
Told your folks you're gonna stay away

Bright lights, Soho, Wardour Street
You hope you make friends with the guys that you meet
Somebody shows you round
Now you've met the London boys
Things seem good again, someone cares about you

Oh, the first time that you tried a pill
You feel a little queasy, decidedly ill
You're gonna be sick, but you mustn't lose face
To let yourself down would be a big disgrace
With the London boys, with the London boys

You're only seventeen, but you think you've grown
In the month you've been away from your parents' home
You take the pills too much
You don't give a damn about that jobs you've got
So long as you're with the London boys

A London boy, oh a London boy
Your flashy clothes are your pride and joy
A London boy, a London boy
You're crying out loud that you're a London boy
You think you've had a lot of fun
But you ain't got nothing, you're on the run
It's too late now, 'cos you're out there boy
You've got it made with the rest of the toys
Now you wish you'd never left your home
You've got what you wanted but you're on your own
With the London boys
Now you've met the London boys (3 times)

(Original 7" single version recorded with The Buzz at R.G. Jones Studio, 19th October 1966. Producer Tony Hatch).





The London Boys (2000 version)

 

Bow Bells strikes another night
Your eyes are heavy and your limbs all ache
You've bought some coffee, butter and bread
You can't make a thing 'cos the meter's dead
You moved away
Told your folks you're gonna stay away

Bright lights, Soho, Wardour Street
You hope you make friends with the guys you meet
Somebody shows you round
Now you've met the London boys
Things seem good again, someone cares about you

The first time that you popped a pill
You feel a little queasy, decidedly ill
You're gonna be sick, but you mustn't lose face
To let yourself down would be a big disgrace
With the London boys, with the London boys

You're only seventeen, but you think you've grown
In the month you've been away from your parents' home
You take the pills too much
And you don't give a damn about the job you've got
As long as you're with your London boys

A London boy, oh a London boy
Your flashy clothes are your pride and joy
A London boy, a London boy
You're crying out loud that you're a London boy
You think you've had a lot of fun
But you ain't got nothing, you're on the run
It's too late now, you're out there boy
You've got it made with the rest of the toys
Now you wish you'd never left your home
You've got what you wanted, yeah on your own
With the London boys
Now you've met the London boys (3 times)

(Re-recorded for the planned March 2001 unreleased album Toy).





The Man - (aka Shadow Man)

 

 





The Man Who Sold The World

 

We passed upon the stair, we spoke of was and when
Although I wasn't there, he said I was his friend
Which came as some surprise I spoke into his eyes
I thought you died alone, a long long time ago

Oh no, not me
I never lost control
You're face to face
With the man who sold the world

I laughed and shook his hand, and made my way back home
I searched for form and land, for years and years I roamed
I gazed a gazely stare at all the millions here
We must have died alone, a long long time ago

Who knows? Not me
We never lost control
You're face to face
With the man who sold the world




The Mirror

 

Wash your face before your faded make-up makes a mark
The mirror will watch over you
Pierrot never calls so pack your face and chase the dark
The mirrors hung up on you
Don't be last your friends and your reflections
It's autodirection now

Poor Harlequin, you're quite an exception
Fade Troubadour - on a downer
Gay Harlequin doesn't believe in you
Doesn't believe it's true - such a downer

(Written and recorded for 'The Looking Glass Murders' production for Scottish TV. Recorded at The Gateway Theatre, Edinburgh, Scotland on 1st February 1970).





The Motel

 

Well we're living, in a safety zone
Don't be holding back from me
We're living from hour to hour down here
And we'll take it when we can

It's a kind of living which recognises
The death of the odourless man
When nothing is vanity nothing's too slow
It's not Eden but it's no sham

There is no hell
There is no shame
There is no hell
Like an old hell
There is no hell

And it's lights up boys
Lights up boys

Explosion falls upon deaf ears
While we're swimming in a sea of sham
Living in the shadow of vanity
A complex fashion for a simple man

And there is no hell
And there is no shame
And there is no hell
Like an old hell
There is no hell

And silence flies on its brief flight
A razor sharp crap shoot affair
And we light up our lives

And there's no more of me exploding you
Re-exposing you
Like everybody do
Re-exploding you

I don't know what to use
Make somebody move
Me exploding
Me exploding you




The Mysteries

 






The Passenger

(Lyrics: Iggy Pop. Music: Ricky Gardiner)

I am the passenger
And I ride and I ride
I ride through the city's backsides
I see the stars come
Out of the sky
Yeah the bright and hollow sky
You know it looks
So good tonight

I am the passenger
I stay under glass
I look through my
Window so bright
I see the stars
Come out tonight
I see the bright
And hollow sky
Over the city's
Ripped backside
And everything looks good tonight

CHORUS
  Singing la la la la
  La-la-la-la
  La la la la
  La-la-la-la
  La la la la
  La-la-la-la
  La la

Get into the car
We'll be the passenger
We'll ride through the city tonight
We'll see the city's ripped backsides
We'll see the bright and
Hollow sky
We'll see the stars that shine
So bright
Stars made for us tonight

O the passenger
How how he rides
O the passenger
He rides and he rides
He looks through his window
What does he see
He sees the sign and
Hollow sky
He sees the stars
Come out tonight
He sees the city's ripped backsides
He sees the winding ocean drive
And everything was made
For you and me
All of it was made for
You and me - 'cos it
Just belongs to you and me
So let's take a ride and
See what's mine

CHORUS

O the passenger
He rides and he rides
He sees things from under glass
He looks through his window inside
He sees the things he knows are his
He sees the bright
Hollow sky
He sees the city
Sleep at night
He sees the stars
Come out tonight
And all of it is yours and mine
And all of it is yours and mine
So let's ride and ride
And ride and ride

CHORUS (repeat ad. inf.)




The Prettiest Star - (original single version)

 

Cold fire, you got everything but cold fire
You will be my rest and peace child
I moved up to take a place, near you

So tired, it's the sky that makes you feel tried
It's a trick to make you see wide
It can all but break your heart, in pieces

Staying back in your memory
Are the movies in the dark
How you move is all it takes
To sing a song of when I loved
The Prettiest Star

Staying back in your memory
Are the movies in the dark
How you move is all it takes
To sing a song of when I loved
The Prettiest Star

One day, though it might as well be someday
You will rise up high and take us all the way
All because of what you are
The Prettiest Star




The Prettiest Star

 

Cold fire, you've got everything but cold fire
You will be my rest and peace child
I moved up to take a place, near you

So tired, it's the sky that makes you feel tried
It's a trick to make you see wide
It can all but break your heart, in pieces

Staying back in your memory
Are the movies in the past
How you move is all it takes
To sing a song of when I loved
The Prettiest Star

One day though it might as well be someday
You and I will rise up all the way
All because of what you are
The Prettiest Star

Staying back in your memory
Are the movies in the past
How you move is all it takes
To sing a song of when I loved
The Prettiest Star

One day though it might as well be someday
You and I will rise up all the way
All because of what you are

The Pretty Things Are Going To Hell

(David Bowie/Reeves Gabrels)

What to wear
What to say
What to do on a sunny day
Who to phone
Who to fight
Who to dance with on a Sunday night

I'm reaching the very edge, you know
I'm reaching the very edge
I'm going to the other side this time
Reaching the very edge

CHORUS
  You're still breathing but you don't know why
  Life's a bit and sometimes you die
  You're still breathing but you just can't tell
  Don't hold your breath but the pretty things are going to hell

I am a drug
I am a dragon
I am the best jazz you've ever seen
I am a dragon
I am the sky
I am the blood at the corner of your eye
I found the secrets, I found the gold
I find you out before you grow old
I find you out before you grow old

What is eternal?
What is damned?
What is clay and what is sand?
Who to dis?
Who to truss?
Who to listen to?
Who to suss?

I'm reaching the very edge, you know
I'm reaching the very edge
I'm going to the other side this time
I'm reaching the very edge

CHORUS

I am a dragon
I am a drug
I am the best jazz you've ever heard
I am a dragon
I am the sky
I am the blood at the corner of your eye
I found the secrets, I found the gold
I find you out before you grow old
I find you out before you grow old

REPEAT (4x)
  The pretty things are going to hell
  They wore it out but they wore it well

You're still breathing but you don't know why
You're still breathing but you just can't tell
Don't hold your breath but the pretty things are going to hell

The Secret Life Of Arabia

(Lyrics: David Bowie. Music: David Bowie/Brian Eno/Carlos Alomar)

The secret life of Arabia
Secret secrets never seen
Secret secrets ever green

I was running at the speed of life
Through morning's thoughts and fantasies
Then I saw your eyes at the cross fades
Secret secrets never seen
Secret secrets ever green

The secret life of Arabia
Never here, never seen
Secret life ever green

The secret life of Arabia
You must see the movie the sand in my eyes
I walk through a desert song when the heroine dies

Arabia (secret secret)
Arabia (secret)
Arabia (secret secret)

THREE TIMES:
  Arabia
  Arabia (secret secret)

The secret life of Arabia
Never here never seen
Secret life ever green

(Recorded during the "Heroes" sessions at Hansa Tonstudio, Berlin, Germany in 1977).





The Supermen

 

When all the world was very young
And mountain magic heavy hung
The supermen would walk in file
Guardians of a loveless isle
And gloomy browed with super fear their tragic endless lives
Could heave nor sigh
In solemn, perverse serenity, wondrous beings chained to life

Strange games they would play then
No death for the perfect men
Life rolls into one for them
So softly a supergod cries

Where all were minds in uni-thought
Power weird by mystics taught
No pain, no joy, no power too great
Colossal strength to grasp a fate
Where sad-eyed mermen tossed in slumbers
Nightmare dreams no mortal mind could hold
A man would tear his brother's flesh, a chance to die
To turn to mold

Far out in the red sky
Far out from the sad eyes
Strange, mad celebration
So softly a supergod cries

Far out in the red sky
Far out from the sad eyes
Strange, mad celebration
So softly a supergod dies




The Voyeur Of Utter Destruction (As Beauty)

(Lyrics: David Bowie. Music: David Bowie / Brian Eno / Reeves Gabrels)

Turn, and turn again
Turn, and turn again

I shake
And stare at the sun
Till my eyes burn

I shake
At the mothers brutal vermin

I shake
And stare at the watery moon
With the same desire
As the sober Philistine
An' I shake

Turn and turn again

Blood, the pain and blade
Turn and turn again

The screw
Is a tightening atrocity

I shake
For the reeking flesh
Is as romantic as hell

The need
To have seen it all

The voyeur of utter destruction
As beauty
An' I shake

Turn and turn again

I shake
Turn and turn again
I shake

I shake
I shake

VERSE (two times)
  Research has pierced all extremes of my sex
  Call it a day, call it a day
  Needle point life, blind the will to be next
  Call it a day, call it a day

Call it a day (x15.)
Today (repeat ad. inf.)




The Wedding

 






The Wedding Song

 

These are silver wings
These are golden eyes
These are floating clouds
Angel for life

Dreaming alone and I feel that someone
Listens to me
Angel for life

These are silver wings
These are golden eyes
These are floating clouds
Angel for life

Heaven is smiling down, heaven's girl in a wedding gown
I'm gonna be so good, just like a good boy should
I'm gonna change my ways
Angel for life

Of all the Saints alive
Don't I feel like a Saint alive
She's not mine for eternity
Though I'll never fly so high
I'm smiling

I believe in magic
Angel for life




The Width Of A Circle

 

In the corner of the morning in the past
I would sit and blame the master first and last
All the roads were straight and narrow
And the prayers were small and yellow
And the rumour spread that I was aging fast
Then I ran across a monster who was sleeping by a tree
And I looked and frowned and the monster was me

Well, I said "Hello" and I said "Hello"
And I asked "Why not?" and I replied "I don't know"
So we asked a simple blackbird, who was happy as can be
And he laughed insane and quipped "Kahlil Gibran"
So I cried for all the others till the day was nearly through
For I realised that God's a young man too

So I said "So long" and I waved bye-bye
And I smashed my soul and traded my mind
Got laid by a young bordello
I was vaguely half asleep
For which my reputation swept back home in drag
And the moral of this magic spell
Negotiates my hide
When God did take my logic for a ride
(Riding along)

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

He swallowed his pride and puckered his lips
And showed me the leather belt round his hips
My knees were shaking my cheeks aflame
He said "You'll never go down to the Gods again"
(Turn around, go back!)

He struck the ground a cavern appeared
And I smelt the burning pit of fear
We crashed a thousand yards below
I said "Do it again, do it again"
(Turn around, go back!)

His nebulous body swayed above
His tongue swollen with Devil's love
The snake and I, a venom high
I said "Do it again, do it again"
(Turn around, go back!)

Breathe, breathe, breathe deeply
And I was seething, breathing deeply
Spitting sentry, horned and tailed
Waiting for you

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh




There Is A Happy Land

 

There is a happy land where only children live
They don't have the time to learn the ways
Of you Sir, Mr. Grown-Up

There's a special place in the rhubarb fields underneath the leaves
It's a secret place and adults aren't allowed there, Mr. Grown-Up
Go away, Sir

Charlie Brown's got half a crown, he's gonna buy a kite
Jimmy's ill with chicken pox, and Tommy's learned to ride his bike
Tiny Tim sings prayers and hymns, he's so small we don't notice him
He gets in the way, but we always let him play with us

Mother calls, but we don't hear
There's lots more things to do
It's only five o'clock, and we're not tired yet
But we will be, very shortly

Sissy Steven plays with girls, someone made him cry
Tony climbed a tree and fell, trying hard to touch the sky
Tommy lit a fire one day, nearly burnt the field away
Tommy's mum found out, but he put the blame on me and Ray

There is a happy land where only children live
You've had your chance and now the doors are closed Sir, Mr. Grown-Up
Go away, Sir

Boo, de boo, de boo, de boo dup (repeat)




Things To Do

 

Sometimes, sometimes I feel blue
When I'm, when I'm feeling good
All I, all I have to do
Is think of you, you, you
And the things you do, do, do

I don't know the reason
That you've got me this way
But when I first met you
Oh happy day
I'll make my point here
I just gotta say
I love you, you, you
And the things you do, do, do

Well if the Lord is my shepherd
And Peter was a saint
It's kind of obvious to me
Big guy, a ???? you ain't
But if you turned at the reek?
I was cunning and mean
I'd have to think maybe
That the Lord himself could save me

Sometimes, sometimes I feel blue
When I'm, when I'm feeling good
All I, all I have to do
Is think of you, you, you
And the things you do, do, do

(Recorded during the Ava Cherry and The Astronettes sessions at the Olympic Studios, Barnes, London SW13 in November 1974).





This Boy

(John Lennon/Paul McCartney)

That boy took my love away
He'll regret it someday
But this boy wants you back again

That boy isn't good for you
Though he may want you too
This boy wants you back again

Oh, and this boy would be happy
Just to love you, buy oh my-yi-yi
That boy won't be happy
Till he's seen you cry-hi-hi

This boy wouldn't mind the pain
Would always feel the same
If this boy gets you back again
This boy. This boy

(Performed live at on 27th August 1972 at Bristol Locarno Centre, Electric Village, in Bristol, although appears incorrectly on several bootlegs as the Friars Club, Aylesbury gig from 18th July 1972).





This Is Not America

(David Bowie/Pat Metheny)

This is not America, sha la la la la

A little piece of you
A little peace in me
Will die (This is not a miracle)
For this is not America

Blossom fails to bloom this season
Promise not to stare
Too long (This is not America)
For this is not the miracle

There was a time
A storm that blew so pure
For this could be the biggest sky
That I could have the faintest idea

(For this is not America, sha la la la la, sha la la la la, sha la la la la
This is not America, no, this is not, sha la la la la)

Snowman melting from the inside
Falcon spirals to the ground (This could be the biggest sky)
So bloody red
Tomorrow's plans

A little piece of you
The little piece in me
Will die (This could be a miracle)
For this is not America

There was a time
A wind that blew so young
For this could be the biggest sky
And I could have the faintest idea

(For this is not America, sha la la la la, sha la la la la, sha la la la la
This is not America, no, this is not, sha la la la
This is not America, no, this is not
This is not America, no, this is not, sha la la la)




Threepenny Joe

 

 





Threepenny Pierrot

 

Threepenny Pierrot - we love you
Threepenny Pierrot - loves us too
Pockets of gladness, gay time eyes
Comical hero, Threepenny Pierrot

Happy little feet that dance all day
Lonely little heart with lots to say
Stepping footprints on your mind
Offering thoughts of Columbine

Bang the drum and blow the bugle call
Pierrot takes the stage to play for all
For here's a life his fortune rules
Forsaken by his Columbine

Threepenny Pierrot - we love you
Threepenny Pierrot - loves us too
Pockets of gladness, gay time eyes
Comical hero, Threepenny Pierrot

To tap his feet to greet dear Harlequin
The hearts of folks so keenly hard to win
A patchwork frame of tears and wine
Are nectar for cruel Columbine

???  the three he leaves the stage forlorn
Puppets cold, their faces sad and drawn
Relive each trial of rise and fall
The love which lacks between us all

Threepenny Pierrot - we love you
Threepenny Pierrot - loves us too
Pockets of gladness, gay time eyes
Comical hero, Threepenny Pierrot
(repeat)

Thru' These Architect's Eyes

(Lyrics: David Bowie. Music: David Bowie/Reeves Gabrels)

(Living in a golden age, the golden age, the golden age now) (x3)

An' stomping along on this big Philip Johnson
Is delay just wasting my time?
Looking across at Richard Rogers
Scheming dreams to blow both their minds
It's difficult you see
To give up baby
To leave a job
When you know
You know the money's from day to day

CHORUS
  All the majesty of a city landscape
  All the soaring days in our lives
  All the concrete dreams in my mind's eye
  All the joy I see
  Thru' these architect's eyes

(Living in a golden age, the golden age, the golden age now)
Cold winter bleeds on the girders of Babel
This stone boy watching the crawling land
Rings of flesh and the towers of iron
The steaming caves and the rocks and the sand

Stomping along on this big Phillip Johnson
Is delay just wasting my time?
It's difficult you see
To give up baby
These summer scumholes
This god damned starving life

CHORUS

It's difficult you see
It's difficult you see

CHORUS




Thursday's Child

(David Bowie/Reeves Gabrels)

All of my life I've tried so hard
Doing my best with what I had
Nothing much happened all the same

Something about me stood apart
A whisper of hope that seemed to fail
Maybe I'm born right out of my time?
Breaking my life in two

  (Throw me tomorrow... oh, oh, oh)
Now that I've really got a chance
  (Throw me tomorrow... oh, oh)
Everything's falling into place
  (Throw me tomorrow... oh, oh)
Seeing my past to let it go
  (Throw me tomorrow... oh, oh)
Only for you I don't regret
That I was Thursday's Child

Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday born I was (x2)

Sometimes I cried my heart to sleep
Shuffling days and lonesome nights
Sometimes my courage fell to my feet

Lucky old sun is in my sky
Nothing prepared me for your smile
Lighting the darkness of my soul
Innocence in your arms

  (Throw me tomorrow... oh, oh, oh)
Now that I've really got a chance
  (Throw me tomorrow... oh, oh)
Everything's falling into place
  (Throw me tomorrow... oh, oh)
Seeing my past to let it go
  (Yeah, throw me tomorrow... oh, oh)
Only for you I don't regret
That I was Thursday's Child

Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday born I was Thursday's Child
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday born I was Thursday's Child
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday born I was
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday born I was




Time

 

Time - He's waiting in the wings
      He speaks of senseless things
      His script is you and me, boy

Time - He flexes like a whore
      Falls wanking to the floor
      His trick is you and me, boy

Time - In Quaaludes and red wine
      Demanding Billy Dolls
      And other friends of mine
      Take your time

The sniper in the brain, regurgitating drain
Incestuous and vain, and many other last names
Oh well I look at my watch it says 9:25 and I think 'Oh God I'm still alive'

Should be on by now
We should be on by now

La, la, la, la,   la, la, la, la (x4 times)

You - are not a victim
You - just scream with boredom
You - are not evicting time

Chimes - Goddamn, you're looking old
        You'll freeze and catch a cold
        'Cos you've left your coat behind
        Take your time

Breaking up is hard, but keeping dark is hateful
I had so many dreams, I had so many breakthroughs
But you my love were kind, but love has left you dreamless
The door to dreams was closed, your park was real and dreamless
Perhaps you're smiling now, smiling through this darkness
But all I had to give was guilt for dreaming

We should be on by now (x5 times)
La, la, la, la,  la, la, la, la (x11 times)

Yeah, time!




Time Will Crawl

 

I've never sailed on a sea
I would not challenge a giant
I could not take on the church
Till the 21st century lose

I know a Government man
He was as blind as the Moon, and he
He saw the Sun in the night
He took a top-gun pilot, and he
He made him fly through a hole
Till he grew real old, and he
And he never came down
He just flew till he burst

  Time will crawl
Till our mouths run dry
  Time will crawl
Till our feet grow small
  Time will crawl
Till our tails fall off
  Time will crawl
Till the 21st century lose

I saw a black, black stream
Full of white-eyed fish
And a drowning man
With no eyes at all
I felt a warm, warm breeze
That melted metal and steel
I got a bad migraine
That lasted three long years, and
And the pills that I took
Made my fingers disappear

Time will crawl
Time will crawl
Time will crawl
Till the 21st century lose
Go!

Time will crawl
Time will crawl

You were a talented child
You came to live in our town
We never bothered to scream
When your mask went on
We only smelt the gas
As we lay down to sleep

  Time will crawl
And our heads bowed down
  Time will crawl
And our eyes fell out
  Time will crawl
And the streets run red
  Time will crawl
Till the 21st century lose

And our mouths run dry
  Time will crawl
And our feet grow small
  Time will crawl
And our tails fall off
  Time will crawl
Till the 21st century lose

And our heads bowed down
  Time will crawl
And our eyes fall out
  Time will crawl
And the streets run red
  Time will crawl
Till the 21st century lose

  Time will crawl
For the crazy child
  Time will crawl
We'll give every life
  Time will crawl
For the crackpot notion
  Till the 21st century lose

  Time will crawl
La la la la la la
  Time will crawl
La la la la la la
  Time will crawl
Till the 21st century lose

  Time will crawl
  Time will crawl
  Time will crawl




Tin Machine

(David Bowie/Reeves Gabrels/Tony Sales/Hunt Sales)

Tin machine
Tin machine

Take me anywhere
Somewhere without alcohol
Or goons with muddy hair

Tin machine
Tin machine

Tin machine
Tin machine

The zombies that I pass
The guy that beats his baby up
The preachers and their past

Tin machine
Tin machine

Tin machine

Baby doll
Baby doll

Clarity in prayer
There's more than money moving here
There's mindless maggot glare
Working horrors - humping Tories
Spittle on their chins
Carving up my children's future
Read 'em pal and grin

Raging raging raging
Burning in my room
C'mon and get a good idea
C'mon and get it soon
I'm waiting on the fire escape
I'm not exactly well
I'm neither red nor black or white
I'm grey and blown to hell

Tin machine
Tin machine

Make some new computer thing
That puts me on the moon
Not this psycho-time-bomb planet
Poised to meet its maker
Shake a leg

Tin machine
Tin machine

One sick deathless duty to remain endangered species
They reach right out to touch someone
Then wash their crusty hands

Tin machine
Tin machine

Baby doll
Baby doll

Blue suede tuneless wonders
Mass confusion - faithless blues
Night that spews out watchmen
Mopping up another fortune
Fractured words and Branca-sonic
Anger trapped behind locked doors
And right between the eyes

Raging raging raging
Burning in my room
C'mon and get a good idea
C'mon and get it soon
I'm waiting on the fire escape
I'm not exactly well
I'm neither red nor black or white
I'm grey and blown to hell

Tin machine

Tin machine
Tin machine

Tin machine
Tin machine

Tin machine
Tin machine
Take me anywhere




Tiny Girls

(Iggy Pop/David Bowie)

Well the day begins
You don't want to live
'Cos you can't believe
In the one you're with
'Cos you know her tricks
And you know her past
When she makes a face
You just have to laugh
And you feel like such a know-it-all
When you only want just a tiny girl
And you hope she'll sing

So you turn around
Toward the tiny girls
Who have got no tricks
Who have got no past
Yea that's what you think
And you hope she'll sing
But she sings of greed
Like a young banshee
And she wants for this
And she wants for that
What did you think




Tired Of My Life

 

I don't know why, but I'm tired of my mind
Pain is over me, overloading
I don't know why, but you're trying to be kind
Take off your silver smile, throw your head back
And cry, ahhh...

I don't believe, but I'm trying to decide
Which game is best for me, which can I bear
You don't perceive, so I'm leading you away
Home where you've never been, non-returning
So cry, ahhh...

Throw the rock upon a road and it breaks into pieces
Shake a branch upon the snow, the sun is defeated
Pull the curtains on yesterday and it seems so much later
Put a bullet in my brain and I make all the papers
Ohhh...

I don't know why, but I'm tired of my life
The clouds are in my eyes, overtaking
Ahhh..."

Tonight

(Iggy Pop/David Bowie)

VERSE
  I saw my baby
  She was turning blue
  I knew that soon
  Her young life was through
  And so I got down on my knees
  Down by her bed
  And these are the words
  To her I said

Everything will be alright tonight
Everything will be alright tonight
No one moves
No one talks
No one thinks
No one walks tonight
Tonight
Everyone will be alright tonight
Everyone will be alright tonight
No one moves
No one talks
No one thinks
No one walks tonight
Tonight

I am gonna love you till the end
I will love you till I reach the end
I will love you till I die
I will see you in the sky
Tonight




Too Dizzy

(David Bowie/Erdal Kizilcay)

There's too much talking for a night drive
Too much mist in front of my eyes
I'm trying not to lose control
But you're just pushin' for a fight
You look trapped, turn the radio on
Too much smoke, air conditioning gone
But I'm helpless in love with you
But you're just looking for a break

Is it love or is it what?
Who's this guy I'm gonna blow away?
What kind of love is he giving you?
I'm-a-dizzy's what I'm trying to say
Too Dizzy - You can't have a lover
Too Dizzy - It's me and no other
I'm a bad loser - I'm-a-shakin' in anger
Too Dizzy - you can't have no lover

2nd time: Don't come any harder
    Don't come any closer

You can go on dreaming every night
But I'm not letting you out of my sight
I'm-a-ten times the man than any guy around
But you're just itchin'-twitchin'-itchin' for a break

There's too much talking for a night drive
Too much mist in front of my eyes
But I'm helpless in love with you
But you're just looking for a break

Is it love or is it what?...

Truth

(Goldie)

Would you lie to me lately - truth
Would you die for me maybe - truth
Oh these ? ? ? ?

Truth

Tomorrow for you to know
That sorrow hides in sculpture
Truth
If a kiss could cry for you
Honest true
Then set in stone for you
Love me too
I'm ? away in ???? - truth

Would you lie to me lately - truth
Would you die for me maybe - truth
? these ? ?
Though I'd die to know if I choose ?
If I ???
If I could change my ways
Maybe I would
But there's a blind ?
Vision took enlightened me
Kiss the sky for me
And maybe I should
Or should I cry for you?
One day
One way

If a kiss could cry for you
Honest true
Then set in stone for you
Oh love be true
I'll set a light in me by your truth
But I'd die to know
Yeah I'd die to know

Would you lie to me lately - truth
Would you die for maybe - truth
All these ??? of ?
Tomorrow for you to know
That sorrow hides in sculpture
Tomorrow for you to know
That sorrow hides in sculpture




Trying To Get To Heaven

(Bob Dylan)

The air is getting hotter
There's a rumbling in the skies
I've been wading through the high muddy water
With the heat rising through my eyes
Every day your memory grows dimmer
It doesn't hurt me like it did before
I've been walking through the middle of nowhere
Trying to get to heaven before they close the door
Oh yeah

People on the platforms
Waiting for the trains
I can hear their hearts a-beatin'
Like pendulums swinging on a chain
When you think you've lost everything
You find out you can always lose a little more
I'm just going down that road feeling bad
Trying hard to get to heaven
Before they close the door

CHORUS (x4)
  Oooh, trying to get to heaven
  Before they close the door

I'm going down the river
Going down to New Orleans
They tell me everything's gonna be all right
But I don't know what "all right" even means
I close my eyes and I wonder boys
If everything is as hollow as it seems
I been to Sugar Town and shook the sugar down
Trying to get to heaven before they close the door
Hey-hey!

CHORUS (repeat ad inf.)
  Oooh, trying to get to heaven
  Before they close the door




Tumble And Twirl

(Iggy Pop/David Bowie)

I've seen the city
I took the next flight for Borneo
They say it's pretty
I like the tee shirts in Borneo
Some wear Bob Marley
Others in Playboy or Duvalier
Make the last plane come
Let me rise through the cloudy above
With a book on Borneo

Strangers come and go
It's such a waste of time
Problems far behind
Another day
But even in spring-time
It's a rich slice of life
So send me a letter
I'll reply with a broken spear
That dusky Mulatto
In nylons and tattoos
Hot juice in Coke bottles
We dance in the sand
Well, they twirl and they tumble

Yes, they twirl and they tumble
Well, I'll twirl and I'll tumble
I've been to Leon's
He's got nine daughters
And a stereo
They say that Leon
Watches from the tree tops
In Borneo
When the road is mud
Everything stops with a thud
That's the way it goes down yonder in Borneo
Far beneath his mansion
There's an open drain
Sending all the sewage down the hill
But when the General shows movies
No one hesitates
To sneak from the jungle
They laugh and they mumble
Enjoying the show
And that dusky Mulatto

Hot juice in Coke bottles
In blue jeans and tattoos
Well, they twirl and they tumble
Yes, they twirl and they tumble
Well, I'll twirl and I'll tumble

I like the free world
They say it's pretty
This time of year
They tumble and twirl
They tumble and twirl
I'll tumble and twirl

They twirl and they tumble
They twirl and they tumble

I like the free world
I like the free world

They say it's pretty

This time of year
This time of year




Turn Blue

(Lyrics: Iggy Pop/Walter Lacey. Music: David Bowie/Warren Peace)

See a black Eldorado
Rolling along down below my window
That black girl in the back looks pretty good
Christ! She's beautiful
You know how soft she is
I know just what it'd feel like
I'm so far away from her
Jesus, this is Iggy

You might as well
Come with me
Then you ride
There's talk
And I don't wanna talk
Oh momma
I shot myself down
Oh momma
I shot myself down
Ohhh, momma
I shot myself down
Oooh, momma
Did I tell you
I shot myself down

They're stepping on our hearts    (stepping on our hearts)
Stepping on our hearts
I don't know why
They're stepping on our hearts    (stepping on our hearts)
Stepping on our hearts
Damn, I don't know why
They're stepping on our hearts
Stepping on our hearts (x4)
Can't you see
Stepping on our hearts

How come the blacks
How come they come to you so good?
They get off on you so sexually
If you wanna make it
Young man, you've gotta make somebody come
Come out of you black
Come out of you black and strong
Black and strong
Black and strong
Black
Strong
Black

Jesus it's cold in this room
You know I, I never told you 'bout this
But there's one guy - somebody I really love
He's never around
We'd take things that could be alright, that could be nice
And make 'em so ugly, so damned ugly
And we put out the lights on'm
We make it dark, we put out the lights!
On them
It's idiots like you that screw me up
I know there's nothing to you
And I don't know why I treat you so kind
Up, down and dance with me
Dance with me
You got nobody left but me
Accept me
Don't reject me
Don't forget me

Momma
What colour will the lights be?
Will they turn blow on me?
Momma
What colour will the lights be?
Will they turn blue on me?
Momma    (will they turn blue on me)
I shot myself up
Oh momma
I shot myself    (up, up, up, up, up, up)
Momma
I shot myself up    (up, up, up, up, up)
Momma
I shot myself up
Down
Up
Down
Momma
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Momma
I didn't know what I was doing
I didn't mean to
But I did
Shot myself

  One of these nights I may just
  Jump down that rainbow way, be with my baby then
  We'll spend some time together

Twentieth Century Boy

(Marc Bolan)

Ohhhhhhh!

Friends say it's fine
Friends say it's good
Everybody says it's just like Robin Hood
I walk like a rat
Crawl like a cat
Sting like a bee
Babe I'm gonna be your man

And it's plain to see
You were meant for me
Yeah, I'm your toy
Your 20th Century boy

Friends say it's fine
Friends say it's good
Everybody says it's just like Robin Hood
Fly like a plane
Drive like a car
Ball like a hound
Babe I'm gonna be your man

And it's plain to see
You were meant for me
Yeah, I'm your toy
Your 20th Century boy
20th Century boy, I wanna be your toy (x4)

Uncle Arthur

 

Strikes the bell for 5 o'clock, Uncle Arthur closes shop
Screws the tops on all the bottles, turns the lights out, locks it up
Climbs across his bike and he's away
Cycles past the gas works, past the river, down the high street
Back to mother, it's another empty day

Uncle Arthur likes his mummy
Uncle Arthur still reads comics
Uncle Arthur follows Batman

Round and round the rumours fly, how he ran away from mum
On his 32nd birthday, told her that he'd found a chum
Mother cried and raved and yelled and fussed
Arthur left her no illusion, brought the girl round, save confusion
Sally was the real thing, not just lust

Uncle Arthur vanished quickly
Uncle Arthur and his new bride
Uncle Arthur follows Sally

Round and round goes Arthur's head, hasn't eaten well for days
Little Sally may be lovely, but cooking leaves her in a maze
Uncle Arthur packed his bags and fled
Back to mother, all's forgiven, serving in the family shop
He gets his pocket money, he's well fed

Uncle Arthur past the gas works
Uncle Arthur past the river
Uncle Arthur down the high street
Uncle Arthur follows mother




Uncle Floyd

 

Oogie: "I was just thinking. Did you ever stop and think if there wasn't an Uncle Floyd show what everyone on the show would be doing?"

Uncle Floyd: "Why Oogie I think about that all the time."

Oogie: "I was thinking about it. Take Skip for instance. He wouldn't have anything to worry about he always had a good job as a radio announcer and he would of been in showbiz anyway.

"How about Mugsy? Mugsy would never have to worry he's a musician he could always work as a musician.

"And Netto? Netto wouldn't worry. He wouldn't even notice the show was off the air.

"And how about Charlie? He wouldn't have to worries. He still lives at home.

"Nah, and how about Scott? He would sit home around the home all day and wait till silent movies came back.

"And I was thinking, thinking about you Uncle F. What would you do?"


Oogie waits just another day
Drags his bones to see the Yankees play
Bones Boy talks and flickers grey
Oh, they slip away

Slip away

Once a time they nearly might have been
Bones and Oogie on a moving screen
No one knew what they could do
Except for me and you
They slip away
They slip away

Oogie knew there's never ever time
Some of us will always stay behind
Down in space it's always 1982
The joke we always knew
Oo-oo
What'sa matter with you?
C'mon, let's go
Slip away
Oo-o

(Chorus)
    Don't forget to keep your head warm
    Twinkle twinkle Uncle Floyd
    Watching all the world and war torn
    How I wonder where you are?
    Ohhh-oo
    Sailing over Coney Island
    Twinkle twinkle Uncle Floyd
    We were dumb but you were fun, boy
    How I wonder where you are?

Oh-o-o

(Recorded for the planned March 2001 unreleased album Toy. The song was later reworked and released as Slip Away and appeared on Heathen).





Under Pressure

(David Bowie / Freddie Mercury / John Deacon / Roger Taylor / Brian May)

Bah, bah, bah, bah, bah, bah, bah, bah
Bah, bah, bah, bah, bah, bah

Pressure, pushing down on me
Pressing down on you, no man ask for
Under pressure, that burns a building down
Splits a family in two
Puts people on streets

Bah, bah, bah, bah, bah, bah
Bah, bah, bah, bah, bah, bah

That's okay
It's the terror of knowing
What this world is about
Watching some good friends
Screaming "Let me out"
Pray tomorrow takes me higher
Pressure on people, people on streets

Doh doh doh bah bah bah bah
Okay
Chipping around, kick my brains around the floor
These are the days it never rains but it pours
People on streets, people on streets

It's the terror of knowing
What this world is about
Watching some good friends
Screaming "Let me out"
Pray tomorrow take me higher
Pressure on people, people on streets

Turned away from it all, like a blind man
Sat on a fence but it don't work
Keep coming up with love
But it's so slashed and torn
Why why why?
Love love love love

Insanity laughs, under pressure we're cracking
Can't we give ourselves one more chance
Why can't we give love one more chance
Why can't we give love, give love, give love, give love, give love

'Cos love's such an old fashioned word
And love dares you to care
For the people on the edge of the night
And love dares you to change our way of
Caring about ourselves

This is our last dance (x 2)
This is ourselves
Under pressure
Under pressure
Pressure




Under The God

 

Skin dance back-a-the condo
Skinheads getting to school
Beating on Blacks with a baseball bat
Racism back in rule

White trash picking up Nazi flags
While you was gone, there was war
This is the West, get used to it
They put a swastika over the door

CHORUS
  Under the God
  Under the God
  One step over the red line
  Under the God
  Under the God
  Ten steps over the crazy crazy

Washing their heads in the toilet bowl
They don't see supremacist hate
Right wing dicks in their boiler suits
Picking out who to annihilate

Toxic jungle of Uzi trail
Tribesmen just wouldn't live here
Fascist flare is fashion cool
You're dead - you just ain't buried (yet)

  Under the God
  Under the God
  Oh yeah
  Under the God
  Under the God

As the walls came tumbling down
Though the secrets that we share
I believed you by the palace gate
But now the savage days are here

Under the Gods
Crazy eyed man with a shotgun
Hot headed creep with a knife
Love and peace and harmony
Love you could cut with a life

CHORUS




Underground

 

No one can blame you
For walking away
But too much rejection
No love injection
Life can't be easy
It's not always swell
But don't tell me truth hurts, little girl
'Cos it hurts like hell (echo)
But down in the underground (oh oh oh oh oh)
You'll find someone true (down underground)
Down in the underground (oh oh oh oh oh)
A land serene (oh oh oh oh)
A crystal moon, ah, ah

It's only forever
Not long at all
The lost and lonely
That's underground
Underground

Daddy, daddy, get me out of here (heard about a place today)
I, I'm underground (nothing never hurts again)
Heard about a place today (daddy, get me out of here)
Where nothing never hurts again (wanna go underground)
Daddy, daddy, get me out of here (wanna go underground)
I, I'm underground (get me underground)
Sister, sister, please take me down (daddy, get me out of here)
I, I'm underground (wanna go underground)
Daddy, daddy, get me out of here

No one can blame you
For walking away
Too much rejection
No love injection
But down in the underground (oh oh oh oh oh)
You'll find someone true (down underground)
Down in the underground (oh oh oh oh oh)
A land serene (oh oh oh oh)
A crystal moon, ah, ah

It's only (echo)
It's only forever
It's not long at all
The lost and lonely

Daddy, daddy, get me out of here
Heard about a place today (heard about a place today)
Nothing never hurts again (nothing never hurts again)

Untitled No. 1

 

In mornings she's so regal that the valley sighs
In the chilly sea that killed her real slow
Now we're swimming up farther with the doll by our sides
Fill the cup with these sleepy souls

CHORUS
  Sleepy Kapoor
  It's clear that some things never take
  Sleepy Kapoor
  Please, heal these tears
  Sleepy Kapoor

She will feel like at tea, make me laugh all along
With such feats like sex only brought upon
Oh lady, oh baby, maybe I'll live my lies alone
Jesus, up here, hear me, I, up-up-up above

CHORUS

Please heal these tears

CHORUS repeat

Some things never
Never never




Unwashed and Somewhat Slightly Dazed

 

Spy, spy, pretty girl
I see you see me through your window
Don't turn your nose up
Well, you can if you need to, you won't be the first or last
It must strain you to look down so far from your father's house
And I know what a louse like me in his house could do for you
I'm the cream
Of the Great Utopia dream
And you're the gleam
In the depths of your banker's spleen

I'm a phallus in pigtails
And there's blood on my nose
And my tissue is rotting
Where the rats chew my bones
And my eye sockets empty
See nothing but pain
I keep having this brainstorm
About twelve times a day
So now, you could spend the morning walking with me, quite amazed
As I'm unwashed and somewhat slightly dazed

I got eyes in my backside
That see electric tomatoes
On credit card rye bread
There are children in washrooms
Holding hands with a Queen
And my heads full of murders
Where only killers scream
So now you could spend the morning talking with me quite amazed
As I'm raving mad and somewhat slightly dazed

Now you run from your window
To the porcelain bowl
And you're sick from your ears
To the red parquet floor
And the Braque on the wall
Slides down your front
And eats through your belly
It's very catching
So now, you should spend the morning lying to your father quite amazed
About the strange unwashed and happily slightly dazed
Oh - o - yea' - oh - (purr) - oooh! - dar-nah-nah-naru - na




Up The Hill Backwards

 

Vacuum created by the arrival of freedom
And the possibilities it seems to offer
It's got nothing to do with you, if one can grasp it
It's got nothing to do with you, if one can grasp it

A series of shocks - sneakers fall apart
Earth keeps on rolling - witnesses falling
It's got nothing to do with you, if one can grasp it
It's got nothing to do with you, if one can grasp it

Yeah, yeah, yeah - up the hill backwards
It'll be alright ooo-ooo

While we sleep they go to work
We're legally crippled it's the death of love
It's got nothing to do with you, if one can grasp it
It's got nothing to do with you, if one can grasp it

More idols than realities, ooo-ooo
I'm OK, you're so-so, ooo-ooo

Yeah, yeah, yeah - up the hill backwards
It'll be alright ooo-ooo




Up The Hill Backwards - (earlier version)

It's got nothing to do with you, if one can grasp them
It's got nothing to do with you, if one can grasp them

We All Go Through

(David Bowie/Reeves Gabrels)

Skeletal city highs
Crazies with dumb replies
Nobody's eyes anymore

Frown on your beggar's face
Walking this lunarscape
Nothing in my lack-a-day

CHORUS
  We'll all be right
  We'll all be right
  We'll all be right in the now
  We all go through
  We all go through
  We all go through it sometimes

Somebody's space to rent
Somebody's soul to dent
Dog is in every word

Hiding the flames of power
Hiding the zone by hour
Nearly got out yesterday

CHORUS

Trouble it travels on the wing
Doorway to door
Open your eyes
Nothing remains
A secret love between us

Nothing can hide for long
We are the morning song
Holding my breath anyway

CHORUS (x2)




We Are Hungry Men

 

(Spoken):
Here is the news...
According to the latest world population survey
Figures have reached danger point, my God
London: Fifteen million seventy-five thousand
New York: Eighty million
Paris: Fifty million and thirty
China: One-thousand million
Billington Spa: Lots

My studies included exophagy
I formed my own society
To crush the power of fecundity
The world will overpopulate
Unless you claim infertility
So who will buy a drink for me, your Messiah

We are not your friends
We don't give a damn for what you're saying
We're here to live our lives

I propose to give the pill
Free of charge to those that feel
That they are not invertible
The crops of few, the cattle gone
There's only one way to linger on
So who will buy a drink for me, your Messiah

We are not your friends
We don't give a damn for what you're saying
We're here to live our lives

(spoken)
Achtung, achtung, these are your orders...
Anyone found guilty of consuming more than their allotted amount of air
Will be slaughtered and cremated
Only one cubic foot of air is...

I prepared a document, legalising mass abortion
We will turn a blind eye to infanticide

We are not your friends
We don't give a damn for what you're saying
We're here to live our lives

You don't seem to hear me clear
Do I talk above your sphere?
Let me explain my project dear
Show you how I'll save the world
Or let it die within the year
Why do you look that way at me, your Messiah

We are not your friends
We don't give a damn for what you're saying
We're here to live our lives

We are hungry men
We don't give a damn for what you're saying
We're here to eat you!




We Are The Dead

 

Something kind of hit me today
I looked at you and wondered if you saw things my way
People will hold us to blame
It hit me today, it hit me today

We're taking it hard all the time
Why don't we pass it by?
Just reply, you've changed your mind
We're fighting with the eyes of the blind
Taking it hard, taking it hard

Yet now
We feel that we are paper, choking on you nightly
They tell me "Son, we want you, be elusive, but don't walk far"
For we're breaking in the new boys, deceive your next of kin
For you're dancing where the dogs decay, defecating ecstasy
You're just an ally of the leecher
Locator for the Virgin King, but I love you in your fuck-me pumps
And your nimble dress that trails
Oh, dress yourself, my urchin one, for I hear them on the rails
Because of all we've seen, because of all we've said
We are the dead

One thing kind of touched me today
I looked at you and counted all the times we had laid
Pressing our love through the night
Knowing it's right, knowing it's right

Now I'm hoping someone will care
Living on the breath of a hope to be shared
Trusting on the sons of our love
That someone will care, someone will care

But now
We're today's scrambled creatures, locked in tomorrow's double feature
Heaven's on the pillow, its silence competes with hell
It's a twenty-four hour service, guaranteed to make you tell
And the streets are full of press men
Bent on getting hung and buried
And the legendary curtains are drawn 'round Baby Bankrupt
Who sucks you while you're sleeping
It's the theatre of financiers
Count them, fifteen 'round a table
White and dressed to kill

Oh caress yourself, my juicy
For my hands have all but withered
Oh dress yourself my urchin one, for I hear them on the stairs
Because of all we've seen, because of all we've said
We are the dead
We are the dead
We are the dead

(Recorded during the Diamond Dogs sessions at the Olympic Studios, Barnes, London SW13 in 1974).





We Prick You

(Lyrics: David Bowie. Music: David Bowie/Brian Eno)

White boys falling on the fires of night
  (I wish you'd tell, I wish you'd tell)
Flesh punks burning in their glue
Revolution comes in the strangest way
  (I wish you'd tell, I wish you'd tell)
I'd rather be inside you

CHORUS 1 (twice)
  Tell the truth
  Tell the truth
  Tell the truth
  We prick you, we prick you, we prick you

CHORUS 2 (twice)
  You show respect even if you disagree
  You show respect

Mama can I kiss you? Daddy can I tell?
  (we wish you well)
Innocence passed me by
I wanna be screwing when the nightmare comes
  (I wish you well, I wish you well)
I wanna come quick and die

CHORUS 1 (twice)
CHORUS 2

All the little rose-kissed foxy girls
  (Shoes, shoes, little white shoes)
Where have all the flowers gone?
All the little fragile champion boys
  (Toys, toys, little black toys)
Dripping on the end of a gun

Even if you disagree

CHORUS 1 (twice)

  You show respect even if you disagree
  You show respect
  You show respect

Shoe, shoe, little white shoe
Wish you well, wish you well
Toy, toy, little black toy
Wish you well, wish you well
Shoe, shoe, little white shoe
Wish you well, wish you well




We Shall Go To Town

(David Bowie/Reeves Gabrels)

No more delight
Or crawling around
Whisper the word
Hold my hand
Never forget
Those who refuse you
Never forget
Who you've been
And you will fight with demons
When we shall go to town
And we'll eat between the rich men
And we'll drink if we don't go down

Follow the lights
Stay on the outside
The only way in
Is swollen with tears
Don't bring your things
Just let me serve you
Only the fool turns around
And you will fight with demons
When we shall go to town
And you will wear your best shoes
And we'll dance if we don't go down
And we'll dance if we don't go down




Weeping Wall

 



(Recorded during the Low sessions at The Chateau, Paris, France and Hansa Tonstudio, Berlin, Germany in 1976-1977).





What'd I Say

(???)

 


(Performed live by Davy Jones and The Manish Boys).





What Kind Of Fool Am I?

(Anthony Newley/Leslie Bricusse)

What kind of fool am I, who never fell in love?
It seems that I'm the only one I have been thinking of
What kind of man is this? An empty shell, a lonely cell
In which an empty heart must dwell?
What kind of lips are these that lied with every kiss?
That whispered empty words of love that left me alone like this?
Why can't I fall in love like any other man?
And maybe then I'll know what kind of fool I am
What kind of clown am I? What do I know of life?
Why can't I cast away the mask of play and live my life?
Why can't I fall in love, till I don't give a damn?
And maybe I'll know what kind of fool I am

(Performed live by David Bowie and The Buzz).





What In The World

 

You're just a little girl with grey eyes
Never mind, say something
Wait until the crowd cries
Oh, wait until the crowd cries
You're just a little girl with grey eyes

So deep in your room, you never leave your room
Something deep inside of me - yearning deep inside of me
Talking through the gloom
What in the world can you do
What in the world can you do
I'm in the mood for your love
For your love
For your love
For your love - oh

I'm just a little bit afraid of you
'Cos love won't make you cry
But, wait until the crowd goes
Oh, wait until the crowd goes
I'm just a little bit afraid of you

So deep in your room, you never leave your room
Something deep inside of me - yearning deep inside of me
Is talking through the gloom
What in the world can I do
What in the world can I do
I'm in the mood for your love
For your love
For your love
For your love

Ohh, what you gonna say?
Ohh, what you gonna do?
Ahh, what you gonna be?
To the real me - to the real me
I'm just a cool
Under the cool, and I'm fighting a wall
What you gonna say to the real me, to the real me?
Ahhhh, ahhhh, ahhhh, ahhhh, ahhhh (fade.)

(Recorded during the Low sessions at The Chateau, Paris, France and Hansa Tonstudio, Berlin, Germany in 1976-1977).





What's Really Happening

(Lyrics: David Bowie / Alex Grant. Music: David Bowie / Reeves Gabrels)

VERSE (x2)
  Grown inside a plastic box
  Micro thoughts and safety locks
  Hearts become outdated clocks
  Ticking in your mind

CHORUS
  What's really happening  What tore us apart
  What's really happening

  What's really happening  What tore us apart
  What's really happening

Now it's time to close our eyes
Now it's time to say goodbye
Now it's time to face the lie
That we'd never cry

CHORUS

All the clouds are made of glass
And they're slowly sinking
Falling like the shattered past
Were we built to last?

CHORUS




When I Live My Dream

 

When I live my dream, I'll take you with me
Riding on a golden horse
We'll live within my castle, with people there to serve you
Happy at the sound of your voice

Maybe, I'll slay a dragon for you
Or banish wicked giants from the land
But you will find, that nothing in my dream can hurt you
We will only love each other as forever
When I live my dream

When I live my dream, I'll forgive the things you've told me
And the empty man you left behind
It's a broken heart that dreams, it's a broken heart you left me
Only love can live in my dream

I'll wish, and the thunder clouds will vanish
Wish, and the storm will fade away
Wish again, and you will stand before me while the sky will paint an overture
And trees will play the rhythm of my dream

When I live my dream, please be there to meet me
Let me be the one to understand
When I live my dream, I'll forget the hurt you gave me
Then we can live in our new land

Till the day my dream cascades around me
I'm content to let you pass me by
Till that day, you'll run to many other men
But let them know it's just for now
Tell them that I've got a dream
And tell them you're the starring role
Tell them I'm a dreaming kind of guy
And I'm going to make my dream
Tell them I will live my dream
Tell them they can laugh at me
But don't forget your date with me
When I live my dream

(German version entitled Mit Mir In Deinem Traum recorded at Trident Studios, Soho, London on 29th January 1969, to be used for an appearance on German television. Part German-English lyrics. Different version also recorded for 'The Looking Glass Murders' production for Scottish TV. Recorded at The Gateway Theatre, Edinburgh, Scotland on 1st February 1970).





When The Wind Blows

(David Bowie/Erdal Kizilcay)

So long child, I'm on my way
And after all is done, after all is done
Don't be down, it's all in the past
Though you may be afraid

So long child, it's awful dark
And I've never felt the sun
I dread to think of when
When the wind blows

When the wind blows (x3)

Life burns a savage wound, angry and wrong
Trusting a twisted word, you'll run, run away
You'll take him home
You'll spit and taunt him
But they won't believe you
No matter what you'll say

So long child, it's awful dark
I never felt the sun
I dread to think of when
When the wind blows

When the wind blows (x3)




When The Boys Come Marching Home

 

How to make amends for the things they said
The girls avoid the stormy skull
But I and my cloudy face
Will be gone, high-tailing out of here
Is the lights a-blazing in their lonely town?
I love the little cars at dawn
But time and my heaving heart
Will be lain upon some foreign shore
Here's the saddest Joe on the corner of the town
"Listen to the words!" he cries
I love him in his craziness, his tatters and his courage
He'll thumb his nose at the straight and true

When the boys come marching home
They'll fly his rags from the highest tree
When the boys come marching home
  (When the boys come marching home)
  (Home, marching home)

Aching for some innocence and peace of mind
While the moon pulls up its net of souls
The sun presses down on my brave new world
But in truth, I don't feel brave at all
Leave it all behind me to the townies and the wags
The kids who never learnt to smile
While I and the cobbled nag I ride
Stumble down another weary mile
Here's to those who cluster
Walking through the wars
The girls who never closed 'til dawn
They rag upon the feeble
And they swan around the stronger
But their eyes are fixed on the edge of town
When the boys come marching home
They'll slide from view - tiny, two by two

When the boys come marching home
  (Home, marching home)
  (Home, marching home)
When the boys come marching home
  (When the boys come marching home)
Boys come marching home
  (Home, marching home)
  (Home, when the boys come marching home)
  (Home, marching home)
  (Home)
  (When the boys come marching home)




Where Have All The Good Times Gone!

(Ray Davies)

In my life I've never stopped to worry about a thing
Opened up and shouted out and never tried to see
Wondering if I'd done wrong
Will this depression last for long?

CHORUS
  Won't you tell me
  Where have all the good times gone
  Where have all the good times gone
  Where have all the good times gone

Once we had an easy ride and always felt the same
Time was on our side and I had everything to gain
Let it be like yesterday
Please let me have happy days

Ma and Pa looked back on all the things they used to do
Didn't have no money and they always told the truth
Daddy didn't have no toys
And Mummy didn't need no boys

CHORUS

Yesterday was such an easy game for you to play
But let's face it things are so much easier today
Guess you need some bringing down
And get your feet back on the ground

CHORUS




White Light/White Heat

(Lou Reed)

VERSE 1
White light - White light gonna drive me out of my brain
White light - White light gonna make me feel so insane
White heat - White shapin' them down to my toes
White light - White light's got it now goodness knows

VERSE 2 White light - White light gonna drive me out of my mind
White light - White light's surely gonna make me blind
White heat - White shaping way down to my toes
White light - White light could kill me now goodness knows

CHORUS
Oh Oh, White light
Oh Oh, White light
Oh Oh, White heat
Oh Oh, White heat

VERSE 1
VERSE 2
CHORUS (x2)

White light's a-flashing

White light
Still feels right
What's that sound, what's that sound
Don't turn on, be dead or alive
No feeling
Here she comes
Oww, yeah
(Oh, oh, oh, oh) here she comes
(Oh, oh, oh, oh)
(Ah, ah, ah, ah)

Within You

 

How you turned my world, you precious thing
You starve and near exhaust me
Everything I've done, I've done for you
I move the stars for no one
You've run so long
You've run so far
Your eyes can be so cruel
Just as I can be so cruel
Though I do believe in you
Yes I do
Live without the sunlight
Love without your heartbeat
I, I can't live within you
I can't live within you
(sigh)
I, I can't live within you




Without You I'm Nothing

(Placebo)

Strange infatuation seems to grace the evening tide
I'll take it by your side
Such imagination seems to help the feeling slide
I'll take it by your side
Instant correlation sucks and breeds a pack of lies
I'll take it by your side
Oversaturation curls the skin and tans the hide
I'll take it by your side

Tick - tock (3 times)
Tick - tick - tick - tick - tick - tock - tick

I'm unclean, a libertine
And every time you vent your spleen
I seem to lose the power of speech
You're slipping slowly from my reach
You grow me like an evergreen
You never see the lonely me at all

I...
Take the plan, spin it sideways
I...
Fall
Without you, I'm nothing
Without you, I'm nothing
Without you, I'm nothing
Take the plan, spin it sideways
Without you, I'm nothing at all

(Also performed live with Placebo at The Irving Plaza, New York City on 29th March 1999).





Word On A Wing (1976 Live bonus track)

 

In this age of grand delusion, you walked into my life out of my dreams
I don't need another change, still you forced your way into my scheme of things
You say we're growing, growing heart and soul
In this age of grand delusion, you walked into my life out of my dreams
Oh sweet name, you're born once again for me
Oh sweet name, you're born once again for me
Oh sweet name, I call you again  (you're born once again for me)
Just because I believe don't mean I don't think as well
Don't have to question everything in heaven or hell

CHORUS
  Lord I kneel and offer you, my word on a wing
  And I'm trying hard to fit among your scheme of things
  It's safer than a strange land, though I still care for myself
  And I don't stand in my own light
  Lord, ohh Lord, my prayer flies like a word on a wing
  My prayer flies like a word on a wing
  Does my prayer fit in with your scheme of things?

In this age of grand delusion you walked into my life out of my dream
Oh sweet name, you're born once again for me
Yea' sweet name, you're born once again for me
Just as long as I can see I'll never stop this vision flowing
I look twice and you're still glowing
Just as long as I can walk I'll walk beside you, I'm alive in you
Oh sweet name, you're born once  (you're born once again)
An' I'm ready to shape the scheme of things, oh I'm ready

Ready to shape the scheme of things
Ooh I'm ready, I'm ready, ready
Ohhh I'm ready to shape the scheme of things
Oo I'm ready, ready, ready
Ohhhhh....

Lord I kneel and offer you, my word on a wing
And I'm trying hard to fit among your scheme of things
It's safer than a strange land, though I still care for myself
And I don't stand, in my own light
Oh Lord, Lord, Lord I offer you, my word on a wing
And I'm trying hard to fit among your scheme of things
It's safer than a strange land, though I still care for myself
And I don't stand in my own light
Oh Lord, oh Lord, my prayer flies like a word on a wing
My prayer flies like a word on a wing
Does my prayer fit in with your scheme of things?
Ooooo-ooo-oooo

(Live from Nassau Veterans' Memorial Coliseum, Uniondale, USA, 23rd March 1976).





Yassassin

 

CHORUS
  Yassassin - I'm not a moody guy
  Yassassin - I walk without a sound
  Yassassin - Just a working man, no judge of men
  Yassassin - But such a life I've never known

We came from the farmlands
To live in this city
We walked proud and lustful
In this resonant world
You want to fight
But I don't want to leave
Or drift away

CHORUS

Look at this - no second glances
Look at this - no value of love
Look at this - just sun and steel
Look at this - then look at us

If there's someone in charge
Then listen to me
Don't say nothing's wrong
'Cos I've got a love
And she's afeared
You want to fight
But I don't want to leave
Or drift away

CHORUS

Yassassin, Yassassin, Yassassin



You Can't Sit Down


Hey pretty baby! (you can't sit down)
A don't you hear the drummer thumpin' (you can't sit down)
You gotta shake it like a crazy (you can't sit down)
Because the band is sayin' something (you can't sit down)
And everybody is a jumpin'(you can't sit down)
You gotta slop, bop, flip flop, hip hop
Never stop
(You can't sit down, you can't sit down)

You gotta move, move, move, a round and round (1)
(You can't sit down, you can't sit down)
You gotta fly, fly, fly, way off the ground
You're puttin' down, a crazy, shout
No, no, you can't sit down, no, no, you can't sit down

When you're on South Street (you can't sit down)
And the band is really bootin' (you can't sit down)
You hear the hip beat with the back beat (you can't sit down)
And you see the gang a groovin' (you can't sit down)
You gotta get your bottom movin' (you can't sit down)
You gotta make it, break it, shake it all around
You can't sit down, you can't sit down


You can't sit down, you can't sit down, you can't sit down
You can't sit down, you can't sit down, you can't sit down
You can't sit down, you can't sit down, you movin' em down
A crazy shout, you can't sit down

A, yea, yea, yea, hey pretty baby
You know you really dance so fine now
You're really shakin' like a crazy
A don't you down lead the line now
We're gonna do it one more time now
You got to make it, break it, shake it, all around
(You can't sit down, you can't sit down)


(You can't sit down, you can't sit down)
You gotta move, move, move, a round and round
(You can't sit down, you can't sit down)
You gotta fly, fly, fly, way off the ground


You Got To Have A Job (If You Don't Work - You Can't Eat) / Hot Pants

They say you got to get a job
To put meat on the table
You got to get a job
To keep your family able

They say you got to get a job
To put shoes on your feet
You got to get a job
To make your life complete

You don't work, you can't eat
You don't work, you can't eat
You don't work, you can't eat
You don't work, you can't eat

1917

(David Bowie/Reeves Gabrels)




1984

 

Someday they won't let you, now you must agree
The times they are a telling, and the changing isn't free
You've read it in the tea leaves, and the tracks are on TV
Beware the savage lure
Of 1984

They'll split your pretty cranium and fill it full of air
And tell that you're eighty, but brother you won't care
You'll be shooting up on anything, tomorrow's never there
Beware the savage lure
Of 1984

(Chorus)
  Come see, come see, remember me?
  We played out an all night movie role
  You said it would last, but I guess we enrolled
  In 1984 (who could ask for more)
  1984 (who could ask for mor-or-or-or-ore)
  (Mor-or-or-or-ore)

I'm looking for a vehicle, I'm looking for a ride
I'm looking for a party, I'm looking for a side
I'm looking for the treason that I knew in '65
Beware the savage lure
Of 1984

(Chorus)

1984
1984
1984 (more)
1984
1984 (more)
1984

(Recorded during the Diamond Dogs sessions at the Olympic Studios, Barnes, London SW13 in 1974).





1984/Dodo

 

Someday they won't let you, but now you must agree
The times they are a telling, and the changing isn't free
You've read it in the tea leaves, the tracks are on TV
Beware the savage lure
Of 1984

They'll break your pretty cranium, and fill it full of air
And tell you that you're eighty, but lover you won't care
You'll be shooting up as usual like tomorrow wasn't there
Beware the savage lure
Of 1984

Come see, come see, remember me?
We played at an all night movie role
You said it would last, but I guess we rolled
In 1984 (who could ask for more)
1984 (who could ask for more)

Now we can talk in confidence
Did you guess that we've been done wrong?
Lies jump in queue to be first in line
Such a shameless design

He thinks he's well screened from the man at the top
It's a shame that his children disagree
They coolly decide to sell him down the line
Daddy's brainwashing time

He's a dodo, no no, didn't hear it from me (didn't hear it from me)
He's a dodo, no no, didn't hear it from me (didn't hear it from me)

She's doesn't recall her blessed childhood of yore
When a unit was a figure, not a she
When lovers chose each other seems the perks are due
Another memo to screw

She's a dodo, no no, didn't hear it from me (didn't hear it from me)
She's a dodo, no no, didn't hear it from me (didn't hear it from me)

Can you wipe your nose my child
Without them slotting in your file a photograph?
Will you sleep in fear tonight?
Wake to find the scorching light of neighbour Jim
He's come to turn you in

Another dodo, no no, didn't hear it from me (didn't hear it from me)
Another dodo, no no, didn't hear it from me (didn't hear it from me)
Another dodo, no no, didn't hear it from me (didn't hear it from me)

Come see, come see, remember me?
We played at an all night movie role
You said it would last, but I guess we enrolled
In 1984, who could ask for more
1984, who could ask for mor-or-or-or-ore
Mor-or-or-or-ore

1984
1984 (who could ask for more)
1984
1984 (who could ask for more)
1984
1984 (who could ask for more)
1984
Ooooo

5:15 The Angels Have Gone

 

5:15
I'm changing trains, this little town
Let me down
This foreign rain brings me down
5:15
Train overdue, angels have gone
No ticket
I'm jumping tracks, I'm changing towns
We never talk anymore
Forever I will adore only you

5:15
All of my life, angels have gone
I'm changing trains
Angels like them, thin on the ground
All of my life
All legs and wings, strange sandy eyes

5:15
Train overdue, angels have gone
We never talk anymore
Forever
I will adore only you
Cold station
All of my life
Forever
I'm out of here forever




'87 And Cry

 

It's just a one dollar secret
A lover's secrets in the UK
Torn apart in the UK
In the dribble of May Day
'87 and cry
'87 and cry
And there's nothing inside
And there's nothing in mind, no-oh
And only you
Rocket on thru' the sky
Well it couldn't be done without dogs
And it couldn't be once without us
'87 and cry
'87 and cry

When the days were the days were the days boys
When blue ties were for the big guys
Frannie dressing down for the enemy
You saw him hangin' on the enemy
And there's no one in love
And there's nowhere to scream, no-oh
And only you
Race on to wonder where
Well it couldn't be done without dogs
No it couldn't be once without us
'87 and cry
'87 and cry
You can't make love with money
You can't make mistakes with babies
Nothing looked good on you
That's how I liked you best
Now you're ready for the real McCoy

Deep in the heart of Cupid
Murder on the heels of love
Just the ghost of a story
It's just a one dollar secret
   Baby these were the sounds
   Baby these were the sounds, yeah
And only you
Whisper these things aren't true
But it couldn't be done with dogs
Well it couldn't be once without us
('87 and cry)
'87 and cry
'87 and cry
'87 and cry, cry, cry
'87 and cry
'87 and cry, cry, cry
'87 and cry
'87 and cry, cry, cry, cry, cry
'87 and cry, cry, cry, cry
'87 and cry
'87 and cry
'87 and cry
'87 and cry
Hey, hey

A Better Future

 

Please don't tear this world asunder
Please take back this fear we're under
I demand a better future
Or I might just stop wanting you
I might just stop wanting you

Please make sure we get tomorrow
All this pain and all this sorrow
I demand a better future
Or I might just stop needing you
I might just stop needing you

Give my children sunny smiles
Give them room and cloudless skies
I demand a better future
Or I might just stop loving you, loving you, loving you

When we talk, we talk to you
When we walk, we walk to you
From factory to field
How many tears must fall?
Down there below
Nothing is moving

I might just stop wanting you
I might just stop needing you
I might just stop loving you
I demand a better future
I demand a better future
I demand a better future
Or I might just stop loving you
Loving you, loving you

I demand a better future
I demand a better future
I demand a better future
Or I might just stop loving you
Loving you, loving you
I demand a better future




A Big Hurt

 

For Michelle

To meet her once just to know it through and through
I know, I know
But it ain't finished till the fat lady sings
I know, I know

How can I help you?
You're just a wanna-be
I'm a believer
You're a sex receiver
And me with a big hurt
You know I had a big hurt
From the very start
I'm hurting so bad
'Cos you're my room mate from hell

(Chorus)
  Got to take some blows on the stepping stones
  Speak in extremes
  It'll save you time
  You were a Saint abroad
  But a devil at home
  Come on here, woo-woo
  And kiss it for me

To meet her once is just to know it through and through
I know, I know
Even a glass eye in a duck's ass can see that
I know, I know

How can I help you?
I'm hit with a big hurt
You know I had
A great big hurt
From the very start
I'm hurting so bad
And here come the Indians oooo!

(Chorus)

Kiss it for me, woo-woo
Kiss it for me
Woo-woo, kiss it for me
Come on here, woo-woo
Kiss it for me
Kiss it where it counts
Kiss it for me
Come on here, woo-woo
Woo-woo, woo-woo, woo-woo, woo-woo
Kiss it for me

I know

A Small Plot Of Land

(Lyrics: David Bowie. Music: Bowie/Eno/Gabrels/Garson/Kizilcay/Campbell)

Poor soul
Spit upon that
Poor soul
He never knew what hit him
And it hit him so

Poor dunce
He pushed at the pigmen
The Barbs laughed
The fool is dead

Poor dunce
He's less than within us
The brains talk
But the will to live is dead
And prayer can't travel so far these days
The talk of your life
Standing so near
To innocent eyes
Poor dunce

Swings through the tunnels
And claws his way
Is small life so manic
Are these really the days?

Poor dunce
Poor dunce

Poor soul
Spit upon that
Poor soul
He never knew what hit him
And it hit him so
He pushed back the pigmen
Poor soul
Poor soul
Poor soul
Poor soul
Poor, poor soul
Poor, poor, poor (etc)




Abdulmajid





(Recorded during the "Heroes" sessions at Hansa Tonstudio, Berlin, Germany in 1977. Previously untitled until Ryko release, Abdulmajid is Iman's maiden name).





Absolute Beginners

 

I've nothing much to offer
There's nothing much to take
I'm an absolute beginner
But I'm absolutely sane
As long as we're together
The rest can go to hell
I absolutely love you
But we're absolute beginners
With eyes completely open
But nervous all the same

(Chorus)
  If our love song
  Could fly over mountains
  Could laugh at the ocean
  Just like the films
  There's no reason
  To feel all the hard times
  To lay down the hard lines
  It's absolutely true

Nothing much could happen
Nothing we can't shake
Though we're absolute beginners
With nothing much at stake
As long as you're still smiling
There's nothing more I need
I absolutely love you
But we're absolute beginners
Well if my love is your love
We're certain to succeed

(Chorus)
  If our love song
  Could fly over mountains
  Could sail over heartache
  Just like the films
  If there's reason
  To feel all the hard times
  To lay down the hard lines
  It's absolutely true





Across The Universe

(John Lennon/Paul McCartney)

Words are flowing out like endless rain into a paper cup
They slither wildly as they slip away
Across the universe
Pools of sorrow, waves of joy are drifting through my opened mind
Possessing and caressing me

(Chorus 1 - 2 times)
  Nothing's gonna change my world
  Nothing's gonna change my world

Images of broken light which dance before me like a million eyes
They call me on and on
Across the universe
Thoughts meander like the restless wind inside a letter box
They tumble blindly as they make their way
Across the universe

CHORUS 1 (twice)

Sounds of laughter, shades of life are ringing through my open ears
Inciting and inviting me
Limitless undying love, which shines around me like a million suns
It calls me on and on and on
Across the universe

(Chorus 1 - 3 times)

(Chorus 2 - 2 times)
  Nothing
  Nothing
  Nothing
  Nothing's gonna
  Nothing's gonna to change my world

(Chorus 3)
  Nothing's gonna change it
  Nothing's gonna change it

Hey

(Chorus 3 - 2 times)

Nothing's gonna change my world

(Chorus 3)

Nothing's gonna change my world




Afraid

 

I wish I was smarter
I got so lost on the shore
I wish I was taller
Things really matter to me

But I put my face in tomorrow
I believe we're not alone
I believe in Beatles
I believe my little soul has grown
And I'm still so afraid
Yes, I'm still so afraid
Yea, I'm still so afraid on my own
On my own

What made my life so wonderful?
What made me feel so bad?
I used to wake up the ocean
I used to walk on clouds

If I put faith in medication
If I can smile a crooked smile
If I can talk on television
If I can walk an empty mile
Then I won't feel afraid
No, I won't feel afraid
I won't be
Be afraid
Anymore




African Night Flight

(Lyrics: David Bowie. Music: David Bowie/Brian Eno)

African nightmare one-time Mormon
More men fall in Hullabaloo men
I slide to the nearest bar
Undermine chairman I went too far
Bent on a windfall rent a Sony
Wonder how the dollar went down?
Gotta get a word to Elizabeth's father
Hey ho, he wished me well

CHORUS 1 (two times)
  Seemed like another day
  I could fly into the eye of God on high

CHORUS 2 (two times)
  His burning eye will see me through
  One of these days, one of these days
  Gotta get a word through one of these days

CHORUS 3 (two times)
  Asanti habari habari habari
  Asanti nabana nabana nabana

Getting in mood for a Mombassa night flight
Pushing my luck, gonna fly like a mad thing
Bare strip take-off skimming over Rhino
Born in slumber less than peace
Struggle with a child whose screaming dreaming
Drowned by the props all steely sunshine
Sick of you, sick of me
Lust for the free life
Quashed and maimed
Like a valuable loved one
Left unnamed

CHORUS 1 (two times)

Over the bushland over the trees
Wise like Orangutan that was me

CHORUS 2 (two times)

CHORUS 3 (repeat ad inf.)

(Recorded during the Lodger sessions at Mountain Studios, Montreux, Switzerland in 1979).





After All

 

Please trip them gently, they don't like to fall, Oh by jingo
There's no room for anger, we're all very small, Oh by jingo
We're painting our faces and dressing in thoughts from the skies, from paradise
But they think that we're holding a secretive ball
Won't someone invite them
They're just taller children, that's all, after all

Man is an obstacle, sad as the clown, Oh by jingo
So hold on to nothing, and he won't let you down, Oh by jingo
Some people are marching together and some on their own
Quite alone
Others are running, the smaller ones crawl
But some sit in silence, they're just older children
That's all, after all

I sing with impertinence, shading impermanent chords
With my words
I've borrowed your time and I'm sorry I called
But the thought just occurred that we're nobody's children at all, after all

Live till your rebirth and do what you will, Oh by jingo
Forget all I've said, please bear me no ill, Oh by jingo
After all, after all




After Today

 

Always in trouble
Never to blame
Must be your double
Feeling the same
Here it comes again

Doing the wrong thing
Forgetting your lines
Waiting for something
Better to shine
Hate that same old game

After today - fortune then will find you
After today - plane will fly you away
After today - you'll find the one you're after
After today - look out, after today

What kind of rescue?
What will you be?
Where can you take it baby for free?
Break that heart for me!

(Chorus)
  After today - the fortune fan will find you
  After today - they may pry you away
  After today - you'll find the one you're after
  After today - look out, after today

(Chorus)
  After today - the fortune fan will find you
  After today - they will pry you away
  After today - you'll find the one you're after
  After today - look out, after today

Today
After today
After today, hey
Look out, after today
Ah, yeah
Look, ah (laughter)
(Spoken: "I was getting into that")

Aladdin Sane (1913-1938-197?)

 

Watching him dash away, swinging an old bouquet - dead roses
Sake and strange divine
Uh-h-h-uh-h-uh you'll make it
Passionate bright young things, takes him away to war - don't fake it
Saddening glissando strings
Uh-h-h-uh-h-uh - you'll make it

Who will love Aladdin Sane
Battle cries and champagne just in time for sunrise
Who will love Aladdin Sane

Motor sensational, Paris or maybe hell - I'm waiting
Clutches of sad remain
Waits for Aladdin Sane - you'll make it

Who will love Aladdin Sane
Millions weep a fountain, just in case of sunrise
Who will love Aladdin Sane

Will love Aladdin Sane
Who'll love Aladdin Sane

Who will love Aladdin Sane
Millions weep a fountain, just in case of sunrise
Who will love Aladdin Sane

Will love Aladdin Sane
Will love Aladdin Sane

Say the lights are oh so bright on Broadway




Algeria Touchshriek

(Lyrics: David Bowie. Music: Bowie/Gabrels/Garson/Kizilcay/Campbell)

My name is Mr. Touchshriek
Of Touchshriek with mail over and fantasy
My shop sells egg shells off the shesores and empty females

I'm thinking of leasing the room above my shop
To a Mr. Walloff Domburg
A reject from the world wide intellect

He's a broken man
I'm also a broken man

It would be nice to have company
We could have great conversations
Looking through windows for demons
And watching the young advance in all electric

Some of the houses around here still have inhabitants in them
I'm not sure if they're from this country or not
I don't get to speak much to anyone or, that sort of thing
If I had another broken man
Oh, I dream of something like that




All Saints








All The Madmen

 

Day after day
They send my friends away
To mansions cold and grey
To the far side of town
Where the thin men stalk the streets
While the sane stay underground

Day after day
They tell me I can go
They tell me I can blow
To the far side of town
Where it's pointless to be high
'Cos it's such a long way down

So I tell them that
I can fly, I will scream, I will break my arm
I will do me harm
Here I stand, foot in hand, talking to my wall
I'm not quite right at all... am I?

Don't set me free, I'm as heavy as can be
Just my librium and me
And my E.S.T. makes three

'Cos I'd rather stay here
With all the madmen
Than perish with the sad men roaming free
And I'd rather play here
With all the madmen
For I'm quite content they're all as sane
As me

(Where can the horizon lie
When a nation hides
Its organic minds
In a cellar...dark and grim
They must be very dim)

Day after day
They take some brain away
Then turn my face around
To the far side of town
And tell me that it's real
Then ask me how I feel

Here I stand, foot in hand, talking to my wall
I'm not quite right at all

Don't set me free, I'm as helpless as can be
My libido's split on me
Gimme some good old lobotomy

'Cos I'd rather stay here
With all the madmen
Than perish with the sad men
Roaming free
And I'd rather play here
With all the madmen
For I'm quite content
They're all as sane as me

Zane, Zane, Zane

Almost Grown

(Chuck Berry)

Yeah 'n' I'm doin' all right in school
They ain't said I broke no rule
I ain't never been in Dutch
I don't browse around too much

Don't bother me, leave me alone
Anyway I'm almost grown

I don't run around with no mob
Got myself a little job
I'm gonna buy me a little car
Drive my girl in the park

Got my eye on a little girl
Ah, she's really out of this world
When I take her to the dance
She's got to talk about romance

You know I'm still livin' in town
But I done married and settled down
Now I really have a ball
So I don't browse around at all




Always Crashing In The Same Car

 

Every chance, every chance that I take
I'll take it on the road
With kilometers and the red light
I was always looking left and right
Oh, but ?
Always crashing in the same car

Jasmine, I saw you peeping
As I pushed my foot down to the floor
I was going, round and round, the hotel garage
Must have been touching close to ninety-four
Oh, but I'm always crashing in the same car

Yeah

(Recorded during the Low sessions at The Chateau, Paris, France and Hansa Tonstudio, Berlin, Germany in 1976-1977).





Amazing

(David Bowie/Reeves Gabrels)

I'm lazy
You crazy, girl
Stay by my side

I'm scared you'll
Meet someone
In whom you'll confide
No, no, no

CHORUS
  Life's still a dream
  Your love's amazing
  Since I found you
  My life's amazing

I pledge you'll
Never be blue
There's too much at stake to be down
My nightmare
Rooted here watching you go
Divine in both our lives

  Life's still a dream
  Your love's amazing
  Amazing
  Since I found you
  My life's a roll

Go, go, go
And it's amazing
It's amazing
Go, go, go
It's amazing
Ow, ow, ow
Go, go, go
Ow, ow
It's amazing




America

(Paul Simon)

"Let us be lovers we'll marry our fortunes together"
"I've got some real estate here in my bag"
So we bought a pack of cigarettes, Mrs. Wagner pies
Walked off to look for America

"Kathy," I said as we boarded a Greyhound in Pittsburgh
"Michigan seems like a dream to me now"
It took me four days to hitch-hike from Saginaw
I've gone to look for America

Laughing on the bus
Playing games with the faces
She said the man in the gabardine suit was a spy
I said "Be careful his bow tie is really a camera"

"Toss me a cigarette, I think there's one in my raincoat"
She said "We smoked the last one an hour ago"
So I gazed at the scenery, she read her magazine
And the moon rose over an open field

"Kathy I'm lost" I said, though I knew she was sleeping
I'm empty and aching and I don't know why
Counting the cars on the New Jersey Turnpike
They've all come to look for America
They've all come to look for America
All come to look for America


(First song of the 'Concert for New York City' benefit gig in New York City at Madison Square Garden on 20th October 2001).





Amlapura

(David Bowie/Reeves Gabrels)

(Also version done in Indonesian)

Hey-hey it's the tall sail
On a beach reach for Java
Make way for to Java
Watching for Boogies
Hey-hey it's a dreaming
I would burn you if you should die
Hey-hey I would burn too
If you should lie upon that bamboo pyre

CHORUS
  I dream of Amlapura
  Never saw in all my life a more shining jewel
  I dream of Amlapura
  Of an ocean or dream of a Princess in stone

Hey-hey golden roses around
A Rajah's mouth
Hey-hey all the dead children buried standing
A flying Dutchman
Smoking gun and spice wind

CHORUS

I dream of Amlapura
Of a Princess in stone
Hey-hey it's a tall ship
Hey-hey
Hey-hey
Amlapura




Amlapura - (Indonesian version)

(David Bowie/Reeves Gabrels. Translated: ?)

Hey, hey, ada kapal layar
Menuju Jawa
Dari jalan ke Jawa jaga-jaga
Jika ada orang Bugis

Hey, hey, ini mimpi
Kukan bakarmu jika kau harus pergi
Hey, hey, kubakan
Maka diriku
Jika kau baring di balai bambu

Kumimpi tentang Amlapura
Tak pernah kulihat permata seindah ini
Kumimpi tentang Amlapura
Lautan atau mimpi
Tentang patung putri

Hey, hey, patung raja
Dikalungi mawar emas
Hey, hey, kanak-kanak, tewas di tempat
Oleh bedil-Belanda
Dari kapal letaknya

Kumimpi tentang Amlapura
Tak pernah kulihat permata seindah ini
Kumimpi tentang Amlapura
Lautan atau mimpi
Tentang patung putri

Kumimpi tentang Amlapura
Tentang patung putri

Hey, hey, ada kapal layar

Kumimpi tentang Amlapura
Atas deknya dan kapal tempatnya
Dari jalan ke Jawa
Dari jalan ke Jawa




Amsterdam

(Jacques Brel/Mort Schumann)

In the port of Amsterdam
There's a sailor who sings
Of the dreams that he brings
From the wide open sea
In the port of Amsterdam
There's a sailor who sleeps
While the river bank weeps
To the old Willow tree

In the port of Amsterdam
There's a sailor who dies
Full of beer, full of cries
In a drunken town fight
In the port of Amsterdam
There's a sailor who's born
On a hot muggy morn
By the dawn's early light

In the port of Amsterdam
Where the sailors all meet
There's a sailor who eats
Only fish heads and tails
And he'd show you his teeth
That have rotted too soon
That can haul up the sails
That can swallow the moon

And he yells to the cook
With his arms open wide
"Hey, bring me more fish
Throw it down by my side"
And he wants so to belch
But he's too full to try
So he stands up and laughs
And he zips up his fly

In the port of Amsterdam
You can see sailors dance
Paunches bursting their pants
Grinding women to porch
They've forgotten the tune
That their whiskey voice croaked
Splitting the night
With the roar of their jokes
And they turn and they dance
And they laugh and they lust
Till the rancid sound of the accordion bursts
And then out of the night
With their pride in their pants
And the snot that they tow
Underneath the street lamp

In the port of Amsterdam
There's a sailor who drinks
And he drinks and he drinks
And he drinks once again
He'll drink to the health
Of the whores of Amsterdam
Who've given their bodies
To a thousand other men
Yeah, they've bargained their virtue
Their goodness all gone
For a few dirty coins
When he just can't go on
Throws his nose to the sky
Aims it up above
And he pisses like I cry
On the unfaithful love

In the port of Amsterdam
In the port of Amsterdam




An Occasional Dream - (demo)

 

I recall how we lived
On the corner of the bed
And we'd speak of a Swedish room
Of hessian and wood
And we'd talk with our eyes
Of the sweetness in our lives
And tomorrow's of rich surprise
Some things we could do
For you and me tomorrow

In our madness
We burnt one hundred days
Time takes time to pass
And I still hold some ashes to me
An occasional dream

And we'd sleep, oh so close
But not really close our eyes
'Tween the sheets of Summer bathed in blue
Gently weeping nights
It was long, long ago, long ago
And I still can't touch your name

For the days of fate were strong for you
Danced you far from me
Just you and you tomorrow

In my madness
I see your face in mine
I keep a photograph
It burns my wall with time
Time
An occasional dream
Of mine
An occasional dream
Of mine
An occasional dream
Of mine

(Appears on a demo tape recorded by David Bowie and John 'Hutch' Hutchinson in April 1969).

And I Say To Myself

 

And I say to myself

She is a playgirl
She the wrong wrong girl for me
And I say to myself
You're a fool, fool, fool
She doesn't love you

Andy Warhol

 

Like to take a cement fix
Be a standing cinema
Dress my friends up just for show
See them as they really are
Put a peephole in my brain
Two new pence to have a go
I'd like to be a gallery
Put you all inside my show

CHORUS
  Andy Warhol looks a scream
  Hang him on my wall
  Andy Warhol, silver screen
  Can't tell them apart at all

Andy walking, Andy tired
Andy take a little snooze
Tie him up when he('s) fast asleep
Send him on a pleasant cruise
When he wake up on the sea
Be sure to think of me and you
He'll think about paint and he'll think about glue
What a jolly boring thing to do

  Andy Warhol looks a scream
  Hang him on my wall
  Andy Warhol, silver screen
  Can't tell them apart at all

(Chorus repeat)




Angel, Angel, Grubby Face

 

(Partial lyrics)

It's thirteen miles to Factory Street, the train is going soon
Angel, angel, grubby face, I love you, do you love me?
Sunday Oak tree, sing me a song
The cobbles of town are lost in your branches
Monday morning, buses and smoke, workshop and counter, disorder and vouchers

(Believed to have been recorded in March 1968. The demo appeared on the reverse side of a 'London Bye, Ta Ta' EMIDISC acetate, which was offered for sale at Christie's auction house in 1993).





Anyway, Anyhow, Anywhere

(Pete Townsend/Roger Daltrey)

CHORUS
  I can go anyway (way I choose)
  I can live anyhow (win or lose)
  I can go anywhere (for something new)
  Anyway, anyhow, anywhere I choose

Do anything (right or wrong)
I can talk anyhow (and get along)
I don't care anyway (I never lose)
Anyway, anyhow, anywhere I choose

Nothing gets in my way
Not even locked doors
Don't follow the lines that been laid before
I get along anyway I care
Anyway, anyhow, anywhere

CHORUS
  I can go anyway (way I choose)
  I can live anyhow (win or lose)
  I can do anything (for something new)
  Anyway, anyhow, anywhere I choose

Anyway, anyway I choose
I wanna go
Do it myself, do it myself, do it myself, do it myself
Anyway, anyway I choose

As The World Falls Down

 

There's such a sad love
Deep in your eyes, a kind of pale jewel
Open and closed within your eyes
I'll place the sky within your eyes

There's such a fooled heart
Beating so fast in search of new dreams
A love that will last within your heart
I'll place the moon within your heart

CHORUS
  As the pain sweeps through
  Makes no sense for you
  Every thrill has gone
  Wasn't too much fun at all
  But I'll be there for you-oo-oo
  As the world falls down

Falling
(As the world) Falling down
Falling in love

I'll paint you mornings of gold
I'll spin you Valentine evenings
Though we're strangers till now
We're choosing a path between the stars
I'll leave my love between the stars

CHORUS

Falling
(As the world) Falling down
Falling
As the world falls down
Falling
Falling
Falling
Falling in love
As the world falls down
(down) Falling
Falling
Falling
Falling in love
As the world falls down

Falling
Falling
Falling

Makes no sense at all
Makes no sense to fall
Falling
As the world falls down
Falling
Falling
Falling in love
As the world falls down
(down) Falling
Falling
Falling in love
Falling in love (love)
Falling in love
Falling in love
Falling in love




Ashes To Ashes

 

Do you remember a guy that's been
In such an early song
I've heard a rumour from Ground Control
Oh no, don't say it's true

They got a message from the Action Man
"I'm happy, hope you're happy too
I've loved all I've needed love
Sordid details following"

The shrieking of nothing is killing
Just pictures of Jap girls in synthesis
And I ain't got no money and I ain't got no hair
But I'm hoping to kick but the planet is glowing

  Ashes to ashes, funk to funky
  We know Major Tom's a junky
  Strung out in heaven's high
  Hitting an all-time low

Time and again I'll tell myself
I'll stay clean tonight
But the little green wheels are following me
Oh no, not again
"I'm stuck with a valuable friend
I'm happy, hope you're happy too"
One flash of light but no smoking pistol

I've never done good things
I've never done bad things
I never did anything out of the blue, woh-o-oh
Want an axe to break the ice
Wanna come down right now

  Ashes to ashes, funk to funky
  We know Major Tom's a junky
  Strung out in heaven's high
  Hitting an all-time low

My mama said to get things done
You'd better not mess with Major Tom
My mama said to get things done
You'd better not mess with Major Tom
My mama said to get things done
You'd better not mess with Major Tom
My mama said to get things done
You'd better not mess with Major Tom




Baal's Hymn

(Bertolt Brecht. Translation: Dominic Muldowney)

Whilst his mother's womb contained the growing Baal
Even then the sky was waiting quiet and pale
Naked, young, immensely marvellous
Like Baal loved it, when he came to us

That same sky remained with him in joy and care
Even when Baal slept peaceful and unaware
At night a lilac sky, a drunken Baal
Turning pious as the sky grows pale

So through hospital, cathedral, whiskey bar
Baal kept moving onwards and just let things go
When Baal's tired, boys, Baal cannot fall far
He will have his sky down there below

When the sinners congregate in shame together
Baal lay naked, revelling in their distress
Only sky, a sky that will go on forever
Formed a blanket for his nakedness

And that lusty girl, the world, who'll laughing yield
To the men who'll stand the pressure of her thighs
Sometimes gave him love-bites, such as can't be healed
Baal survived it, he just used his eyes

And when Baal saw lots of corpses scattered round
He felt twice the thrill, despite the lack of room
"Space enough" said Baal, "then I'll thicken the ground
Space enough within this woman's womb"

Any vice for Baal has got its useful side
It's the man who practices it, he can't abide
Vices have their point, once you see it as such
Stick to two for one will be too much

Slackness, softness are the sort of things to shun
Nothing could be harder than the quest for fun
Lots of strength is needed and experience too
Swollen bellies can embarrass you

Under gloomy stars and this poor veil of tears
Baal will graze a pasture till it disappears
Once it's been digested to the forest's teeth
Baal trod singing for a well earned sleep

Baal can spot the vultures in the stormy sky
As they wait up there to see if Baal will die
Sometimes Baal pretends he's dead, but vultures swoop
Baal in silence dines on vulture-soup

When the dark womb drags him down to its prize
What's the world still mean to Baal, he's overfed
So much sky is lurking still behind his eyes
He'll just have enough sky when he's dead

Once the Earth's dark womb engulfed the rotting Baal
Even then the sky was up there, quiet and pale
Naked, young, immensely marvellous
Like Baal loved it when he lived with us

(Recorded for 1982 BBC TV production of Baal).





Baby

(Iggy Pop/David Bowie)

Baby
Don't you cry
Baby
I'll sing you a lullaby

We're walking down the
Street of chance
Where the chance is always
Slim or none
And the intentions unjust

Baby there's nothing to see
I've already been
Down the street of chance

Baby you're so clean
Baby please stay clean
Baby you're so young
Baby please stay young
Baby, don't you cry
Baby, we've already cried




Baby Can Dance

 

I'm rolling out of the ferris wheel
No one looks and no one feels
But the baby can the baby can

The way it feels just feeling you
Holding out and falling out
But the baby can the baby can

CHORUS
  I'm the jumping man
  I'm the jumping man
  But baby can float
  Baby can drown
  Baby can touch her toes
  Toss her hair
  Makes you feel you're going nowhere
  Baby can dance
  Baby can dance
  Baby can walk around the town
  Attract a man and cut him down

I'm the shadow man the jumping jack
The man who can and don't look back
But the baby can the baby can

I'm rolling out of the ferris wheel
No one looks and no one feels
But the baby can the baby can

CHORUS

And the way it feels
I'm feeling you

Every day is far away
Every day, every day
It's over now
It's over now

CHORUS




Baby Grace (A Horrid Cassette)

(Lyrics: David Bowie. Music: Bowie/Gabrels/Garson/Kizilcay/Campbell)

Test, testing, testing
This and, Grace is my name
And.. and I was... erm...
It was like phot... a fading photograph of
A patch, a patchwork quilt.
And they've put me on these
Ramona put me on these interest drugs
So I'm thinking very f..., too, a bit too fast like a brain patch
And, er... they won't let me see anybody
If I want to sometimes and I ask
I can still hear some pop... popular musics
And aftershocks
I feel a bit... (sneeze)
I've been watching a television of um... in the homelands
That's the new homelands, and, erm, and that's all I can remember
And now, they just want me to be quiet
And this I think, something is going to be horrid




Baby It Can't Fall

(Iggy Pop/David Bowie)

You have loved me with energy
Backed up with hard work and guts
We inhabit eternity
We fly forever in space

The way we run together
The way we breeze the miles
We put our heads together
And laughingly we smile

It can't fall
It can't fall
Baby, it can't fall
Death means nothing at all

It can't fall
It can't fall
Baby, it can't fall
Our love will outlive this earth

Words have so many meanings
Sometimes mean nothing at all
Sometimes I feel so simple
I don't know what's coming next

We have swum in the ocean
And that was really alright
I'm not a big man
It's hard to face the world

It can't fall
It can't fall
Baby, it can't fall
Death means nothing at all

It can't fall
It can't fall
Baby, it can't fall
Our love will outlive this earth

It can't fall

Failures as fathers, Mothers to chaos
No baby, no baby, no baby no

  Hallo humans can you feel me thinking
  I assume you're seeing everything I'm thinking
  Hallo humans nothing starts tomorrow
  I'm the baby now

It doesn't matter I've seen everything anyway

Failures as fathers, mothers to chaos
No baby, no baby, no baby no

Back To Where You've Never Been

(Tony Hill)

 


(Recorded with Turquoise on 24th October 1968 at Trident Studios. This along with 'Ching-A-Ling' was slated for a release on the Regal Zonophone label in early December 1968).





Ballad Of The Adventurers

(Bertolt Brecht. Translation: Dominic Muldowney)

Sickened by sun, with rainstorms lashing him rotten
A looted wreath crowning his tangled hair
Every moment of his youth apart from its dream was forgotten
Gone the roof overhead, but the sky was always there

Oh you, who are flung out, alike from heaven and from Hades
You murderers who've been so bitterly repaid
Why did you part from the mothers who nursed you as babies
It was peaceful and you slept and there you stayed

Still he explores and rakes the Absinthe green oceans
Though his mother has given him up for lost
Grinning and cursing with a few odd tears of contrition
Always in search of that land where life seems best

Loafing through hells and flocked through paradises
Calm and grinning, with a vanishing face
At times he still dreams of a small field he recognises
With a blue sky overhead and nothing else

(Recorded for 1982 BBC TV production of Baal).





Bang Bang

(Iggy Pop/Ivan Kraal)

(Spoken) 'Now, this ain't the right thing to do... so... so let's... so let's go'

Young girls I know what they're after
Young girls don't kiss me goodbye
Rockets shooting up into space
Buildings they rise to the skies

Bang bang - I got mine
Bang bang - reach for the sky

I keep a good friend on video tape
He'll drive his sports car until it's too late
But we'll have a hot time on the town tonight
'Cause love is my bet and it's the best yet

Bang bang - I got mine
Bang bang - sun don't shine
Bang bang - you all angels
Bang bang - now you all oughta be in pictures

Oh girl
Oh girl my problems can't follow me
Phone calls take my machine
I wander lonely to the sea
Lonely - ha ha ha - what does it mean?

Bang bang - I got mine
Bang bang - and you are next in line
Bang bang - reach for the sky
Bang bang - the sun don't shine

Rise buildings
Rise to the sky
Oh young girls they know what they're after
I said young girls don't kiss me goodbye

Bang bang - then you close them years and clothes - then you close down
Then you're a big man
Bang bang
Spotted a brat
Just coming first
Bang bang
Prayers have wings
Then you were next in line




Bars Of The County Jail

 

La la la la la la la la (etc)
Gather you all and listen here
I'll tell you a tale if you lend me an ear
I rode a horse through many a town
But the Devil rode me down to the ground
I was to marry a very rich girl
I loved her as only I can
But the Father was shot and his gold was stoled
And now I'm the Devil's man, na na na
And now I sing a tail of woe
Through the bars of the county jail, na la la la la la la la la la

La la la la la la la la (etc)

I walked into the room one night
I found her mother and gun
Well, the man was dead and I kneeled and cried
The Sheriff ran in and said "I'm holding you, son"

La la la la la la la la (etc)

Through the day I sing and play
For time is on my side
But when the moon and stars come out
I lay me down and cry
For the Saviour, Ma I lied
Now I will not have a ride
Beside the window the scaffold was made
On the morrow I will hang

La la la la la la la la (etc)

(Demo track recorded in 1965 appears on Early On 1964-1966).





Battle For Britain (The Letter)

(Lyrics: David Bowie. Music: David Bowie/Reeves Gabrels/Mark Plati)

My, my, the time do fly
When it's in another pair of hands
And a loser I will be
For I've never been a winner in my life

I got used to stressing pain
I used the sucker pills to pity for the self
Oh, it's the animal in me
But I'd rather be a beggarman on the shelf

Don't be so forlorn, it's just the payoff
It's the rain before the storm
On a better day, I'll take you by the hand
And I'll walk you through the doors

Don't be so forlorn, it's just the payoff
It's the rain before the storm
Don't you let my letter get you down
Don't you, don't you, don't you, don't you

My, my, but time do fly
When it's in another pair of pants
And illusion I will be
For I've never been a sinner, la di da

Don't be so forlorn, it's just the payoff
It's the rain before the storm
Don't you let my letter get you down
Don't you, don't you, don't you, don't you

Don't you let my letter get you down, down, down, down
Don't you, don't you, don't you, don't you
Don't you let my letter get you down, down, down, down
Don't you, don't you, don't you, don't you

Down, down, down, down, down, down
Down, down, down, down, down, down
Down, down, down, down, down, down




Be My Wife

 

VERSE
  Sometimes you get so lonely
  Sometimes you get nowhere
  I've lived all over the world
  I've left every place

CHORUS
  Please be mine
  Share my life
  Stay with me
  Be my wife

VERSE

CHORUS

Sometimes you get so lonely

(Recorded during the Low sessions at The Chateau, Paris, France and Hansa Tonstudio, Berlin, Germany in 1976-1977).





Beat Of Your Drum

 

Photograph king, watches you go
Now fashions may change, heaven knows, but you still leave a stain on me

Lowly to go, colours may fade
The seasons may change, weather blows, but you still leave a mark on me

Wrong - negative fades - never the twain, reckless and tame

I like the beat of your drum
I like the look in your eyes
I like to look through your things
I'd like to beat on your drum

I like the smell of your flesh
I like the dirt that you dish
I like the clothes that you wear
I'd like to beat on your drum
I'd beat it, I'd beat it, can't feel it, I feel it

Disco brat - follow the pack
Watching you peel, Heaven knows, prison can't hold all this greedy intention

Lowly need to go - I picture you now
Music may change hi-di-ho keen to follow your nose

Wrong - love out of tune
Sweet is the night, bright light destroys me

I like the beat of your drum
I like to look in your eyes
I like to look through your things
I'd like to beat on your drum

I like the smell of your flesh
I like the dirt that you dish
I like the clothes that you wear
I'd like to beat on your drum
I'd beat it, I'd beat it, can't feel it, I feel it

I'd like to beat on your drum, oh yeah
I'd like to beat on your drum
I'd like your face in the crowd
I'd like to beat on your drum
I'd beat it, I'd beat it, can't feel it, I feel it

Can't beat it, can't beat it, I'd beat it, oh yeah

I'd like to beat on your drum
I'd like to beat on your drum
I'd like to yell it all out
I'd like to beat on your drum
Can't beat it, can't beat it, I feel it, I feel it

I'd like to beat on your drum
I'd like to beat on your drum
I like your face in the crowd
I'd like to beat on your drum
Beat it, can't beat it

Can't beat it, I beat it
Beat it out loud, beat it out in the crowd
Beat it, beat it, beat it, beat it

I'd like to beat on your drum
I'd like to beat on your drum
I'd like to blow on your horn
I'd like to beat on your drum

Ah hit it




Beauty And The Beast

 

Oooooooo...

Weaving down a byroad, singing the song
That's my kind of high rolling gone wrong
My-my
Smile at least
You can't say no to the Beauty and the Beast

Something in the night
Something in the day
Nothing is wrong but darling
Something's in the way
There's slaughter in the air
Protest on the wind
Someone else inside me
Someone could get skinned, how?
My-my
Someone fetch a Priest
You can't say no to the Beauty and the Beast
Darling

My-my
You can't say no to the Beauty and the Beast
(Weakling)
My-my
You can't say no to the Beauty and the Beast

I wanted to believe me
I wanted to be good
I wanted no distractions
Like every good boy should

My-my

Nothing will corrupt us
Nothing will compete
Thank God Heaven left us
Standing on our feet
My-my
Beauty and the Beast

My-my
Just Beauty and the Beast
You can't say no to the Beauty and the Beast
Darling

My-my
My
My-my
My

(Recorded during the "Heroes" sessions at Hansa Tonstudio, Berlin, Germany in 1977).





Because I'm Young

 

(Earlier version of Because You're Young)

Look in my eyes
Nobody home
I can be happy
Dead or alive
People I know, people I love
They could be happy if I were dead or alive

La la la la la la la la la la la laaaaa ahhh
I should be older
Oh oh
I should be older

CHORUS
  Because I'm young - don't mean it's alright
  Because I'm young - don't feel you're over
  'Cos it makes me laugh
  'Cos it takes, a million years
  A million dreams, a million scars

Look in my eyes
Nobody home
I could be happy
Dead or alive
People I know, people I love
They could be happy if I were dead or alive

La la la la la la la la la la la la la laaaaa ahhh

Because You're Young

 

Psychodelicate girl - come out to play
Little metal faced-boy - don't stay away
He's so war-torn and resigned she can't talk anymore
What are they trying to prove?
What would they like to find?

It's love back to front and no sides - like I say
These pieces are broken - like I say
These pieces are broken
Hope I'm wrong but I know

CHORUS
  Because you're young - you'll meet a stranger some night
  Because you're young - what could be nicer for you and it makes me sad
  So I'll dance my life away
  A million dreams, a million scars

He punishes hard - was loving her such a crime?
She took back everything she said
Left him nearly out of his mind
They're people I know - people I love
They seem so unhappy - dead or alive

It's love back to front and no sides - like I say
These pieces are broken - like I say
These pieces are broken
Hope I'm wrong but I know

CHORUS
  Because you're young - you'll meet a stranger some night
  Because you're young - what could be nicer for you and it'll make me sad
  So I'll dance my life away
  A million dreams, a million scars

A million
A million scars
A million
A million dreams
A million (repeat ad inf.)

Betty Wrong

(David Bowie/Reeves Gabrels)

Till the sun blisters and sprays
And every lamb ceases to graze
When the kiss of the comb
Tears my face from the bone

CHORUS
  I'll be your light
  When the shadows fall down the walls
  Then life will be done
  And it just won't matter at all

I was caught from a hand
Nurtured on grime, goodwill and screams
Now your breath fills my step
Now there is you till life is gone

CHORUS

I'll roll your ball
Till the stars can't make me cry
Then life will be done
And it just won't matter at all
Not at all

When the kiss of the comb
Tears my face




Bewitched, Bothered And Bewildered

Big Boss Man

(Luther Dixon/Al Smith)

Big boss man, can't you hear me when I call?
Big boss man, can't you hear me when I call?
You ain't so big, you just tall, that's just about all.

You got me working boss man, a workin' around the clock,
I want a little drink of whiskey, you sure won't let me stop.
Big boss man, can't you hear me when I call?
You ain't so big, you just tall, that's just about all.
I'm gonna get me a boss man, one gonna treat me right,
I work hard in the daytime, sure get drunk at night.
You ain't so big, you just tall, that's just about all.

(Performed live by Davy Jones and The Manish Boys).





Big Brother

 

Don't talk of dust and roses
Or should we powder our noses?
Don't live for last year's capers
Give me steel, give me steel, give me pulsars unreal

He'll build a glass asylum
With just a hint of mayhem
He'll build a better whirlpool
We'll be living from sin, then we can really begin

Please savior, saviour, show us
Hear me, I'm graphically yours

CHORUS
  Someone to claim us, someone to follow
  Someone to shame us, some brave Apollo
  Someone to fool us, someone like you

We want you Big Brother, Big Brother

I know you think you're awful square
But you made everyone and you've been everywhere
Lord, I'd take an overdose if you knew what's going down

CHORUS (3 times)

We want you Big Brother

(Recorded during the Diamond Dogs sessions at the Olympic Studios, Barnes, London SW13 in 1974).

Black Tie White Noise

 

Getting my facts from a Benetton ad
I'm lookin' thru' African eyes
Lit by the glare of an L.A. fire
I've got a face, not just my race, bang bang I've got you babe

Sun comes up and the man goes down
And the woman comes again
Just an hour or so to be safe from fear
Then we jump thru' hoops, we're divisible now, just disappear

We reach out over race and hold each other's hands
Then die in the flames singing "we shall overcome"
Whoa! What's going on?
There'll be some blood no doubt about it
But we'll come thru' don't doubt it
I look into your eyes and I know you won't kill me
You won't kill me
You won't kill me
But I look into your eyes
And I wonder sometimes

Oh Lord, just let him see me
Lord, Lord just let him hear me
Let him call me brother
Let him put his arms around me
Let him put his hands together

Reach over race and hold each other's hands
Walk thru' the night thinking we are the world
Woa! What's going on?
There'll be some blood no doubt about it
But we'll come thru' don't doubt it

I look into your eyes and I know you won't kill me
You won't kill me
You won't kill me
But I wonder why
Yes, and I wonder why sometimes

They'll show us how to break the rules
But never how to make the rules
Reduce us down to witless punks
Fascist cries both black and white, who's got the blood, who's got the gun

Putting on the black tie, crankin' out the white noise

(Just a fool!)




Blackout

 

Oh you, you walk on past
Your lips cut a smile on your face
Your scalding face
To the cage, to the cage
She was a beauty in a cage

Too, too high a price
To drink rotting wine from your hands
Your fearful hands
Get me to a doctor's I've been told
Someone's back in town the chips are down
I just cut and blackout
I'm under Japanese influence
And my honour's at stake

The weather's grim, ice on the cages
Me, I'm Robin Hood and I puff on my cigarette
Panthers are steaming, stalking, screaming

If you don't stay tonight
I will take that plane tonight
I've nothing to lose, nothing to gain
I'll kiss you in the rain
Kiss you in the rain
Kiss you in the rain
In the rain
Get me to the doctor

Get me off the streets (get some protection)
Get me on my feet (get some direction)
Hot air gets me into a blackout
Oh, get me off the streets
Get some protection
Oh get me on my feet (wo-ooh!)

While the streets block off
Getting some skin exposure to the blackout (get some protection)
Get me on my feet (get some direction, wo-ooh!)
Oh get me on my feet
Get me off the streets (get some protection)
In a *? second *  ?  *

(Recorded during the "Heroes" sessions at Hansa Tonstudio, Berlin, Germany in 1977).

A bank to find a loan
'Cos you can't be alone
You dig the mongrels

Bleed Like A Craze, Dad

 

Shine shine shine (x6)

Bleed like a craze, Dad
These are the Krays

Easy come
Come, gather that
Gather valium of your dead man
Walks out the drunk from the jazz

Astral, Kestrel
Fed into the featherfall
Fed him on a pencil carving
You will never get

Shine shine shine
Bleed like a craze, Dad
These are the Krays
Shine shine shine
Bleed like a craze, Dad
These are the Krays

Seek for a leather journey
Never stopped to think about
Hollywood King Kong
Domino on the side

Street light, looking right
Looking to the parlous parlours
Party on the dead
Put a net through his headache

Shine shine shine (x3)

Blee-eed, bleed like a craze, Dad
These are the Krays

Living on a movie
All the Shirley/Charlie films on film
Come together, party
Footnote on the footstone

Shine shine shine
Bleeds like a craze, Dad
These are the Krays

Shine shine shine
Shine shine shine

CHORUS (x6)
  Bleed like a craze, Dad
  These are the Krays

Blue Jean

 

Blue Jean - I just met a girl named Blue Jean
Blue Jean - she got a camouflaged face and no money
Remember they always let you down when you need 'em
Oh, Blue Jean - is heaven any sweeter than Blue Jean
She's got a police bike
She's got turned up nose

Sometimes I feel like
  (Oh, the whole human race)
Jazzin' for Blue Jean
  (Oh, and when my Blue Jean's blue)
Blue Jean can send me
  (Oh, somebody send me)
Somebody send me
  (Oh, somebody send me)

One day I'm gonna write a poem in a letter
One day I'm gonna get that faculty together
Remember like everybody has to wait in line
Blue Jean - look out world you know I've got mine
She got Latin roots
She got everything

Sometimes I feel like
  (Oh, the whole human race)
Jazzin' for Blue Jean
  (Oh, and when my Blue Jean's blue)
Blue Jean can take me
  (Oh, somebody send me)
Somebody send me
  (Oh, somebody send me)

Sometimes I feel like
  (Oh, the whole human race)
Jazzin' for Blue Jean
  (Oh, and when my Blue Jean's blue)
Blue Jean can take me

Somebody save me
  (Oh, somebody send me)

Somebody somebody

Bombers

 

(CHORUS)
  All clear wailed the sirens
  Sunshine on the wasteland
  Old man sitting in the white sand
  Think we're in for a big surprise
  Right between the eyes

Seemed a good idea
To drop a bomb on the wasteland here
Only one man could be seen
And he was old and so serene
Captain sat in his deck chair
And the red light flashed beware
Pilot felt quite big-time
As the bombs sailed through the air
Well, they danced and sang
When the bang went bang
But the light popped out
When the smoke began to clear
It was positively queer

(CHORUS)

"Die" said the General
"Cobblers" said the man
So the Pentagon sent a cable
And the Queen a telegram
A-bombs, H-bombs, even very small ones
Ripped apart that sand
'Til the stench was just revolting
And the sky a greenish tan
Then a soldier said "Sir, there's a crack in the world"
The figures went "squash"
And the bits flew far and wide
How the universe sighed!

(CHORUS twice)

When the smoke had blown away
There was nothing left to view
Except a man dear Lord who looked like you
Floating high up in the sky

Boys Keep Swinging

(Lyrics: David Bowie. Music: David Bowie/Brian Eno)

1-2-3-4
Heaven loves ya
The clouds part for ya
Nothing stands in your way
When you're a boy

Clothes always fit ya
Life is a pop of the cherry
When you're a boy

When you're a boy
You can wear a uniform
When you're a boy
Other boys check you out
You get a girl
These are your favourite things
When you're a boy

Boys
Boys
Boys keep swinging
Boys always work it out

Uncage the colours
Unfurl the flag
Luck just kissed you hello!
When you're a boy

They'll never clone ya
You're always first on the line
When you're a boy

When you're a boy
You can buy a home of your own
When you're a boy
Learn to drive and everything
You'll get your share
When you're a boy

Boys
Boys
Boys keep swinging
Boys always work it out

(Recorded during the Lodger sessions at Mountain Studios, Montreux, Switzerland in 1979).





Break Out

Breaking Glass

(David Bowie/Dennis James Davis/George W. Murray)

Baby, I've been, breaking glass in your room again
Listen

Don't look at the carpet, I drew something awful on it
See

You're such a wonderful person
But you got problems
Oh-oh-oh-oh
I'll never touch you

(Recorded during the Low sessions at The Chateau, Paris, France and Hansa Tonstudio, Berlin, Germany in 1976-1977).

Buddha Of Suburbia

 

Living in lies by the railway line
Pushing the hair from my eyes
Elvis is English and climbs the hills
Can't tell the bullshit from the lies
Screaming along in South London
Vicious but ready to learn
Sometimes I fear that the whole world is queer
Sometimes but always in vain

CHORUS
  So I'll wait until we're sane
  Wait until we're blessed and all the same
  Full of blood, loving life and all it's got to give
  Englishman going insane
  Down on my knees in suburbia
  Down on myself in every way

With great expectations I change all my clothes
Mustn't grumble at silver and gold
Screaming above Central London
Never bored, so I'll never get old

CHORUS

Day after
Day after
Day
Day after
Zane, Zane, Zane
Ouvre le chien
Day after
Day
Day after
Zane, Zane, Zane
Ouvre le chien

Bus Stop

(David Bowie/Reeves Gabrels)

There's a cry that is heard in the city
From Vivian at Pentecost Lane
A shriekin' and dancing till 4 a.m.
Another night of muscles and pain
I love you despite your convictions
Though God never laughs at my jokes

CHORUS
  I'm a young man at odds with the Bible
  But I don't pretend faith never works
  When we're down on our knees
  Prayin' at the bus stop

Now Jesus he came in a vision
And offered you redemption from sin
I'm not sayin' that I don't believe you
But are you sure that it really was him?
I've been told that it could've been blue cheese
Or the meal that we ate down the road
Hallelujah

CHORUS




Buzz The Fuzz

(Paul Conrad Rose)

Once there was a fellow
And his name was Buzz
He was just a rookie cop
Just a baby fuzz

He patrolled the Sunset Strip
In the land of the free
And the home of the hip

He protected you and me from evil women like
Poor Alice D

Alice was the girl
That all good hippies dread
And they called her sweet Alice D'head

Alice it was plain to see was
Full of pot and STP
She'd attract a great big crowd
Because her inner peace was much too loud

Good Buzz did the thing
That all the good fuzz must
Stuck his gun in Alice's back
And said "This is a bust"

Shone the flashlight in her eyes
She began to hypnotise
Buzz said "What a wild sensation"
Guess this must be hallu hallucina cina cina cination  hmmm

Love is so sensational
When you fall in love with eyes dilational  la la
Now they're taking pills and shots
And Buzz is not afraid of Watts

Buzz and Alice D have shown
The way of where the Fuzz might be some day

Buzz is still a cop of course
He's the pusher on the force
He's protecting you and me
From evil women
Like poor Alice D




C'est La Vie

 

Through my window I can see
If the world is there for me
Will my shadow on the floor let me be?
And tomorrow calls my name
But I don't want to go
Through the burning flames of time

C'est la vie
C'est la vie

With my friends I play the tune
Warm and tired within my room
And the crackle of the fire whispered low
Now tomorrow takes my hand
But I don't want to go
Through the burning flames of time

C'est la vie
C'est la vie

How can I sail my good times
Over the waves of sorrow?
Show me tomorrow
Show me tomorrow
So that I will know

La la la la la la la
La la la la la la la
La la la la la la la
La la la

Now tomorrow takes my hand
But I don't want to go
Through the burning flames of time

C'est la vie
C'est la vie

Through the burning flames of time
C'est la vie
C'est la vie




Cactus

(Black Francis)

Sitting here wishing on a cement floor
Just wishing that I had just something you wore

I put it on when I go lonely
Will you take off your dress and send it to me?

I miss your kissin' and I miss your head
And a letter in your writing doesn't mean you're not dead

Just run outside in the desert heat
Make your dress all wet and send it to me

I miss your soup and I miss your bread
And a letter in your writing doesn't mean you're not dead

So spill your breakfast and drip your wine
Just wear that dress when you di yi yi yi yine

D -A -V -I -D

Sitting here wishing on a cement floor
Just wishing that I had just something you wore
So bloody your hands on a cactus tree
Wipe it on your dress and send it to me

Sitting here wishing on a cement floor
Just wishing that I had just something you wore

Can You Hear Me

 

Once we were lovers, can they understand?
Closer than others I was your, I was your man
Don't talk of heartaches, ooh, I remember them all
And I'm taking you out one day, to see if I'm
Faking it all

CHORUS
  Can you hear me?
  Can you feel me inside?
  Show your love, love
  Take it in right (take it in right)
  Take it in right (take it in right)

There's been many others (Oo-oo-oo-oohh) so many times
Sixty new cities, an' what do I, what do I
What do I find?
I want love so badly, I want you most of all
You know, it's harder to take it from anyone
It's harder to fall
Can you hear me call ya?

CHORUS

Well, can you hear me? (yeah)
Can you feel me inside? (I do)
Show your love, show your sweet, sweet love
Show me your love
Take it in right (take it in right)
Take it in right, yeah (take it in right)
Take it in right to your love life, baby

Take it in right to your love life
Take it in right, take it in right, right to your love life
Take it in right, ah
Take it in, take it in right

Right down, right down
  (Why don't you take it?)
Mmmm, why don't you take it?
  (Right to your heart)
Can you hear me?
  (Why don't you take it?)
Can you feel me?
  (Why don't you take it?)
Can you? Take it in right
  (Why don't you take it?)
Wuhh, right down, right down
  (Right to your heart)
Can you take it? Feel me?
  (Why don't you take it?)
Down, to right down
  (Why don't you take it?)
To your heart
  (Why don't you take it?)
To your heart
  (Right to your heart)
Take it down, take it down

  (Why don't you take it? Why don't you take it?)
Take it in right
  (Right to your heart) (Oo-oo-oohh

Can I Get A Witness

(Brian Holland/Lamont Dozier/Eddie Holland)

 

(Cover version of the Marvin Gaye hit performed live by Davie Jones and The King Bees).





Can't Help Thinking About Me

 

Question-time that says I brought dishonour
My head's bowed in shame
It seems that I've blackened the family name
Mother says that she can't stand the neighbours' talking
I've gotta pack my bags, leave this home, start walking, yeah
I'm guilty
I wish that I was sorry this time
I wish that I could pay for my crime

I can't help thinking about me

Remember when we used to go to church on Sunday's
I lay awake at night, terrified of school on Monday's
Oh, but it's too late now
I wish I was a child again
I wish I felt secure again

I can't help thinking about me

As I pass a recreation ground
I remember my friends, always been found and I can't

I can't help thinking about me

Now I leave them all in the Never-Never Land
The station seems so cold, the ticket's in my hand
My girl calls my name "Hi Dave
Drop in, see around, come back
If you're this way again"
Oh, I'm on my own
I've got a long way to go
I hope I make it on my own

I can't help thinking about me




Can't Nobody Love

Candidate

 

I'll make you a deal, like any other candidate
We'll pretend we're walking home 'cos your future's at stake
My set is amazing, it even smells like a street
There's a bar at the end where I can meet you and your friend
Someone scrawled on the wall 'I smell the blood of Les Tricoteuses'
Wrote up scandals in other bars

I'm having so much fun with the poisonous people
Spreading rumours and lies and stories they've made up
Some make you sing and some make you scream
One makes you wish that you'd never been seen
But there's a shop on the corner that's selling papier mache
Making bullet-proof faces, Charlie Manson, Cassius Clay
If you want it, boys, get it here, thing

So you scream out of line
"I want you! I need you! Anyone out there? Anytime?"
Tres butch little number whines "Hey girlie, I want you
When it's good, it's really good, and when it's bad I go to pieces"
If you want it, boys, get it here, thing

On the street where you live I could not hold up my head
For I put all I had in another bed
On another floor, in the back of a car
In a cellar like a church with the door ajar
Well, I guess we must be looking for a different kind
But we can't stop trying 'til we break up our minds
'Til the sun drips blood on the seedy young knight
Who press you on the ground while shaking in fright
I guess we could cruise down one more time
With you by my side, it should be fine
We'll buy some drugs and watch a band
Then jump in a river holding hands

(Recorded during the Diamond Dogs sessions at the Olympic Studios, Barnes, London SW13 in 1974).





Candidate (working lyrics)

 

It's a street - like any other street - with a guillotine on one side - home on the other side

This corridor's amazing they've even built it like this street
This corridor's amazing it even smells like a street
There's a bar at the end where the condemned meet

Someone's scrawled on the wall "I smell the blood of Les Tricoteuses"
Who wrote up the hangings executions scandals up in other bars

I'm having so much fun with the Poisonous People
Spreading rumours and lies and stories they've made up

Some make you sing and some make you scream
One makes you wish that you'd never been seen
But there's a shop boy on the corner that's who's selling papier-mache
Making bullet proof faces Charlie Manson, Cassius Clay

If you want it boys get it here, thing
So you scream out of line I want you - I need you
Anyone out there - anytime any candidates
Then butch little number whines "Hey dirty I want you"
When it's good really good when it's bad I go to pieces
If you want it boys get it here thing

On the street where you live I could not hold up my head
For I've put all I had in another bed
On another floor in the back of a car
In a cellar like a church like with door ajar

I guess we must be looking for a different kind
But we can't stop tryin' till we break up our minds
Till the sun drips blood on the seedy young knight
Who dress you on the ground while shaking in fright

I guess we could cruise down one more time
With you by my side, it should be fine
Buy some drugs and watch a band
Then jump in a river holding hands

(Written during the Diamond Dogs sessions at the Olympic Studios, Barnes, London SW13 in 1974).





Candidate (demo version)

 

Inside every teenage girl there's a fountain
Inside every young pair of pants there's a mountain
Inside every mother's eyes is Tommy Tinkrem's bed
Inside every candidate waits a grateful dead

I make it a thing, when I'm on my own to relieve myself
I make it a thing, when I gazelle on stage to believe in myself
I make it a thing, to glance in window panes and look pleased with myself
Yeah, and pretend I'm walking home

I took it so bad, I sat in the correction room
Took me a fag, and a kick in the moon
Well I, ain't gonna suck no radar wing
'Cos inside this tin is tin
Would you like techno-plate 'cos I'm your candidate, oh yeah

It's a matter of life
And the way you walk, you've got a Brylcream queen
It's a matter of tact
In the things you talk, that keeps his passport clean
A matter of fact
That a cock ain't a cock on a twelve inch screen
So I'll pretend I'm walking home

You don't have to scream a lot to keep an ageing tune
You don't have to scream a lot to predict monsoons
You don't have to paint my contact black
Now I've hustled a pair of jeans
Do I have to give your money back when I'm the Fuhrerling?

I'll make you a deal
I'll say I came from Earth and my tongue is taped
I'll make you a deal
You can get your kicks on the candidate
I'll make you a deal
For your future's sake, I'm the candidate
Let's pretend we're walking home

Uh-huh, uhhh
I'm the candidate
Make way for the candidate
Vote now for the candidate

(Demo version recorded in 1973).





Cat People (Putting Out Fire)

(Lyrics: David Bowie. Music: David Bowie/Giorgio Moroder)

See these eyes so green
I can stare for a thousand years
Colder than the Moon
Well it's been so long

And I've been putting out fire with gasoline

See these eyes so red
Red like jungle burning bright
Those who feel me near
Pull the blinds and change their minds
It's been so long

Still this pulsing night
A plague I call a heartbeat
Just be still with me
Well you wouldn't believe what I've been through
You've been so long
Well it's been so long
I've been putting out fire with gasoline
Putting out fire
With gasoline

See these tears so blue
An ageless heart that can never mend
Tears can never dry
A judgement made can never bend

See these eyes so green
I can stare for a thousand years
Just be still with me
You wouldn't believe what I've been through

Well you've been so long
Well it's been so long
And I've been putting out fire with gasoline
Putting out the fire with gasoline

Putting out fire
Well I've been putting out fire

Well, it's been so long, so long  (so long)
Yes, it's been so long  (so long, so long)
I've been putting out fire
  (Been so long, so long)
I've been putting out fire
  (Been so long, so long)
Putting out fire
  (Been so long, so long)
I've been putting out fire
  (Been so long, so long)
I've been putting out fire
  (Been so long, so long)
Putting out fire
  (Been so long, so long)
Been so long
  (Been so long, so long)
Been so long
  (Been so long, so long)
Putting out fire
  (Been so long, so long)
I've been putting out fire





Changes

 

Low down
Ooo

Still don't know what I was waiting for
And my time was running wild
A million dead-end streets and
Every time I thought I'd got it made
It seemed the taste was not so sweet
So I turned myself to face me
But I've never caught a glimpse
Of how the others must see the faker
I'm much too fast to take that test

Ch-ch-ch-ch-Changes
  (Turn and face the strange)
Ch-ch-Changes
Don't wanna be a richer man
Ch-ch-ch-ch-Changes
  (Turn and face the strange)
Ch-ch-Changes
Just gonna have to be a different man
Time may change me
But I can't trace time

Ooo yeah
I watch the ripples change their size
But never leave the stream
Of warm impermanence and
So the days float through my eyes
But still the days seem the same
And these children that you spit on
As they try to change their worlds
Are immune to your consultations
They're quite aware of what they're going through

Ch-ch-ch-ch-Changes
  (Turn and face the strange)
Ch-ch-Changes
Don't tell them to grow up and out of it
Ch-ch-ch-ch-Changes
  (Turn and face the strange)
Ch-ch-Changes
Where's your shame
You've left us up to our necks in it
Time may change me
But you can't trace time

Strange fascination, fascinating me
Ah changes are taking the pace I'm going through

Ch-ch-ch-ch-Changes
  (Turn and face the strange)
Ch-ch-Changes
Oh, look out you rock 'n rollers
Ch-ch-ch-ch-Changes
  (Turn and face the strange)
Ch-ch-Changes
Pretty soon now you're gonna get older
Time may change me
But I can't trace time
I said that time may change me
But I can't trace time

Chilly Down

 

When the sun goes down (when the sun goes down)
And the bats are back to bed (and the bats are back)
The brothers come 'round (the brothers come 'round)
I get out of my dirty bed (my dirty bed)
I shake my pretty little head (I shake my pretty little head)
Tap my pretty little feet (tap my pretty little feet)
Feeling brighter than sunlight (oh)
Louder than thunder (oh)
Bouncing like a yo-yo, wooh (oh)

Don't got no problems (no problems)
Ain't got no suitcase (no suitcase)
Ain't got no clothes to worry about (no clothes to worry about)
Ain't got no real estate or jewelry or gold mines to hang me up.

I just throw in my hand (throw in my hand)
With the chilliest bunch in the land (in the land)
They don't look much (oh)
They sure chilly chilly (oh)
They positively glow glow, huh (oh)

Chilly down with the fire gang
Think small with the fire gang (It's the only way)
Bad hep with the fire gang (a smile a day keeps the doctor away)
When your thing gets wild
Chilly down

Chilly down with the fire gang (Hey, I'm a wild child)
Act tall with the fire gang (whoo, walk tall)
Good times, bad food (yeah)
When your thing gets wild
Chilly down, chilly down

Drive you crazy, really lazy, eye rollin', funky strollin', ball playin'
Hip swayin', trouble makin', booty shakin', tripping, passing, jumping
Bouncing, drivin', stylin', creeping, pouncing, shoutin', screamin'
Double dealin', rockin', rollin', and a reelin'
With the mackin' sex appealin'.
Can you dig our groovy feelin'?

So when things get too tough (get too tough)
And your chin is dragging on the ground (dragging on the ground)
And even down looks up (down looks up)
Bad luck heh heh
We can show you a good time (show you a good time)
And we don't charge nothin' (nothin' at all)
Just strut your nasty stuff
Wiggle in the middle yeh
Get the town talkin', fire gang

Chilly down with the fire gang (think small)
Think small with the fire gang
Bad hep with the fire gang (hey, listen up)
When your thing gets wild
Chilly down

Chilly down with the fire gang (hey, shake your pretty little head)
Think small with the fire gang (tap your pretty little feet)
Good times, bad food (come on, come on)
When your thing gets wild
Chilly down

Chilly down with the fire gang (wooh)
Think small with the fire gang
Bad hep with the fire gang




China Girl

(Iggy Pop/David Bowie)

Oh oh oh ohhhh, little China Girl
Oh oh oh ohhhh, little China Girl

I could escape this feeling, with my China Girl
I feel a wreck without my, little China Girl
I hear her heart beating, loud as thunder
Saw they stars crashing

I'm a mess without, my little China Girl
Wake up in the morning where's my, little China Girl
I hear her heart's beating, loud as thunder
I saw the stars crashing down

I feel a-tragic like I'm Marlon Brando
When I look at my China Girl
And I could pretend that nothing really meant too much
When I look at my China Girl

I stumble into town, just like a sacred cow
Visions of swastikas in my head
Plans for everyone
It's in the whites of my eyes

My little China Girl
You shouldn't mess with me
I'll ruin everything you are
Y'know, I'll give you television
I'll give you eyes of blue
I'll give you a man who wants to rule the world

And when I get excited
My little China Girl says
"Oh baby just you shut your mouth"
She says... "sh-sh-shhh"
She says... "sh-sh-shhh"
She says
She says

And when I get excited
My little China Girl says
"Oh baby just you shut your mouth"

And when I get excited
My little China Girl says
"Oh baby just you shut your mouth"

She says... "sh-sh-shhh"
She says

Oh oh oh ohhhh, little China Girl
Oh oh oh ohhhh, little China Girl
Oh oh oh ohhhh, little China Girl
Oh oh oh ohhhh, little China Girl




Ching-A-Ling

 

While walking on Red Rooster's lawn
A char-faced man I'd spy
He blew into his handkerchief
And stuttered as he sighed
I wish I'd play the doo-dah horn
The doo-dah horn is fine
I'd sell my house and ferny coach
To make this daydream mine

Doo-dah doo, doo-dah (etc)

Whilst flying through an azure cloud
A crystal girl I'd spy
She kissed the blue bird's honey tongue
And stuttered as she sighed
I wish to sing the Ching-A-Ling song
Ching-A-Ling song is fine
I'd give my jewels and caviar
To make this daydream mine

(Ching-A-Ling, Ching-A-Ling, Ching-A-Ling) (etc)

While stepping through a heaven's eye
Two lover souls we spied
They wished the cloud boys sang to me
A cheerful happy cry
We love to play our love-strong hearts
No better do we know
No gifts of money do we give
For love is all we own)

Na na na na na na, na na na na na na na na
(Ching-A-Ling, Ching-A-Ling, Ching-A-Ling) (etc)




Columbine

 

Columbine, my prayer design
I see you see me standing on my own
Is it you that I'm walking through?
Should I retrace my point of view?
I'm left in clouded dreams of finding who?
Not Columbine!

Just in case you're my disguise
I found yourself to my surprise
I'm on the ground
And it's Harlequin who picks me up
And catches you
Who banishes me
For finding who you are

(Written and recorded for 'The Looking Glass Murders' production for Scottish TV. Recorded at The Gateway Theatre, Edinburgh, Scotland on 1st February 1970).





Come And Buy My Toys

 

Smiling girls and rosy boys
Come and buy my little toys
Monkeys made of gingerbread
And sugar horses painted red

Rich mens' children running past
Their fathers dressed in hose
Golden hair and mud of many acres on their shoes
Gazing eyes and running wild
Past the stocks and over stiles
Kiss the wind oh merry child
But come and buy my toys

You've watched your father plough the fields with a ram's horn
Sowed it wide with peppercorn and furrowed with a bramble thorn
Reaped it with a sharpened scythe, threshed it with a quill
The miller told your father that he'd work it with the greatest will
Now your watching's over you must play with girls and boys
Leave the parsley on the stalls
Come and buy my toys

You shall own a Cambric shirt
You shall work your father's land
But now you shall play in the market square
Till you'll be a man

Smiling girls and rosy boys
Come and buy my little toys
Monkeys made of gingerbread
And sugar horses painted red




Come See About Me

(Holland/Dozier/Holland)

I've been cryin' (boo-hoo)
'Cause I'm lonely (for you)
Smiles have all turned (to tears)
But tears won't wash away the fear

That you're never ever gonna return (hey, hey, hey, hey, hey)
To ease the fire that within me burns (hey, hey, hey, hey, hey)
It keeps me cryin', baby, for you
Keep me sighin', baby, for you

So won't you hurry
Come on, boy, see about me (come see about me)
See about your baby (come see about me)

I've given up my friends just (for you)
My friends have gone and you have too
No more peace will I find (mmm, mmm)
Until you come back and be mine (mmm, mmm)

No matter what you do or say (hey, hey, hey, hey, hey)
I'm gonna love you anyway (hey, hey, hey, hey, hey)
Keep on cryin', baby, for you
I'm gonna keep me sighin', baby, for you

So come on hurry
Come on and see about me (come see about me)
See about your baby (come see about me)

Sometimes up (up, mmm, mmm)
Sometimes down (down, mmm, mmm)
My life is uncertain (mmm, mmm)
With you not around (mmm, mmm)

From my arms you may be out of reach (hey, hey, hey, hey, hey)
But my heart says you're here to keep (hey, hey, hey, hey, hey)
Keeps me cryin', baby, for you
Keep on, keep on cryin', baby, for you

So won't you hurry
Come on, boy, see about me (come see about me)
See about your baby (come see about me)
You know I'm so lonely (come see about me)
I love you only (come see about me)
See about your baby (come see about me)
Hurry, hurry (come see about me)

(Performed live by David Bowie and The Buzz).

Conversation Piece - (demo)

 

I took this walk to ease my mind
Find out what's gnawing at me
Wouldn't think to look at me
That I spent a lot of time on education
All seems so long ago
I'm a thinker, not a talker
There's no-one to talk to anyway

I can't see the road
For the rain in my eyes
Ahhhhh...h-h

I live above the grocer's store
Owned by an Austrian
Often calls me down to eat
And he jokes about his broken English
Tries to be a friend to me
But for all my years of reading conversation
I stand without a word to say

I can't see the bridge
For the rain in my eyes
Ahhhhh...h-h

And the world is full of life
Full of folk who don't know me
And they walk in two's or three's or more
While the light that shines above the grocer's store
Investigates my face so rudely
And my essays lying scattered on the floor
Fulfill their need just by being there
And my hands shake, my head hurts
My voice sticks inside my throat
I'm invisible and dumb
And no-one will recall me

And I can't see the water
For the tears in my ey-y-yes

(Appears on a demo tape recorded by David Bowie and John 'Hutch' Hutchinson in April 1969).

Cosmic Dancer

(Marc Bolan) (Morrissey's version)

I was dancing when I was twelve
I was dancing when I was twelve
I was dancing when I was... oh
I was dancing when I was... oh
I danced myself out of the womb
I danced myself out of the womb
Is it strange to dance so soon?
Is it strange to dance so soon?

Is it wrong to understand
The fear that dwells inside a man?
What's it like to be a loon?
I liken it to a balloon
Oh... Oh...

I danced myself into the tomb
I danced myself into the tomb
Is it strange to dance so soon?
Is it strange to dance so soon?

Is it wrong to understand
The fear that dwells inside a man?
What's it like to be a loon?
I liken it to a balloon
Oh... Oh... Whoo... Whoo... Whoo...

(Performed live duet with Morrissey at the Inglewood Forum, Los Angeles, USA on 26th May 1991 on the Morrissey World Tour).





Crack City

 

Oh come all you children
Don't grab that scabby hand
It belongs to Mr. Sniff and Tell
It belongs to the candyman

Don't whore your little body
The worms of paradise
Like Everest it's fatal
Its peaks are cold as ice

They're riding on the subway
They're riding on the street
They'll ride you down to the gutter
They'll ride you off your feet

CHORUS
  Gonna hit Crack City
  Hit Crack City

Yeah an' piss on the icon monster
Whose guitars bequeath you pain
They'll face you down to their level
With their addictions and their fast lanes

Corrupt with shaky visions
And crack and coke and alcohol
They're just a bunch of assholes
With buttholes for their brains

You can't keep on riding
The pain you know so well
They'll ride you down to the gutter
Then they'll ride you down to hell

CHORUS

And you the master dealer
May death be on your brow
May razors slash your mainline
I'm calling you out right now

May all your vilest nightmares
Consume your shrunken head
May the ho-ho-hounds of paranoia
Dance upon your stinking bed

Don't look at me you fuckhead
This nation's turning blue
Its stink it fouls the highways
Its filth it sticks like glue

CHORUS

They'll bury you in velvet
And place you underground
The hatred of yourself
And the sufferings that conspire
To take your little body and throw it to the fools
Only your mind can take you out of this
Only your mind or death

I'm riding on the subway
The subway down to hell
I've finished with this journey
Though I seem to know it well

CHORUS (x3)




Cracked Actor

 

I've come on a few years from my Hollywood Highs
The best of the last, the cleanest star they ever had
I'm stiff on my legend, the films that I made
Forget that I'm fifty 'cos you just got paid

CHORUS
  Crack baby crack, show me you're real
  Smack baby smack, is that all that you feel?
  Suck baby suck, give me your head
  Before you start professing that you're knocking me dead

(Oh stay, please stay, please stay)

You caught yourself a trick down on Sunset and Vine
But since he pinned you baby you're a porcupine
You sold me illusions for a sack full of cheques
You've made a bad connection 'cos I just want your sex

CHORUS

(Oh yea, oh stay, all day, oo yeah, oo yeah, don't you dare, oh yeah yeah yeah yeah)
(Ooo)
(Ooo, oh yeah)




Criminal World

(Peter Godwin/Duncan Browne/Sean Lyons)

You never told me of your other faces
You were the widow of a wild cat
And now I know about your special kisses
And I know you know where that's at
I guess I recognise your destination
I think I see beneath your make-up
What you want is sort of separation
This is no ordinary
This is no ordinary
    (Oh, oh, oh)

What a criminal world
The boys are like baby-faced girls
What a criminal girl
She'll show you where to shoot your gun
What a typical mother's son
The only thing that she enjoys
Is a criminal world
Where the girls are like baby-faced boys (boys, boys, boys)

You've got a very heavy reputation
But no-one knows about your low-life
I know a way to find a situation
And hold a candle to your high-life disguise
You caught me kneeling at your sister's door
That was no ordinary stick-up
I'm well aware just what you're looking for
I am no ordinary
I am no ordinary
    (Oh, oh, oh)

What a criminal world
The boys are like baby-faced girls
What a criminal girl
She'll show you where to shoot your gun
What a typical mother's son
The only thing that she enjoys
Is a criminal world
Where the girls are like baby-faced boys (boys, boys, boys)
Baby-faced (boys, boys, boys)
Baby-faced
What a criminal world
What a criminal
A criminal

What a criminal world
What a criminal

Cyclops

 

 


(Believed originally intended for David's proposed 1973 stage version of 'Nineteen Eighty-Four' which was aborted after George Orwell's widow Sonia Blair refused permission).

(Cyclops appears on a reel-to-reel tape dated 5.6.76. Recorded at Gooseberry Sound Studos, 19 Gerrard Street, London W1. Producer was John Shipcott. Also on the tape were three versions of Shadow Man (complete, vocal only and full vocal with half backing track) and The Invader. The tape was auctioned at Sotheby's in 1990).





Cygnet Committee

 

I bless you madly, sadly as I tie my shoes
I love you badly, just in time, at times, I guess
Because of you I need to rest
Because it's you that sets the test

So much has gone and little is new
And as the sparrow sings
Dawn chorus for
Someone else to hear
The Thinker sits alone growing older
And so bitter

    "I gave Them life
    I gave Them all
    They drained my very soul... dry
    I crushed my heart to ease Their pains
    No thought for me remains there
    Nothing can They spare
    What of me?
    Who praised Their efforts to be free?
    Words of strength and care and sympathy
    I opened doors that would have blocked Their way
    I braved Their cause to guide, for little pay
    I ravaged at my finance just for Those
    Those whose claims were steeped in peace, tranquility
    Those who said a new world, new ways ever free
    Those whose promises stretched in hope and grace for me"

I bless you madly, sadly as I tie my shoes
I love you badly, just in time, at times, I guess
Because of you I need to rest, oh yeah
Because it's you that sets the test

So much has gone and little is new
And as the sunrise stream
Flickers on me
My friends talk
Of glory, untold dream, where all is God and God is just a word

    "We had a friend, a talking man
    Who spoke of many powers he had
    Not of the best of men, but Ours
    We used him
    We let him use his powers
    We let him fill Our needs
    Now We are strong

    And the road is coming to its end
    Now the damned have no time to make amends
    No purse of token fortune stands in Our way
    The silent guns of love will blast the sky

    We broke the ruptured structure built of age
    Our weapons were the tongues of crying rage
    Where money stood
    We planted seeds of rebirth
    And stabbed the backs of fathers
    Sons of dirt

    Infiltrated business cesspools
    Hating through Our sleeves
    Yea, and We slit the Catholic throat
    Stoned the poor on slogans such as

    'Wish You Could Hear'
    'Love Is All We Need'
    'Kick Out The Jams'
    'Kick Out Your Mother'
    'Cut Up Your Friend'
    'Screw Up Your Brother or He'll Get You In the End'

    And We Know the Flag of Love is from Above
    And We Can Force You to Be Free
    And We Can Force You to Believe"

And I close my eyes and tighten up my brain
For I once read a book in which the lovers were slain
For they knew not the words of the Free States' refrain
It said:

    "I Believe in the Power of Good
     I Believe in the State of Love
     I Will Fight For the Right to be Right
     I Will Kill for the Good of the Fight for the Right to be Right"

And I open my eyes to look around
And I see a child laid slain on the ground
As a love machine lumbers through desolation rows
Ploughing down man, woman, listening to its command
But not hearing anymore -
Not hearing anymore
Just the shrieks from the old rich

And I Want to Believe
In the madness that calls 'Now'
And I want to Believe
That a light's shining through
Somehow

And I Want to Believe
And You Want to Believe
And We Want to Believe
And We Want to Live
Oh, We Want to Live

We Want to Live
We Want to Live
We Want to Live
We Want to Live
We Want to Live

I Want to Live
I Want to Live
I Want to Live
I Want to Live
I Want to Live
I Want to Live

Live

Dancing In The Street

(Ivy Jo Hunter/William Stevenson/Marvin Gaye)

OK, Tokyo
South America, Australia, France, Germany, UK, Africa (oh oh)

Calling out around the world
Are you ready for a brand new beat?
Summer's here and the time is right
For dancing in the street
Dancing in Chicago
Down in New Orleans
In New York City

All we need is music, sweet music
There'll be music everywhere
They'll be swinging, swaying, records playing
Dancing in the street, oh

It doesn't matter what you wear, just as long as you are there
So come on, every guy, grab a girl, everywhere, around the world
They'll be dancing, dancing in the street

It's an invitation across the nation, a chance for folks to meet
They'll be laughing and singing and music swinging
Dancing in the street

Philadelphia PA
Baltimore in DC now
Don't forget the Motor City
On the streets of Brazil
Back in the USSR
Don't matter where you are

All we need is music, sweet music
There'll be music everywhere
They'll be swinging, swaying, a-records playing
Dancing in the street, oh

It doesn't matter what you wear
Just as long as you are there
So come on, every guy, grab a girl, everywhere, around the world
They'll be dancing, dancing in the street

Way down in LA, every day
Dancing in the street
'Cross in China too
Me and you
Dancing in the street

Don't you know they'll be dancing
Dancing in the street (repeat)




Dancing With The Big Boys

(David Bowie/Carlos Alomar/Iggy Pop)

Something's going on in society
(Dancing with the big boys)
You chew your fingers and stare at the floor
(Dancing with the big boys)
One wrong word and you're out of synch
Talking 'bout a hands on policy
(Big boys)
Death to the trees
(Dancing with the big boys)
They weren't bad, they weren't brave
Nothing is embarrassing
(Dancing with the big boys)
There are too many people, too much belief
(Dancing with the big boys)
Where there's trouble there's poetry
(Dancing with the big boys)
Your family is a football team
(Big boys)
This dot marks your location
(Dancing with the big boys)
Loneliness in a free society
(Dancing with the big boys)
(Big boys)
This could be embarrassing
(Big boys)
(Dancing with the big boys)
(Big boys)
(Big boys)




Day-In Day-Out

 

Day-in day-out
Stay-in fade-out

Day-in oo oo
Day-out oo oo oo

She was born in a handbag
  Love left on a doorstep
What she lacks is a backup
  'Cause nothing seems to make a dent
Go and find her some money, honey
  Try to pay her rent
That's the kind of protection that everyone is shouting about

CHORUS
   Day-in day-out
   Stay-in fade-out

   Day-in oo oo
   Day-out oo oo oo

First thing she learns that she's a citizen
   Some things they turn out right
When you're on the USA
   Someone rings a bell and it's all over
She's going out of her way
   Stealing for that one good rush

Day-in day-out
Stay-in fade-out

She could use a little money
   She's hanging on his arm like a cheap suit
She's got no money, honey
   She's on the other side
Oh come on little baby
   Late night, big town, police, shake down

   Oo oo
   Oo oo
   Day-in day-out
   Stay-in fade-out
   Oo oo
   Oo oo
   Day-in day-out
   Stay-in fade-out

She's got a ticket to nowhere
   She's gonna take a train ride
Nobody knows her, or knows her name
   She's in the pocket of a homeboy
Oo she's gonna take her shotgun - pow!
   Spin the grail spin the drug
She's gonna make the world aware
   She's one angry gal

All of the day-in day-out
Stay-in fade-out

And there's angels everywhere
Some of them even shootin' her down
Shootin' all the video - drugs - bullets and promises
Angels in a ton of sound

   Day-in fade-out
   Oo oo
   Oo oo
   Day-in day-out
   Stay-in fade-out fade-out
All you gotta do is fade out




Dodo

 

Now we can talk in confidence
Did you guess that we've been done wrong?
Lies jump in queue to be first in line
Such a shameless design

Thinks he's well screened from the man at the top
It's a shame that his children disagree
They coolly decide to sell him down the line
Daddy's brainwashing time

He's a dodo, no no, didn't hear it from me
He's a dodo, no no, didn't hear it from me

She's quite enthralled with her childhood of yore
When a unit was a figure, not a she
When lovers chose each other, now the perks are due
Another memo to screw

She's a dodo, no no, didn't hear it from me
But she's a dodo, no no, didn't hear it from me

Can you wipe your nose my child
Without them slotting in your file a photograph?
Can you sleep alone at night?
Wake to find the scorching light of neighbour Jim
He's come to turn you in

Another dodo, no no, didn't hear it from me
Another dodo, no no, didn't hear it from me


Ah, another do do, no, didn't hear it
Do-do, do-do
do




Don't Be Afraid (alias Oh Darling)

 

Don't be afraid to reveal what you know
Don't be afraid to conceal what you show
Oh darling
Don't be afraid
Oh darling
I said, don't be afraid to say what you need
Don't be afraid
What you feel about me
Oh-oh-oh darling

Count me lucky like nobody else
Don't be afraid of me feeling yourself
Oh darling
Lucky forever
Oh darling
I said, don't be afraid to say what you need
Don't be afraid
What you feel about me
Oh-oh-oh darling

Don't be afraid to reveal what you know
Don't be afraid to conceal what you show
Oh darling
Don't be afraid
Oh darling
I said, don't be afraid to say what you need
Don't be afraid
What you feel about me
Oh-oh-oh darling
Oh darling
Oh-oh-oh darling
Oh darling
Oh-oh-oh darling
Oh darling
Oh-oh-oh darling

Don't Bring Me Down

(Johnnie Dee)

I'm on my own, nowhere to roam
I tell you baby, don't want no home
I wander round, feet off the ground
I even go from town to town
I said I think this rock is grand
Say I'll be your man
Don't bring me down, don't bring me down

I met this chick, the other day
And then to me, she said she'll stay
I get this pad, just like a cave
And then we'll have, our living made
And then I'll lead her on the ground
My head is spinning round
Don't bring me down, don't bring me down

I, I, I, I, I need a lover 'cos someone new
And then to her I will be true
I'll buy her furs and pretty things
I'll even buy a wedding ring
But until then I'll settle down
Say I'll be your man
Don't bring me down, don't bring me down
Until then I'll settle down
Say I'll be your man
Don't bring me down, don't bring me down
Don't bring me down




Don't Let Me Down And Down

(Tahra/Valmont)

Still I keep my love for you
No place to hide no way to fall
Nowhere to lie no world so wide
I'm sick and tired of telling you
Don't let me down and down and down
Don't let me down and down and down

I know there's something in the wind
That crazy balance of my mind
What kind of fool are you and I?
Scared to death and tell me why
I'm sick and tired of telling you
Don't let me down and down and down
Don't let me down and down and down

Still I keep my love for you

You made a date with destiny
You jog-jog in my memory
You haunt in mind not fade away
I'm sick and tired of telling you
Don't let me down and down and down
Don't let me down and down and down
I'm sick and tired of telling you

Still I keep my love for you
No place to hide, no way to fall
Nowhere to lie no world so wide
I'm sick and tired of telling you
Don't let me down and down and down
Don't let me down and down and down




Don't Look Down

(Iggy Pop/James Williamson)

Don't look down
They're making sorta crazy sounds
Don't look down, no
Don't know who else came to kneel
On this empty battlefield
But when I hear that crazy sound, I don't look down
From Central Park to Shanty Town
I always hear that crazy sound
From New York to Shanty Town
There's always something else
Don't look down, no

I went this morning to the cemetery
To see old Rudy Valentino buried
Lipstick traces on his name
He never looked down
'Cos they were making crazy sounds
From Central Park to Shanty Town
He always heard that crazy sound
There's always something else
Don't look down, no

When I see you standing there
I can't see the clothes you wear
I just hear that crazy sound
And I can't look down
From Central Park to Shanty Town
I've always heard that crazy sound
From New York to Shanty Town
There's always something else
Don't look down, no
Don't look down
Don't look, don't look down

No I won't be bored I won't be there
Look at life it's no piece of cake
When I hear that crazy sound
I don't look down
From Central Park to Shanty Town
I always hear that crazy sound
From New York to Shanty Town
There's always something else
Don't look down
Don't look down, no
Well, don't look, don't look down




(Don't Sit Down)

 

Yeah, yeah, baby, yeah
Yeah, yeah, baby, yeah
Yeah, yeah, baby, yeah
Yeah
Don't sit down
Don't sit down
Don't sit down




Drink To Me

(David Bowie/Iggy Pop)

(Partial lyrics)

You go out at night from your sixty dollar single down in West Hollywood
With your ripped off clothes that are bulging at the seams
I can't believe that you don't know you look ugly
I mean, are you really all that dumb?
I mean, I don't want you to be that dumb you know
But you are
You're just dumb

Straight out of the cradle and into the hole with you
He begins screaming
When I walk through the door
I'm your new breed of whore
We will now drink to me

(Recorded with Iggy Pop at Oz Studios, Hollywood, USA in May 1975).

Drive-In Saturday

 

Let me put my arms around your head
Gee it's hot, let's go to bed
Don't forget to turn on the light
Don't laugh babe, it'll be alright
Pour me out another phone
I'll ring and see if your friends are home
Perhaps the strange ones in the dome
Can lend us a book we can read up alone

And try to get it on like once before
When the people stared in Jagger's eyes and scored
Like the video films we saw

  His name was always Buddy
  And he'd shrug and ask to stay
  She'd sigh like Twig the Wonder Kid
  And turn her face away

  She's uncertain if she likes him
  But she knows she really loves him
  It's a crash course for the ravers
  It's a Drive-in Saturday

Jung the foreman prayed at work
Neither hands nor limbs would burst
It's hard enough to keep formation, mid this fall out saturation
Cursing at the Astronette
That stands in steel by his cabinet
He's crashing out with Sylvian
Bureau supply for ageing men
With snorting head he gazes to the shore
The once that raged the sea that raged no more
Like the video films we saw

  His name was always Buddy
  And he'd shrug and ask to stay
  And she'd sigh like Twig the Wonder Kid
  And turn her face away

  She's uncertain if she likes him
  But she knows she really loves him
  It's a crash course for the ravers
  It's a Drive-in Saturday yeah
  (repeat chorus)

Drive-in Saturday, it's a Drive-in Saturday
It's a Drive-in Saturday (repeat)
It's a (x3), yes sir (x6), do do etc, yes sir, you love me, you etc

Dum Dum Boys

(Iggy Pop/David Bowie)

(Spoken:)
  What happened to Zeke?
  He's dead out of ??
  How about Dave?
  OD'd on alcohol
  What's Rock doing?
  Oh he's living with his mother
  What about James?
  He's going straight

Things have been tough
Without the dum dum boys
I can't seem to speak
The language
I remember how they
Used to stare at the ground
They looked as if they
Put the whole world
Looked as if they put
the whole world down

The first time I saw he dum dum boys
I was fascinated
They just stood in front
Of the old drug store
I was most impressed
No one else was impressed
Not at all
And we'd sing
Da-da-da-da-da-da
Dum dum day
Where are you now my
Dum dum boys are you
Alive or dead
Have you left me the last
Of the dum dum daze
Then the sun goes down
And the boys broke down

People said we were negative
They said we'd take but
we would never give
But we'd sing da-da-da
Da-da-da dum dum day
Da-da-da-da-da dum
And hope it would pay
Da-da-da-da it's been
A dum dum dum day
A dum dum day

Now I'm looking for
The dum dum boys
Where are you now
When I need your noise

Now I'm looking for
The dum dum boys
The walls close in and
I need some noise




Eight Line Poem

 

Tactful cactus by your window
Surveys the prairie of your room
Mobile spins to its collision
Clara puts her head between her paws
They've opened shops down West side
While the cacti find a home
But the key to the city
Is in the sun that pins the branches to the sky
Ohh-woh-o







Eight Line Poem (Alternative version)

 

Tactful cactus by your window
Surveys the prairie of your room

While the cacti find a home
But the key to the city
Is in the sun that pins the branches to the sky
Woh-woh

Even A Fool Learns To Love

(Lyrics: David Bowie. Music: Claude François/Gilles Thibault/Jacques Revaux)

(David's lyrics for Comme D'Habitude aka My Way)

There was a time, the laughing time
I took my heart to every party
They'd point my way
"How are you today?"
"Will you make us laugh? Chase our blues away?"
Their funny man won't let them down
No, he'd dance and prance and be their clown
That time, that laughing time
When even a fool learns to love

The clown turned around
And saw her smile, oh how she loved me
She'd clap her hands and beg me stay
To make her laugh, to make her life gay
Who wants the love of all the world
When here was love in the eyes of just one girl
That day, that precious day
When even a fool learns to love

But oh, how I dreamed, a marvellous dream
Where all of the heavens or so it had seemed
With thunderous applause looked down from above
On a clown and an angel so much in love
I'll stay with my dream, it takes such a dream
And even a fool learns to love

That day, that hateful day
The joke turned stale, the game was over
Those spiteful words "Oh, go away. Who wants to play?"
"It's getting late now."
My world, my funny world
Had lost its mask and shown a broken heart
A time, a sour time
When even a fool learns to cry

But oh, how I dreamed, a marvellous dream
Where all of the heavens or so it had seemed
With thunderous applause looked down from above
On a clown and an angel so much in love
I'll stay with my dream, it takes such a dream
And even a fool learns to love




Fame

(David Bowie/John Lennon/Carlos Alomar)

Fame, makes a man take things over
Fame, lets him loose, hard to swallow
Fame, puts you there where things are hollow
Fame

Fame, not your brain, it's just the flame
That burns yourself to keep you insane
Fame

Fame, what you like is in the limo
Fame, what you get there's no tomorrow
Fame, what you need you have to borrow
Fame

Fame, "Nien! It's mine!" is just his line
To find yourself in Liverpool, crime
Fame

Ribbly de da bay, ribbly be
Ribbly be, ribbit, ribbly bay
Ribbly de da bay, ribbly bay
Ribbly bay, ribbly bay

Is it any wonder I'll reject you first?
Fame, fame, fame, fame
Is it any wonder you're far too cool to fool
Fame

Fame, bully for you, chilly for me
Gotta get a rain check on pain
Fame

Fame, fame, fame, fame, fame, fame, fame, fame, fame, fame
Fame, fame, fame, fame, fame, fame, fame, fame, fame, fame
Fame, fame, fame

Fame
What's your name?

(whispered)
  Sing Fame




Fame '90 (remix)

(David Bowie/John Lennon/Carlos Alomar)

Fame, makes a man take things over
Fame, lets him loose, hard to swallow

Fame, not your brain, it's just the flame
That burns yourself to keep you insane
Fame

Fame-f-fame

Fame, what you like is in the limo
Fame, what you get is no tomorrow
Fame, what you need you have to borrow
Fame

Fame, "Nien! It's mine!" is just his line
To find yourself in Liverpool, crime
Fame

(What's your name?)

Fame

Ribbly de da bay, ribbly be

Fantastic Voyage

(Lyrics: David Bowie. Music: David Bowie/Brian Eno)

In the event that this fantastic voyage
Should turn to erosion and we never get old
Remember it's true, dignity is valuable
But our lives are valuable too

We're learning to live with somebody's depression
And I don't want to live with somebody's depression
We'll get by, I suppose
It's a very modern world, but nobody's perfect
It's a moving world, but that's no reason
To shoot some of those missiles
Think of us as fatherless scum
It won't be forgotten
'Cos we'll never say anything nice again, will we?

And the wrong words make you listen
In this criminal world
Remember it's true, loyalty is valuable
But our lives are valuable too

We're learning to live with somebody's depression
And I don't want to live with somebody's depression
We'll get by I suppose
But any sudden movement I've got to write it down
They wipe out an entire race and I've got to write it down
But I'm still getting educated but I've got to write it down
And it won't be forgotten
'Cos I'll never say anything nice again, how can I?

(Recorded during the Lodger sessions at Mountain Studios, Montreux, Switzerland in 1979).





Fascination

(David Bowie/Luther Vandross)

Got to use her

Every time I feel fascination
I just can't stand still, I've got to use her
Every time I think of what you pulled me through, dear
Fascination moves sweeping near me
Still I take ya

CHORUS
  (Fascination) fascination
  (sho' nuff) fascination
  (takes a part of me) takes a part of me
  (Can a heartbeat) can a heartbeat
  (live in a fever) live in a fever?
  (raging inside of me?)
  (Fascination) fascination
  (oh, yeah) oh yeah
  (takes a part of me) takes a part of me
  (I can't help it) I can't help it
  (I've got to use her) got to use her
  (every time, ooh)
  Fascination comes around
  (Ooh-oo-ooh)

(Fascination) Your soul is calling
Like when I'm walking
Seems that everywhere I turn
I hope you're waiting for me
I know that people think
That I'm a little crazy
Ohh, better sex is fun
I think I like fascination
Still, tick

CHORUS (twice)
Ad-lib




Fashion

 

There's a brand new dance but I don't know its name
That people from bad homes do again and again
It's big and it's bland full of tension and fear
They do it over there but they don't do it here

Fashion!  Turn to the left
Fashion!  Turn to the right
Oooh, fashion!
We are the goon squad and we're coming to town
Beep-beep
Beep-beep

Listen to me - don't listen to me
Talk to me - don't talk to me
Dance with me - don't dance with me, no
Beep-beep

There's a brand new talk, but it's not very clear
Oh bop
That people from good homes are talking this year
Oh bop, fashion
It's loud and tasteless and I've heard it before
Oh bop
You shout it while you're dancing on the dance floor
Oh bop, fashion

Fashion! Turn to the left
Fashion! Right
Fashion!
We are the goon squad and we're coming to town
Beep-beep
Beep-beep

Listen to me - don't listen to me
Talk to me - don't talk to me
Dance with me - don't dance with me, no
Beep-beep
Beep-beep

REPEAT
  Oh, bop, do do do do do do do do
  Fa-fa-fa-fa fashion
  Oh, bop, do do do do do do do do
  Fa-fa-fa-fa fashion
  La-la la la la la la-la




Fill Your Heart

(Paul Conrad Rose/Paul Williams)

Fill your heart with love today
Don't play the game of time
Things that happened in the past
Only happened in your mind
Only in your mind - ohh forget your mind
And you'll be free - yeah
The writing's on the wall
Free - yeah, and you can know it all
If you choose - just remember
Lovers never lose
'Cos they are free of thoughts unpure
And of thoughts unkind
Gentleness clears the soul
Love cleans the mind
And makes it free - free

Oh happiness is happening
The dragons have been bled
Gentleness is everywhere
Fear's just in your head
Only in your head
Fear is in your head
Only in your head
So forget your head
And you'll be free
The writing's on the wall
Free - yeah, and you can know it all
If you choose, just remember
Lovers never lose
'Cos they are free of thoughts unpure
And of thoughts unkind
Gentleness clears the soul
Love will clean your mind
And make you free!!!

Free - yea' - yeah-yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah-yeah (repeat) Free - yea'




Five Years

 

Pushing thru' the market square, so many mothers sighing
News had just come over, we had five years left to cry in
News guy wept and told us, Earth was really dying
Cried so much his face was wet, then I knew he was not lying
I heard telephones, opera house, favourite melodies
I saw boys, toys, electric irons and TV's
My brain hurt like a warehouse, it had no room to spare
I had to cram so many things to store everything in there
And all the fat-skinny people, and all the tall-short people
And all the nobody people, and all the somebody people
I never thought I'd need so many people

A girl my age went off her head, hit some tiny children
If the black hadn't a-pulled her off, I think she would have killed them
A soldier with a broken arm, fixed his stare to the wheels of a Cadillac
A cop knelt and kissed the feet of a priest, and a queer threw up at the sight of that
I think I saw you in an ice-cream parlour, drinking milk shakes cold and long
Smiling and waving and looking so fine, don't think you knew you were in this song
And it was cold and it rained so I felt like an actor
And I thought of Ma and I wanted to get back there
Your face, your ace, the way that you talk
I kiss you, you're beautiful, I want you to walk

We've got five years, stuck on my eyes
Five years, what a surprise
We've got five years, my brain hurts a lot
Five years, that's all we've got
We've got five years, what a surprise
Five years, stuck on my eyes
We've got five years, my brain hurts a lot
Five years that's all we've got
We've got five years, stuck on my eyes
Five years, what a surprise
We've got five years, my brain hurts a lot
Five years, that's all we've got
We've got five years, what a surprise
We've got five years, stuck on my eyes
We've got five years, my brain hurts a lot
Five years that's all we've got
Five years, five years, five years, five years

Everybody young and old
Learns how to rock 'n' roll
Listen to something new
Everybody sure can do

CHORUS
  Foot stomping, foot stomping, foot stomping, foot stomping

CHORUS

Wish I could shimmy like my sister Kate
Well she can shimmy like a jelly on a plate
All the girls are I can do it

East going West, I go the West

Meet me at the dance hall
We're gonna have a ball
Sure cure all you want
Forlorn
Reborn

CHORUS

Foot stomping
All of the time
Foot stomping
All of the time

Friday On My Mind

(George Reburn Young/Harry Vanda)

Monday morning feels so bad
Everybody seems to nag me
Coming Tuesday I feel better
Even my old man looks good
Wednesday just don't go
Thursday goes too slow
I've got Friday on my mind

CHORUS
  (See my baby) Gonna have fun in the city (feel like fucking you)
  (Do my baby screw) Be with my girl she's so pretty (all I want to do)
  (I'm not crazy) She looks fine tonight
  (Zoom zoom zoom x3) She is outta sight to me (so divine)
  (Tonight)  I spend my bread
  (Tonight)  I'll lose my head
  (Tonight)  I've got to get tonight
  Monday I'll have Friday on my mind

Do the five day drag once more (Monday blue)
Know of nothing else that bugs me
More than working for the rich men (poor man, beggar man, thief)
Hey I'll change that scene one day
Today I might be mad
Tomorrow I'll be glad
'Cos I'll have Friday on my mind

CHORUS

(See my baby) (feel like fucking you)
Gonna have fun
(zoom zoom zoom)
Be with my girl (repeat ad lib.)

Fun

Back into the funhouse

Really good time
Really good time

In the funhouse (repeat)

Future Legend

 

And in the death
As the last few corpses lay rotting on the slimy thoroughfare
The shutters lifted an inch in Temperance Building
High on Poacher's Hill
And red mutant eyes gazed down on Hunger City
No more big wheels

Fleas the size of rats sucked on rats the size of cats
And ten thousand peoploids split into small tribes
Coveting the highest of the sterile skyscrapers
Like packs of dogs assaulting the glass fronts of Love Me Avenue
Ripping and rewrapping mink and shiny silver fox, now legwarmers
Family badge of sapphire and cracked emerald
Any day now

The Year of the Diamond Dogs

(Recorded during the Diamond Dogs sessions at the Olympic Studios, Barnes, London SW13 in 1974).

Get Real

(Lyrics: David Bowie. Music: David Bowie/Brian Eno)

Oh hideous year
We angels of lead
We're dead, we're sick
Hanging by thread
Get real
Get real

You can't stop meaningful teenage cries
From deep behind fifty year old eyes
Get real
Get real

CHORUS
  I'm scared to touch
  Too tense to be undone
  I walk the streets
  Not expecting morning sun

Against the voice of doom
Failures fall all over town

I guess I should, I feel I should
Get real
Get real

What's up?
What happened when I wasn't around?
Who did what?
What went down?

Get real
Get real

Think about myself it happens to me
It happens in the tunnel when I let myself feel

Get real
Get real

CHORUS

I feel it all through breakdowns falling all over town
I feel I should, I guess I should

Get real
Get real
Get real
Get real

The dazzle of light
The rape of life
The seed, the curse
The jazz of life

Get real
Get real

Get real
Get real

Girls

(Lyrics: David Bowie. Music: David Bowie/Erdal Kizilcay)

Girls
They come and they go
They kiss
Come and they go
Like breeze
Brushing my cheek
Like pain
Like the tears on my face

Girls
They come and they go
Like spirits
They vanish at dawn
My heart
Suspended in time
Like you
Vanish like tears in the rain

Girls
They take their loves away
Like spirits
Living so far away

Girls
Pretending to break down and cry
Girls
Whispering wind
What are they giving away

We used to be so happy
Remember, remember
So happy
I never knew
How lonely
How lonely
How lonely I could feel

Girls
They come and they go
They kiss
They come and they go
Like spirits
Brushing my cheek
Like pain
Like the tears on my face

Girls
They take their loves away
Like spirits
Living so far away

Girls
Pretending to break down and cry
Girls
Whispering wind
What are they giving away

We used to be so happy
Remember, remember
So happy
I never knew
How lonely
How lonely
How lonely I could feel

Glad I've Got Nobody

 

Well, I'm glad I've got nobody
Yes, I'm glad I've got nobody
Oh, I'm glad I've got nobody
To be loved by me

All the world couldn't take your place
Another girl, another face
Wouldn't be the type of thing
Know I've found it out and see
Another girl standing next to me
Oh no, just you
Oh no, just you

Well, I couldn't find another you
Everywhere I go, I see your name
I couldn't find another you
Everywhere I go, it's just the same

And I'm glad I've got nobody
Oh, I'm glad I've got nobody
Yes, I'm glad I've got nobody

Well, I'm glad I've got nobody
Oh, I'm glad I've got nobody
And I'm glad I've got nobody
To be loved by me

All the world couldn't take your place
Another girl, another face
Wouldn't be the type of thing
Know I've found it out and see
Another girl standing next to me
Oh no, just you
Oh no, just you

Well, I couldn't find another you
Everywhere I go, I see your name
Well, I couldn't find another you
Everywhere I go, it's just the same

And I'm glad I've got nobody
Yes, I'm glad I've got nobody
Really glad I've got nobody, oh

Glass Spider

 

Up until one century ago there lived
In the Zi Duang provence of eastern country
A glass-like spider
Having devoured its prey it would drape the skeletons over its web
In weeks creating a macabre shrine of remains
Its web was also unique in that it had many layers
Like floors of a building

At the top of this palace-like place, assembled with almost apparent care
Were tiny, shining objects, glass, beads, dew-drops
One could almost call it an altar
When the breeze blew through this construction
It produced sounds of wailing, crying
Tiny wails, tiny cries

The baby spiders would get scared and search frantically for their mother
But the Glass Spider would have long gone
Having known that the babies would survive somehow on their own
Oh the Glass Spider had blue eyes almost like a human's
They shed tears at the wintered turn of the centuries

Don't you hear this wasted cry? Life is over you
(Mummy come back 'cos the water's all gone)
But you've seen who's in Heaven. Is there anyone in hell?
(Gone gone the waters all gone, Mummy come back 'cos it's dark now)

Ah ah ah ah
Ah ah ah ah ahh

Take care, take care
Mummy come back 'cos the water's all gone
Somewhere she glows divine. Somewhere she wakes alone
But do you promise in your lovin' eye. God it's dark now
(Mummy come back 'cos it's dark now)
Jah Jah Jah Jah Jah
Jah Jah Jah Jah Jah

Jah Jah Jah Jah Jah

Gone, gone the water's all gone
Mummy come back 'cos the water's all gone
Stay low on the ground, the fire can drive you, savage and afraid
Speeding at the dawn, come along before the animals awake
Gone, gone, the water's all gone
Mummy come back 'cos it's dark now

Run, run, moving all night, rivers to the left
If your mother don't love you then the riverbed might
Gone, gone, the water's all gone
Mummy come back 'cos the water's all gone

Go Now

(Larry 'Bessie' Banks/Milton Bennett)

We've already said
  (1: goodbye 2: so long)

Since you gotta go, oh you had better
Go now    go now, go now
(Go now)    Before you'll see me cry
I don't want you to tell me just what you intend to do now
'Cos how many times do I have to tell you darlin', darlin'
I'm still in love (3: still in love) with you now
Whoa-oh-oh-oh

I don't wanna see you go, oh you had better
Go now    go now, go now
(Go now)    Don't you even try
Tellin' me that you really don't want it to end this way
'Cos darlin', darlin', can't you see I want you to stay
Yeah, yeah

(repeat verse 1)

I don't wanna see you go but darlin', you better go now

(Performed live with Tin Machine during the 1991-92 'It's My Life' World Tour, lead vocals by Tony Sales).





God Knows I'm Good

 

I was walking through the counters of a national concern
And a cash machine was spitting by my shoulder
And I saw the multitude of faces, honest, rich and clean
As the merchandise exchanged and money roared
And a woman hot with worry slyly slipped a tin of stewing steak
Into the paper bag at her side
And her face was white with fear in case her actions were observed
So she closed her eyes to keep her conscience blind

Crying
  "God knows I'm good
    God knows I'm good
    God knows I'm good
    God may look the other way today

    God knows I'm good
    God knows I'm good
    God knows I'm good
    God may look the other way today"

Then she moved toward the exit clutching tightly at her paper bag
Perspiration trickled down her forehead
And her heart it leapt inside her as the hand laid on her shoulder
She was led away bewildered and amazed
Through her deafened ears the cash machines were shrieking on the counter
As her escort asked her softly for her name
And a crowd of honest people rushed to help a tired old lady
Who had fainted to the whirling wooden floor

Crying
  "God knows I'm good
    God knows I'm good
    God knows I'm good
    Surely God won't look the other way

    God knows I'm good
    God knows I'm good
    God knows I'm good
    Surely God won't look the other way"




God Only Knows

(Brian Wilson/Tony Asher)

If you should ever leave me
My life would still go on believe me
The world could show nothing to me
So what good would living do me
God only knows what I'd be without you

I may not always love you
But as long as there are stars above you
You'll never need to doubt it
I'll make you so sure about it
God only knows what I'd be without you




Golden Years

 

Golden years, gold whop whop whop
Golden years, gold whop whop whop
Golden years, gold whop whop whop

Don't let me hear you say life's taking you nowhere, angel
Come get up my baby
Look at that sky, life's begun
Nights are warm and the days are young
Come get up my baby

There's my baby, lost that's all
Once I'm begging you save her little soul
Golden years, gold whop whop whop
Come get up my baby

Last night they loved you, opening doors and pulling some strings, angel
Come get up my baby
In walked luck and you looked in time
Never look back, walk tall, act fine
Come get up my baby

I'll stick with you baby for a thousand years
Nothing's gonna touch you in these golden years, gold
Golden years, gold whop whop whop
Come get up my baby

Some of these days, and it won't be long
Gonna drive back down where you once belonged
In the back of a dream car twenty foot long
Don't cry my sweet, don't break my heart
Doing all right, but we gotta get smart
Wish upon, wish upon, day upon day, I believe oh Lord
I believe all the way
Come get up my baby

There's my baby, lost that's all
Once I'm begging you save her little soul
Golden years, gold whop whop whop
Come get up my baby

Don't let me hear you say life's taking you nowhere, angel
Come get up my baby
Run for the shadows, run for the shadows
Run for the shadows in these golden years

I'll stick with you baby for a thousand years
Nothing's gonna touch you in these golden years, gold
Golden years, gold whop whop whop (11 times)




Golden Years

Good Morning Girl

 

Hey, hey, good morning girl
Hey, hey, good morning girl
Hey, hey, good morning girl
But I can't pass this time of day

'Cos I'm on my way to rest my head
And I've lost the mind that I used to have
And I don't have a dime to spare

Hey, hey, good morning girl
Hey, hey, good morning girl
Hey, hey, good morning girl
But I can't pass this time of day

So go tell the man that collects the dues
That you saw a guy without any shoes
Who would do the job if he was built that way

Hey, hey, good morning girl
Hey, hey, good morning girl
Hey, hey, good morning girl
But I can't pass this time of day, no
I can't pass this time of day

'Cos I'm on my way to rest my head
And I've lost the mind that I used to have
I don't have a dime to spare

Hey, hey, good morning girl
Hey, hey, good morning girl
Hey, hey, good morning girl
But I can't pass this time of day

So go tell the man that collects the dues
That you saw a guy without any shoes
Who would do the job if he was built that way

Hey, hey, good morning girl
Hey, hey, good morning girl
Hey, hey, good morning girl
But I can't pass this time of day, no
I can't pass this time of day




Goodbye Mr. Ed

(David Bowie/Hunt Sales)

The ghost of Manhattoes
Shrieking as they fall
From AT&T
Someone sees it all
Goodbye Mr. Ed
Andy's skull enshrined
In a shopping mall near Queens
Someone sees it all

Icarus takes his pratfall
Bruegel on his head
Goodbye Mr. Ed

Four and twenty black kids
Some of them are blind
Someone sees it all
Tolerance of violence
By the fellows with no heads
Goodbye Mr. Ed

CHORUS (twice)
  Some things are so big
  They make no sense
  Histories so small
  People are so dense
  Someone sees it all
  Goodbye Mr. Ed

Never mind the Pistols
They laid the Golem eggs
Others came to hatch them
Outside the pale
Someone sees it all
Goodbye Mr. Ed




Got My Mojo Working

(McKinley Morganfield)

 

(Performed live by Davie Jones and The King Bees).





Growin' Up

(Bruce Springsteen)

Here we go, a 1, 2, 3, 4

Well I stood stoned-like at midnight
Suspended in my masquerade
I combed my hair till it was just right
And commanded the night brigade
I was open to pain and crossed by the rain
And I walked on a crooked crutch
I strolled all alone through a fallout zone
Came out with my soul untouched

I hid in the clouded wrath of the crowd
But when they said "Sit down" I stood up
Ooh-ooh growin' up

The flag of piracy flew from my mast
My sails were set wing to wing
I had a jukebox graduate for first mate
She couldn't sail but she sure could sing
I pushed the B-52 and bombed 'em with the blues
With my gear set stubborn on standing
I broke all the rules, strafed my old high school
Never once gave thought to landing, no

An' I hid in the clouded warmth of the crowd
But when they said "Come down" I threw up
Ooh-ooh growin' up

I took month-long vacations in the stratosphere
And you know it's really hard to hold your breath
And I swear I lost everything I ever loved or feared
I was the cosmic kid in full costume dress
Well my feet finally took root in the Earth
But I got a nice little place in the stars
And I swear I found the key to the universe
In the engine of an old parked car

I hid in the mother breast of the crowd
But when they said "Move down" I moved up
Ooh-ooh, don' cha know that I'm growin' up
I said Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, I can't help it that I'm growin' up 



Gunman

(Adrian Belew/David Bowie)

Gunman
My sort of star
They put you there
You're all of us now
You're all over town
On wrappers and cans
You're bigger than life
You're braver than dad
You're a gunman
Holding your own
You're a gunman
Never alone

Gunman
Leader of packs
Shadow of death
Killer in chic
Never betrayed
Friend of our kids
You're a gunman
Holding your own
You're a gunman
Never alone

Gunman
Gunman
Trader in arms
Kids on the streets
Buying your charms

Gunman
My sort of star
We put you there
You're all of us now
You're all over town
On wrappers and cans
You're bigger than life
You're braver than dad
You're a gunman
Holding your own
You're a gunman
You're never alone

Gunman
Gunman

Gunman
My sort of star
We're bleeding for you
We put you there
What would you give
You're all of us now
We're burning for you
You're all over our town, gunman
You're on wrappers and cans
You're bigger than life
And we're dying for you
And you're braver than dad, gunman
Your women are dogs
But they're braver than you

We're bleeding for you
What would you give
We're burning for you
Gunman

We're bleeding for you
We invented you
What would you give
Now we gotta live with you
We're burning for you
You're more solid than a rock
Gunman
A rock of cocaine or crack
Gunman
Or ice or death
Like a rock of death
Like a gravestone
Gunman




Hallo Spaceboy

(Lyrics: David Bowie. Music David Bowie/Brian Eno)

  Keep going baby
  Keep going baby
  Keep going baby
  Baby

Spaceboy, you're sleepy now
Your silhouette is so stationary
You're released but your custody calls
And I wanna be free

Don't you wanna be free?
Do you like girls or boys?
It's confusing these days
But Moondust will cover you
Cover you

This chaos is killing me

CHORUS
  So bye bye love
  Yeah bye bye love
  Bye bye love
  Yeah bye bye love

This chaos is killing me - (Moondust)

Hallo Spaceboy, you're sleepy now

And the chaos is killing me

Hammerhead

(David Bowie/Hunt Sales)

I should never call her
Heartbreakers, never kill
But she's been New Zealand on another trip
Have you felt like Dixon
And Ray, and Ali?

Hit me
Hit me baby
On the camera
Take me in
I'm going down
Hit me baby
You win
You're the very tough with a long past

You're a hammerhead
Sweet thing

Keep it all stuck on here
She's all black or white
Don't tell her where I'm livin'

Hit me
Hit me baby
She got me ruined
She's a bore
She fell apart
Oh, oh, ooh
She's so fabulous
Just like Cher
It was life at the top
You would be I

I mention her hammerhead
Oh, oh, ooh

Hit me baby

She's a hammerhead
Sweet thing

Enter the dragon

Just like Cher
It was life at the top
It would be I

She's a hammerhead
Sweet thing
She's a hammerhead
Mention her hammerhead
Oh, oh, ooh




Hang On To Yourself

Pray to the light machine
She wants my honey not my money she's a funky-thigh collector
Layin' on 'lectric dreams

CHORUS

  Well come on, well come on, if you think we're gonna make it

But then we move like Tigers on Vaseline
Well the bitter comes out better on a stolen guitar
You're the blessed, we're the Spiders from Mars

  Well come on, well come on, we've really got a good thing going
  Well come on, well come on, if you think we're gonna make it

Harlem Shuffle

(Relf/Nelson)

You move it to the left and you go for yourself
You move it to the right if it takes all night
Now take it kinda slow with a whole lotta soul
Don't move it too fast. Just make it last

You scratch just like a monkey
Yeah ya do - real cool
You slide it to the limbo
How low can you go?
Now come on, baby
Don't fall down on me now

Just move it right here to the Harlem Shuffle
Do the Harlem Shuffle

Hitch, hitch-hike, baby, across the floor
I can't stand it no more
Now come on baby - now get into your slide
Just ride, ride, ride, lil' pony ride

Do the Harlem Shuffle... do the Monkey Shine
Shake a tail feather, baby

(Performed live by David Bowie and The Buzz).





He Was Alright - (early version of Lady Stardust)

 

 





Heathen (The Rays)

 

Steel on the skyline
Sky made of glass
Made for a real world
All things must pass
Oo-o

Waiting for something
Looking for someone
Is there no reason?
Have I stared too long?
Oo-o, Oo-o

You say you'll leave me

And when the sun is low
And the rays high
I can see it now
I can feel it die
Oo-o, Oo-o




Heaven's In Here

 

Baby I dream between the blade and the tongue
Of the rose on your cheek, the wounded and dumb
We stumble and fall, we stumble and fall
Skin on skin but there's heaven...

CHORUS
  Heaven's in here
  Heaven's in here
  Among the twilight and stars
  Like a rocket to Mars
  Heaven's in here

The first and the last are telling it all
Telling you loud but selling it small
I'm taking a swing at this shadow of mine
Crucifix hangs an' my heart's in my mouth
But it's here

CHORUS

Hitting it one time
Uh-uh-uh-uh-uh
Heaven in here

Heaven lies between your marbled thighs
The rustle of your falling gown
We stumble and fall like tragedy falls
We stumble and twirl there's heaven in here
We stumble and fall uncertain we fall
It's flesh on flesh but there's heaven...
Heaven's in here

CHORUS

You'll dance to my tongue, we'll dance on the sun
We're the twilight and stars
And there's heaven in here

Heaven




"Helden"

(Lyrics: David Bowie. Music: David Bowie/Brian Eno. Translation: Antonia Maas)

Du
Koenntest du schwimmen
Wie Delphine
Delphine es tun
Niemand gibt uns eine chance
Doch wir koennen siegen
Fuer immer und immer
Und wir sind dann Helden
Fuer einen tag

Ich
Ich bin dann Koenig
Und Du
Du Koenigin
Auch wenn sie
Unschlagbar scheinen
Werden wir Helden
Fuer einen tag
Wir sind dann wir
An diesem tag

Ich
Ich glaub' das zu traeumen
die Mauer
Im Ruecken war kalt
Schuesse peitschen die Luft
Doch wir kuessen
Als ob nichts geschieht
Und die scham fiel auf ihre seite
Oh, wir koennen sie schlagen
Fuer alle Zeiten
Dann sind wir Helden
Nur diesen tag
Dann sind wir Helden
Dann sind wir Helden
Dann sind wir Helden

(Recorded during the "Heroes" sessions at Hansa Tonstudio, Berlin, Germany in 1977. German version).

Henry And The H-Bomb

(Ian Hunter)

Down in the basement
Stands his brother on a Fender bass guitar went
You're looking for a suitable replacement
To play for Henry and the H-Bombs

Don't you know he comes about the flowers
He can talk for hours and for hours
About the rain and the showers
But his whole trip is the power

There'll be (?) in the meanwhile
Anything (?) can change in a (?)
That's no way to treat them all
Halfway making it, halfway faking it
Henry and the H-Bombs
Der Der Der Der Der Der
Where we got the name from
All I see (?) too long
After seeing sweet Henry and the H-Bombs

You know he comes on like the flowers
He can talk for hours and for hours
About the rain and the showers
How it'll change in an hour

Get along in the meanwhile
Have another change in a wee while
That's no way to treat them all
Halfway making it, halfway taking it
Henry and the H-Bombs
Der Der Der Der Der Der
Where we got the name from
(?)
Making it with Henry and the H-Bombs

Here comes the night

With another guy
His arms around her like it used to be with me
Oh it makes me want to die

CHORUS
  Yeah, here it comes
  Here comes the night

And simply let them be?

CHORUS
  Here it comes
  Here comes the night
  Here comes the night
  Yeah... (here comes the night)

Oh she's with him he's turning down the lights
But now he's holding her the way I used to do

Exactly like she told me too

  Oh, here, here comes the night
  Yeah... (here comes the night)

Here, here comes the night (repeat ad inf.)

Here Today, Gone Tomorrow

(Bonner/Harris/Jones/Middlebrooks/Robinson/Satchell/Webster)

You're like a sailor with a girl on every shore
Stay with her now for they won't see you no more
Like a Gypsy forever on the run
Stay for a while you look for a whore

Like that sailor leaves, come back again
Stay for a while and they won't see you again
Like that Gypsy caravan, forever on the run
You stay for a while, then you pick up and go

CHORUS
  That's how you show your love for me
  That's how you show your love for me, you're like
  Here today, gone tomorrow
  Each time you come, you leave a little sorrow, you're like
  Here today, gone tomorrow
  Each time you come, you leave a little sorrow

You're like that big big star that's torn the town apart
Leaving everyone to console their aching heart
Like that snow that fell, looks so wrong and out of place
Stay for a while and then you leave without a trace

That's 'xactly like that star that tore the town apart
Leaving everyone to console their aching heart
Like that snow that fell, looks so wrong and out of place
Stay for a while leave without a trace

That's how you show your love for me
That's how you show your love for me
Here today, gone tomorrow
Each time you come, you leave a little sorrow, you're like
Here today, gone tomorrow
Each time you stay, you leave a little sorrow

Here today, gone tomorrow, hmmm
You're like
Here today, gone tomorrow
Each time you come, you leave a little sorrow
Here today, gone tomorrow
Each time you come, you leave a little sorrow

Here today baby
Here today, but gone tomorrow




"Heroes"

(Lyrics: David Bowie. Music: David Bowie/Brian Eno)

I, I will be king
And you, you will be queen
Though nothing will drive them away
We can beat them, just for one day
We can be Heroes, just for one day

And you, you can be mean
And I, I'll drink all the time
'Cos we're lovers, and that is a fact
Yes we're lovers, and that is that

Though nothing, will keep us together
We could steal time, just for one day
We can be Heroes, for ever and ever
What d'you say?

I, I wish you could swim
Like the dolphins, like dolphins can swim
Though nothing, nothing will keep us together
We can beat them, for ever and ever
Oh we can be Heroes, just for one day

I, I will be king
And you, you will be queen
Though nothing will drive them away
We can be Heroes, just for one day
We can be us, just for one day

I, I can remember (I remember)
Standing, by the wall (by the wall)
And the guns, shot above our heads (over our heads)
And we kissed, as though nothing could fall (nothing could fall)
And the shame, was on the other side
Oh we can beat them, for ever and ever
Then we could be Heroes, just for one day

We can be Heroes
We can be Heroes
We can be Heroes
Just for one day
We can be Heroes

We're nothing, and nothing will help us
Maybe we're lying, then you better not stay
But we could be safer, just for one day

Oh-oh-oh-ohh, oh-oh-oh-ohh, just for one day

(Recorded during the "Heroes" sessions at Hansa Tonstudio, Berlin, Germany in 1977).





"Héros"

(Lyrics: David Bowie. Music: David Bowie/Brian Eno. Translation: ???)

Moi, je souhaiterai que tu nages
Comme les dauphins
Les dauphins savent nager
Bien que rien
Nous gardera ensemble
Nous les vaincrons
Les vaincrons a jamais
On peut être un héros
Pour juste une journée

Moi
Je serai un roi
Et toi
Tu seras ma reine
Bien que rien
Rien ne les chassera
On pourra être un héro
Pour juste une journée
On pourrait être nous
Pour juste une journée

Je
Je me rapelle
(je me rapelle bien)
Debout près du mur
(près du mur)
Les gardes tireront au delà de nous
(au delà de nous)
Et je t'embrassais
Comme si rien ne tombait
(rien ne tombait)
Et la honte
Etait de l'autre côté
Oh nous les vaincrons
Nous les vaincrons à jamais
On pourra être un héros
Pour juste une journée

On peut être un héro
On peut être un héro
On peut être un héro
Pour juste une journée
On peut être un héro

Niemand gibt uns eine Chance
Doch wir koennen siegen
Fuer immer und immer
Und wir sind dann Helden
Fuer einen tag

Ich
Ich bin dann Koenig
Und Du
Du Koenigin
Auch wenn sie
Unschlagbar scheinen
Werden wir Helden
Fuer einen Tag
Wir sind dann wir
An diesem Tag

Ich
Ich glaub' das zu traeumen
die Mauer
Im Ruecken war kalt
Schuesse peitschen die Luft
Doch wir kuessen
Als ob nichts geschieht
Und die Scham fiel auf ihre Seite
Oh, wir koennen sie schlagen
Fuer alle Zeiten
Dann sind wir Helden
Nur diesen Tag
Dann sind wir Helden
Dann sind wir Helden
Dann sind wir Helden
Nur diesen Tag

Dann sind wir Helden

We're nothing
And nothing will help us
Maybe we're lying
Then you better not stay
But we could be safer
Just for one day

(Recorded during the "Heroes" sessions at Hansa Tonstudio, Berlin, Germany in 1977).





Hey Ma Get Papa

(David Bowie/Mick Ronson)

There I stood like soap on heat
While blood ran thick past both my quaking feet
Into the street

J.J. Dean and Pigsty Paul, just coughed and grinned
And sank into the pack, don't turn me back

J.J. had blessed us
Cramped me up with salt, Tequila, lemon peel  (C'mon, c'mon)
My heart began to reel  (C'mon, Let's do it again)

Hey Ma Get Papa
Soon you'll have no son to bitch
You're gonna cry  (C'mon, c'mon, c'mon)
I've left a man to die.  (I've left some man to die)

(Speaks when he screams), with his old black jeans
And a spike from the ground, and all I saw was red
When he touched my head

So I picked up a spike, that once was a fence
And I stuck it in his side, and all we saw was red, oh Ma!
He must be dead

Good God, we cracked out
Never threw up until we had run, ten blocks or more  (C'mon, c'mon)
Then we really poured   (C'mon, Let's do it again)

Hey Ma Get Papa
Soon you'll have no son to bitch
You're gonna cry  (C'mon, c'mon, c'mon)
I've left some man to die  (I've left some man to die)




Hideaway

(Iggy Pop/David Bowie)

I need to touch
A live unbeaten earth
So that's where I'm going

I know a town
In North-West Mexico
Where the sun is gold
And life exists
Hideaway, hideaway, truly
Hideaway, hideaway, truly

My country got
Raped by big industry
We'll just have to wing it

The concrete strips
Raw creed and king TV
They say, 'So what'
I say 'So this'
Hideaway, hideaway, truly
Hideaway, hideaway, truly

I can hear children's voices
Ringing in a yard
When I hear children's voices
My feelings aren't so hard

Your honest face
Your quiet simple grace
You are one thing
I will not waste
Hideaway, hideaway, truly
Hideaway, hideaway, truly




Hold On! I'm Comin'

(Isaac Hayes aka Ed Lee/David Porter)

(Chorus)

Don't you ever feel sad
Lean on me when times are bad
When the day comes and you're down
In a river of trouble and about to drown

  Just hold on, I'm comin'
  Hold on, I'm comin'

I'm goin' my way, your lover
If you get cold I'll be your cover
Don't have to worry 'cos I'm here
No need to suffer baby, I'm here

  'Cos hold on, I'm comin'
  Hold on, I'm comin'
  Hold on, I'm comin'
  Hold on, I'm comin'

  Reach out to me for satisfaction
  Call my name now for quick reaction
Don't you ever feel sad?
Lean on me when times are bad
When the day comes and you're down
In a river of trouble and about to drown

  Just hold on, I'm comin'
  Hold on, I'm comin'

  Just hold on, I'm comin'
  Hold on, I'm comin'

  Just hold on, I'm comin'
  Hold on, I'm comin'

(Performed live by David Bowie and The Buzz).





Hole In The Ground (demo)

 

(No lyrics)
You can stay at home alone
Don't even answer the phone
I will come when it's right
And I won't stay all night

For I see something bad
Just a-looking above me
Just a-looking above me

I see a hole in the ground
I see a hole in the ground
But there's no-one around
But the sheets on the street
But I'm quick on my feet
And I'm running to you
Just a-looking above me
Just a-looking above me

There's a hole in the ground
There's a hole in the ground
But there's no-one around
But the sheets on the street
And I'm quick on my feet
And I'm running to you
Just a-looking above me
Just a-looking above me
Just a-looking above me
Just a-looking above me


(Demo acetate recording from either late 1969, 1970 or early 1971 with George Underwood (vocals), David Bowie (guitar), Herbie Flowers (bass), Tim Renwick (guitar) and Terry Cox (drums). The b-side was a non-vocal version of the same song, but was to be entitled 'Lump On The Hill'. Hole In The Ground was re-recorded for the March 2001 unreleased album Toy).





Hole In The Ground (2000 version)

 

You can stay at home alone
You can stay at home alone
Don't even answer the phone
I will come when it's right
And I won't stay all night

For I see something bad
Just a-looking above me
Just a-looking above me

I see a hole in the ground
I see a hole in the ground
But there's no-one around
But the sheets on the street
But I'm quick on my feet
And I'm running to you
Just a-looking above me
Just a-looking above me

There's a hole in the ground
There's a hole in the ground
But there's no-one around
But the sheets on the street
And I'm quick on my feet
And I'm running to you
Just a-looking above me
Just a-looking above me
Just a-looking above me
Just a-looking above me


(Re-recorded for the March 2001 unreleased album Toy).





Holy Holy (1971 version)

 

Listen lady, let me lie low, lie low with you
To be a lie-high-high-high
My high-high lie-low lie
Slowly, it gets good and holy
Helping one another, just a righteous brother
Nightime, give me back the nightime
I don't wanna be angel, just a little bit evil
I feel a devil in me

Holy, holy
Hold on to anyone, hold on to anyone
But just let me be
Holy, holy
Hold on to anyone, hold on to anyone
But let go of me

Listen lady, let me lie low, lie low with you
To be a lie-high-high-high
High-high oh my

Holy, holy
Hold on to anyone, hold on to anyone
But just let me be
Holy, holy
Hold on to anyone, hold on to anyone
But let go of me

Ahh, ahh, ahh, ahhh

Listen lady, let me lie low, lie low with you
To be a lie-high-high-high
High-high oh my

La la la la la la, to be a la la a la l la my oh my

(Original 1971 Mercury single release).





Holy Holy

 

Listen baby, let me lie low, lie low with you
To be lie-high-high-high
High-high lie-low lie
Slowly, it's good and holy
Helping one another, just a righteous brother
Lifetime, give me back my lifetime
I don't want to be an angel, just a little bit evil
Feel the devil in me

Holy, holy
Hold on to anyone, hold on to anyone
But just let me be
Holy, holy
Hold on to anyone, hold on to anyone
But let go of me

Listen baby, let me lie low, lie low with you
To be a lie-high-high-high

Hoochie Coochie Man

(Willie Dixon)

Gypsy woman told my momma, before I was born
You got a boy-child comin', gonna be a son-of-a-gun
Gonna make these pretty women, jump and shout
And the world will only know, a-what it's all about

Y'know I'm here
Everybody knows I'm here
And I'm the hoochie-coochie man
Everybody knows I'm here

On the seventh hour, of the seventh day
On the seventh month, the seventh doctor said:
"He's born for good luck, and I know you see
Got seven hundred dollars, and don't you mess with me"

Y'know I'm here
Everybody knows I'm here
And I'm the hoochie coochie man
Everybody knows I'm here

Gypsy woman told my momma
Said "Ooh, what a boy he gonna
make so many women jump and shout for joy"

Y'know I'm here
Everybody knows I'm here
And I'm the hoochie-coochie man
Everybody knows I'm here

Gypsy woman told my momma, before I was born
"You got a boy-child comin', gonna be a son-of-a-gun
Gonna make these pretty women, jump and shout
And the world will only know, a-what it's all about"

Y'know I'm here
Everybody knows I'm here
And I'm the hoochie-coochie man
Everybody knows I'm here

I got a black cat bone, I got a mojo too
I got John the Conqueror, I'm gonna mess with you
I'm gonna make you, pretty girl, lead me by the hand
Then the world will know, the hoochie coochie man

(Performed live by Davie Jones and The King Bees).





Hop Frog

(Lou Reed)

Well they call me a juicy hop-frog
You can see me in any wood bog
Don't you know that they call me the hop-frog
Hopping frog

I'm a hop-frog
A hop-frog
They call me the hop-frog
Hop, hop-frog

They call me the hop-frog
See me in any wood bog
Don't you know that call me a hop-frog
Hop-frog

They call me the hop-frog
See me in a wood bog
They're calling me a hop-frog
Hop-frog

You can see me in a ballroom
You can see me in a bedroom
You can see me in the woods
Hop, hop-frog

They call me the hop-frog
They call you the hop-frog
Well they call you the hop-frog
Hop, hop-frog

Frog

(Sung by David Bowie, appears on Lou Reed's album The Raven).





How Lucky You Are

 

VERSE
  When you speak you speak to me
  When you sleep you sleep by me
  When you wake you wake with me
  When you walk you follow two steps behind

Realise terror stalking, ever grasping sinking for me
It wasn't love it was the fix of never wanting me
Now I'm gone, you're tossing and turning in your sleep
That's the name of the game, of the game, of the game

Cry, Miss Peculiar
You'll cry all the more, now I'm gone
I was the monkey on your back
Take a look at how lucky you are

VERSE

Cry, cry, Miss Peculiar
You'll cry all the more, now I'm gone
I was the monkey on your back
Take a look at how lucky you are

Some days are heaven, I will not deny
Probing the daylight cascading the skyline
Tripping and diving and losing it all
Back came the night time, I was waiting for more things

Cry, cry, Miss Peculiar
You'll cry all the more, now that I'm gone
I was the devil monkey on your back
Take a look at how lucky you are

VERSE




Hung Up

(??)

 

(Performed live by David Bowie and The Buzz).





Hung Up On This Girl

 

 







Hurt

(Trent Reznor)

I hurt myself today
To see if I still feel
I focus on the pain
The only thing that's real
The needle tears a hole
The old familiar sting
Try to kill it all away
But I remember everything

What have I become?
My sweetest friend
Everyone I know
Goes away in the end

And you could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt

I wear this crown of shit
Upon my liar's chair
Full of broken thoughts
I cannot repair
Beneath these stains of time
The feelings disappear
You are somewhere else
But I am still right here
What have I become?
My sweetest friend
Everyone I know
Goes away in the end

And you could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt

If I could start again
A million miles away
I would keep myself
I would find a way

(Performed live with Nine Inch Nails during the Outside World Tour 1995 in the USA).





I Ain't Got You

(Calvin Carter)

I got a Maserati GT
With snakeskin upholstery
I got a charge account at Goldblatt's
But I ain't got you

I got a closet full of clothes
But no matter where it goes
It keeps a ring in the nose
But I ain't got you

I got a tavern and a liquor store
I play the numbers, yeah, four forty-four
I got a mojo, yeah, don't you know
I'm all dressed up with no place to go

I got women to the right of me
I got women to the left of me
I got women all around me
But I ain't got you
No, I ain't got you

(Third verse)

(Fourth verse)

No I ain't got you

(Cover version of The Yardbirds track performed live by Davy Jones and The Manish Boys).





I Am A Laser

 

I saw him by the DJ
The way he danced was cool
They said that I stood no chance
They called me little fool
Well here I am before ya
And all your friends can see
He'll roast him like a turkey
It's just this flame in me
And no-one can burn like me

I am a laser
Burning through your eyes
And I know what kind of man you are
And I long to hold you tight
I am a laser
Knowing right from wrong
And I know what kind of heart you have
A heart so big and strong

I dreamt how much I lay on ya
Sitting by your side
Driving in my Duesenberg
Going for a ride
I'm going to turn my beam on
If only for an hour
You'll know I've switched the heat on
When you feel my golden shower
And no-one can burn like me

I am a laser
Burning through your eyes
And I know what kind of man you are
And I long to hold you tight
I am a laser
Knowing right from wrong
And I know what kind of heart you have
A heart so big and strong

I know what the boys call me
They think I'm black Barbarella
But only one beam do I have
And that's this heart beat of mine

I am a laser
Burning through your eyes
And I know what kind of man you are
And I long to hold you tight
I am a laser
Knowing right from wrong
And I know what kind of heart you have
A heart so big and strong

(Recorded during the Ava Cherry and The Astronettes sessions at the Olympic Studios, Barnes, London SW13 in November 1974. Evolved into Scream Like A Baby. Original version eventually appears on Ava Cherry and The Astronettes 'People From Bad Homes' in 1995. The track was also recorded during the Young Americans sessions on 13th August 1974 at the Sigma Sound Studios in Philadelphia, USA under the title Lazer but a completely different version).





I Am Divine

 

So you think I'm dressed to impress you
Say I walk a little too tall
I think I may caress you
And show you how I fall
Got my vines(?) at the right time
One step ahead of y'all

I walk a fine line
Pay my price and you'll be mine
'Cos I'm so divine

I'm the mainman in my city
Hey Jim, I'm in control
?????
?????
Don't you want to feel it
Don't you want it all

I walk a fine line
Pay my price and you'll be mine
'Cos I'm so divine

I walk a fine line
Pay my price and you'll be mine
'Cos I'm so divine

(Released on Ava Cherry and The Astronettes 'People From Bad Homes' in 1995).





I Am With Name

(Lyrics: David Bowie. Music: Bowie/Eno/Gabrels/Garson/Kizilcay/Campbell)

(Segue)

I was Ramona A. Stone
I started with no enemies of my own
I was an artiste
In a tunnel
But I've been having a midi-life crisis
And I've been dreaming of sleep
And ape men with metal parts
I've spat upon deeply felt age
I've hid my hearts in
And I hate the funny coloured English
We'll creep together you and I
For I know who the small friends are


(Song)

I am with name, I am with name
I am Ramona A. Stone
A night fear female
Good timing drone
I am with name, I am with name

I am with name, I am with name
I am Ramona A. Stone
And she should say: "twitch and stream"
It'll end in chrome
The night of the female good time drone
I am with name
I am Ramona A. Stone
And she should say
I am with name
I am Ramona A. Stone

A person who loses her name
Feels anxiety descending
Left at the crossroads, between the centuries
A millennium fetish
I am with name, I am with name
I am Ramona A. Stone
I am with name

Night fear female
Good timing drone
I am with name
I am Ramona A. Stone

  (Give it to me one more time!)
Anxiety descending
Anxiety descending




I Can't Explain

(Pete Townsend)

A new feeling inside
It's a certain kind
I feel hot and cold
Down my soul, baby

I can't explain
Going out of my mind
Dizzy in the head, and I'm feeling blue
Things you say well maybe they're true
I get funny dreams again and again
Know what it means, but

Can't explain
I think it's love
Say it to you
When I feel blue

I can't explain, no, I can't explain

You know I can't explain
I'm going out of my mind
Well I'm a worried guy
But I can't explain




I Can't Read

(David Bowie/Reeves Gabrels)

I can't read and I can't write down
I don't know a book from countdown
I don't care which shadow gets me
All I've got is someone's face

Money goes to money heaven
Bodies go to body hell
I just cough and catch the chase
Switch the channel watch the police car

CHORUS
  I can't read shit anymore
  I just sit back and ignore
  'Cos I just can't get it right, can't get it right
  I can't read shit, I can't read shit

When you see a famous smile
No matter where you run your mile
To be right in that photograph
Andy where's my fifteen minutes?

I said - yeah
  I can't read shit anymore
  I just can't read shit anymore
  No matter I, just can't get it right
  I can't read shit, I can't read shit

No!
No!
Oh - oh - oh




I Dig Everything

 

I've got the village tied up
  (Dig everything)
I walk along beside the garbage man 'cos I dig everything
  (Dig everything)
I wave to the policemen, but they don't wave back
They don't dig anything
  (Dig everything)
Ain't had a job for a year or more and I don't own a thing
  (Dig everything)

Everything's fine and I dig everything
Everything's fine and I dig everything
Dig!

I feed the lions in Trafalgar Square and I dig everything
  (Dig everything)
I've sit just behind my window, till my cigarettes were low and dug
Everything
  (Dig everything)
Got a backstreet room in the bad part of town and I dig everything
  (Dig everything)
I'd see people in the street below, who don't know where they're going
They don't dig anything
  (Dig everything)

Everything's fine and I dig everything
Everything's fine and I dig everything
Dig!

I've got more friends than I've had hot dinners
Some of them were losers, but the rest of them are winners
Rick, John, Sally, a connection named Paul
Holy low on money, their intentions are tall
We smoke and talk in my room and we dig everything
Dig!

I've made myself at home
  (Dig everything)
I've made good friends with the time-check girl on the end of the phone
All the movie shows
  (Dig everything)
I sunbathe for love
  (Dig everything)
Even when it's not too hot
  (Dig everything)
'Cos I dig everything
  (Dig everything)
Oh yeah

I Feel Free

(Jack Bruce/Peter Brown)

Dear when I dance with you
We move like the sea
You, you're all I want to know
I feel free
I feel free

I can walk down the street
There's no one there
The pavement is one huge crowd
I can drive down the road
My eyes can't see
But my mind wants to cry out loud

I can walk down the street
There's no one there
The pavement is one huge crowd
I can drive down the road
My eyes can't see
But my mind wants to cry out loud
My mind wants to cry out loud

I feel free

Dance floor is like the sea
The ceiling is the sky
You're the sun, and as you shine on me
I feel free
I feel free
I feel free




I Feel So Bad

(Chuck Willis)

Feel so bad
Like a ball game on a rainy day
Feel so bad
Like a ball game on a rainy day
Yes' I got my rain check
Shake my head and walk away

Oooo-people that's the way I feel
Oooo-people that's the way I feel
Sometimes I think I want
Then again I think I don't
Sometimes I want to stay here
Then again I want to leave here
Then again I want to stay
Yes, I got my train fare
Pack my grip and ride away

Oooo-people that's the way I feel
Oooo-people that's the way I feel
Sometimes I think I want
Then again I think I don't

(Performed live at the Gorge Ampitheatre, WA, USA on 16th August 2002).





I Got You Babe

(Sonny Bono)

They say we're young and we don't know
We won't find out until we grow
Well I don't know if all that's true
'Cos you got me, and baby I got you

Babe
I got you babe
I got you babe

They say our love won't pay the rent
Before it's earned, our money's always spent
I guess that's so, we don't have a pot
But at least I'm sure of all the things we got

Babe
I got you babe
I got you babe

I got flowers in the spring
I got you to wear my ring
And when I'm sad, you're a clown
And if I get scared, you're always around

Don't let them say your hair's too long
'Cos I don't care, with you I can't go wrong
So put your little hand in mine
There ain't no hill or mountain we can't climb

Babe
I got you babe
I got you babe

I got you to hold my hand
I got you to understand
I got you to walk with me
I got you to talk with me
I got you to kiss goodnight
I got you to hold me tight
I got you, I won't let go
I got you to love me so

I got you babe
I got you babe
I got you babe
I got you babe
I got you babe




I Have Not Been To Oxford Town

(Lyrics: David Bowie. Music David Bowie/Brian Eno)

Baby Grace is the victim
She was fourteen years of age
And the wheels are turning, turning
For the finger points at me (All's well)
But I have not been to Oxford Town (All's well)
No I have not been to Oxford Town

Toll the bell
Pay the private eye
All's well
The twentieth century dies

And the prison priests are decent
My attorney seems sincere
I fear my days are numbered
Lord get me out of here, here
All's well
But I have not been to Oxford Town
All's well
But I have not been to Oxford Town

Toll the bell
Pay the private eye
All's well
The twentieth century dies

This is your shadow on my wall
This is my flesh and blood
This is what I could've been

And the wheels are turning and turning
As this twentieth century dies
If I had not ripped the fabric
If time had not stood still
If I had not met Ramona
If I'd only paid my bill
All's well
I have not been to Oxford Town
All's well
But I have not been to Oxford Town

Toll the bell
Pay the private eye
All's well
The twentieth century dies

This is my bunk with two sheets
This is my food though foul
This is what I could have been

Toll the bell
Pay the private eye
All's well
The twentieth century dies

Toll the bell
Pay the private eye
All's well
The twentieth century dies
All's well
The twentieth century dies
All's well

All's well, all's well
Toll the bell
Pay the private eye
All's well
The twentieth century dies
Toll the bell
Pay the private eye
All's well
The twentieth century dies

(Original working title was Toll The Bell).





I Keep Forgettin'

(Jerry Leiber/Mike Stoller)

I keep forgettin' you don't love me no more
I keep forgettin' you don't want me no more
I keep forgettin' that you told me that you
Didn't want me around any more
But these stupid old feet
Just head for your street
Like they've done so many times before
And this stubborn old fist
On the end of my wrist
Keeps a knocking on your front door

I keep forgettin' you don't love me no more
I keep forgettin' you don't want me no more
I keep forgettin' bout those heartbreaking nights
And those heartbreaking things
That you said
Though I know in my heart
We're drifting apart
I can't believe that our love is dead
Though it's plain as can be
That you're finished with me
I just can't get it through my head




I Know It's Gonna Happen Someday

(Steven Patrick Morrissey / Mark Nevin)

My love wherever you are
Whatever you are, don't lose faith
I know it's gonna happen someday
To you
Please wait
Please wait
Wait, don't lose faith
You say that the day never arrives
And it's never seemed so far away
But I know it's gonna happen someday
To you
Please wait
Please wait
Wait, don't lose faith
Please wait
Please wait
Please, don't lose faith
Don't lose faith

You say that the day never arrives
And it seems so far away
But I know it's gonna happen someday
Someday to you
To you
Please wait




I Lost My Confidence

 

 





I Never Dreamed

(David Jones / Alan Dodds)

I never dreamed
That I'd fall in love with you
I never dreamed
That your eyes could be so blue

Till I looked your way baby
And saw your tender smile
I wanted you so badly
My heart was captured for a while

I never dreamed
Your caress could hurt so much
I never dreamed
That I would shake to your tender touch

Till you held my hand
Run your fingers through my hair
The other guys all laughed at me
But I didn't really care

I never dreamed

How do you make it through the night?
I hope to God you're still here

It's a dog's tomorrow
And the song on the wind
Brings nothing back sorrow

I Took A Trip On A Gemini Spaceship

(Norman Carl Odam)

Took a trip on a Gemini spacecraft
And I thought about you
I passed through the shadow of Jupiter
(sigh)
And I thought about you
I shot my spacegun
Boy, really felt blue

Two or three flying saucers
Parked under the stars
Winding scream
Moon shining down
On some little town
And with each beam
The same old dream

I took a trip on a Gemini spacecraft
And I thought about you
Well I shot my spacegun
And I thought about you
Pulled down my sun visor
Boy, I really felt blue

You jumped into your Gemini
Jumped into mine
We'll orbit the Moon
For just one time
Tomorrow night
Tomorrow night
Will you hold hands
With me under the moonlight?

Took a trip in a Gemini spacecraft
And I thought about you
I shot my spacegun
And I thought about you
I took, I took a walk in space
Boy, I, I really felt blue

Well I peeked through the crack
And I looked way back
Stardust trail
Leading back to you
What did I do?
What could I do?
Yes what did I do?
Well
I thought about you
I thought about you
Took a trip on a Gemini spacecraft
Thought about you




I Wanna Be Your Dog

(Iggy Pop)

So messed up, I want you near
In my room I want you here
Now we're gonna be face to face
And I'll lay right down in my favourite place

(Chorus)
  Now I wanna be your dog
  Now I wanna be your dog
  Now I wanna be your dog
  Well, c'mon!

Now I'm ready to close my eyes
Now I'm ready to close my mind
Now I'm ready to feel the hand
To lose my heart in the burnin' sand




I Want My Baby Back

 

I'm working day and night to find me my passage to write
I'm gonna get the next train, going to be right by her side
Ooh-ah Kitty, just you see
Don't put the blame on me, oh no

I want my baby back, oh no
I want my baby back

I tried to phone her, but the cable was broke by a storm
Now I won't see her till tomorrow, when night meets the dawn
Ooh-ah Kitty, just you see
Don't put the blame on me, oh no

I want my baby back, oh no
I want my baby back

I'll buy her anything
A big fat car, a diamond ring
If she will be my girl
I want her back, I need you girl

I'm working day and night to find me my passage to write
I'm gonna get the next train, going to be right by her side
Ooh-ah Kitty, just you see
Don't put the blame on me, oh no

I want my baby back, oh no
I want my baby back, oh no

I Wish You Would

(Billy Arnold)

CHORUS
  Early in the morning by the break of day
  That's when my baby went away
  Come back baby I wish you would
  This crying and grieving won't do me no good

Hugging and a-kissing, late at night
You know pretty baby it feels just right
Come back baby what you're trying to do?
Turning on me and some other man too

Come back baby gimme me one more chance
You know I still love you gonna give you romance
Yeah, romance, all night long
In my arms, oh yeah, oh

CHORUS

Hey pretty baby I love you so
You know pretty baby it hurts me to see you go
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh, yeah (repeat ad inf.)




I Would Be Your Slave

 

Walking in the snowy street
Let me understand
Drifting down a silent path
Stumbling over land
Open up your heart to me
Show me who you are
And I would be your slave

Do you sleep in quietude?
Do you walk in peace?
Do you laugh out loud at me?
But no one else is free
Open up your heart to me
Show me all you are
And I would be your slave

I don't sit and wait
I don't give a damn
I don't see the point at all
No footprints in the sand

I bet you laugh out loud at me
A chance to strike me down
Give me peace of mind at last
Show me all you are
Open up your heart to me
I would be your slave

I don't sit around and wait
I don't give a damn
I don't see the point at all
No footprints in the sand

I would give you all my love
Nothing else is free
Open up your heart to me
And I would be your slave

(Performed live at the Tibet Annual Benefit Show on 22nd February 2002).

I'm A Hog For You

(Jerry Leiber/Mike Stoller)

I can't get enough of your love

When I go to sleep at night
You're the only thing I'm dreaming of

I'm Deranged

(Lyrics: David Bowie. Music David Bowie/Brian Eno)

Funny how secrets travel
I'd start to believe if I were to bleed
Thin sky, the man chains his hands held high
The cruise me blond
Cruise me babe
A blond beneath beyond beyond beyond
No return, no return

I'm deranged
Deranged my love
I'm deranged down down down
So cruise me babe cruise me baby

CHORUS
  And the rain sets in
  It's the angel-man
  I'm deranged

Cruise me, cruise me, cruise me babe

The clutch of life and the fist of love
Over your head
Big deal Salaam
Be real deranged Salaam
Before we reel
I'm deranged

CHORUS (twice)

Cruise me, cruise me, cruise me babe

I'm deranged




I'm Getting Back To Me

(??)

 

(Performed live by David Bowie and The Buzz).





I'm Not Losing Sleep

 

Yes, I've read the morning papers
Telling me that you've made money
Do you think I'm gonna crawl, then think again

Though I'm dressed in rags, I'm richer
Though I eat from tins, I'm healthier
Though I live in slums, I'm purer than you, my friend

Too bad, I'm not losing sleep
(Too bad) I'm just counting sheep
(Too bad) I'm not losing sleep, my friend

Look around and see the friends
The ones you left, our friends deserted
See the guys that used to talk and drink with you

Don't look down your nose at me
'Cos I won't ask your sympathy
I won't be your yes-sir man for anything

Too bad, I'm not losing sleep
(Too bad) I'm just counting sheep
(Too bad) I'm not losing sleep, my friend

I would walk with you
Talk with you, drink with you
If you drop that halo that you're wearing on the ground

Too bad, I'm not losing sleep
(Too bad) I'm just counting sheep
(Too bad) I'm not losing sleep, my friend

I can't get my satisfaction
Knowing you won't get reaction
What makes me the big attraction anyway

It's too bad, I'm not losing sleep
(Too bad) I'm just counting sheep
(Too bad) I'm not losing sleep, my friend

Too bad, I'm not losing sleep
(Too bad) I'm just counting sheep
(Too bad) I'm not losing sleep, my friend

Oh, it's too bad, I'm not losing sleep
(Too bad) I'm just counting sheep
(Too bad) I'm not losing sleep, my friend




I'm Not Quite - (demo)

 

The hand that wrote this letter
Sweeps the pillow clean
So rest your head and read a treasured dream
I care for no one else but you
I tear my soul to cease the pain
I think maybe you feel the same
What can we do?
I'm not quite sure what we're supposed to do
So I've been writing just for you

They say your life is going very well
I hear you sparkle like a different girl
But something tells me that you hide
When all the world is warm and tired
You cry a little in the dark
Well so do I
I'm not quite sure what you're supposed to say
But I can see it's not okay

He makes you laugh
He gives ya every chance
He treats you well
And brings you out in style
And when he's strong
He's strong for you
And when you kiss
It's something new
But did you ever call my name
Just by mistake?
I'm not quite sure what I'm supposed to do
So I'll just write some love to you

(Appears on a demo tape recorded by David Bowie and John 'Hutch' Hutchinson in April 1969. The song was later renamed Letter To Hermione).





I'm Pure

 

 




I've Been Waiting For You

(Neil Young)

I've been looking for a woman to save my life
Not to beg or to borrow
A woman with the feeling of losing once or twice
Who knows how it could be, be tomorrow?

I've been waiting for you
And you've been coming to me
For such a long time now
For such a long time now

A woman with the feeling losing once or twice
Who knows how it could be, be tomorrow?

I've been waiting for you
And you've been coming to me
For such a long time now
For such a long time now
For such a long time now
For such a long time now

If I'm Dreaming My Life

(David Bowie/Reeves Gabrels)

VERSE (there)
  Was she never there/here?
  Was she ever?
  Was it air she breathed?

  At the wrong time
  Oh-oh
  Oh-oh

All the flowers so
From the gallery
With the hymns of night
Singing "Come to me"

CHORUS
  At the wrong time
  On the wrong day
  All the lights are fading now
  If I'm dreaming all my life (x2 second time)

Just one living chance
When the mother sighs
When the father steps aside
At the wrong time
Oh-oh

VERSE (here)

CHORUS

Was she ever?
Was she ever here?
If I'm dreaming all my life
If I'm dreaming all my life away

Dreaming my life
Dreaming my
Dreaming my
Dreaming my
Dreaming my life
Dreaming my life away
Oh-oh

REPEAT
  Dreaming my life
  Dreaming my
  Dreaming my life away
  Oh-oh




If There Is Something

(Brian Ferry)

If there is something
That I might find
Look around corners
Try to find peace of mind, I say
"Where would you go
If you were me?
Trying to keep a straight course is not easy"

Somebody special
Looking at me
Same kind of reaction
Wanted to cry with me
If there are many
Too easy to say
When it's love
It's just a game-ame-ame-ame

I would do anything for you
I would come all day
I would swim all the oceans blue
I would walk a thousand miles
Reveal my secrets
More than enough for me to share
I will put roses around your door
Sit in the garden
Growing potatoes by the score

Shake your head girl, with your ponytail
Takes me right back (when you were young)
Throw your precious gifts into the air
Watch them fall down (when you were young)

Your love - could feel you put them on the ground
It used to fall apart (when you were young)

Your love - could feel you put them on the ground
The hills were higher (when you were young)

Your love - could feel you put them on the ground
The trees were taller then (when you were young)

Your love - could feel you put them on the ground
The grass was greener (when you were young)

Your love - could feel you put them on the ground
It use to fall apart (when you were young)




If You Don't Come Back

Imagine

(John Lennon)

Imagine there's no heaven
It's easy if you try
No hell below us
Above us only sky
Imagine all the people
Living for today

Imagine there's no country
It isn't hard to do
Nothing to kill or die for
And no religion too
Imagine all the people
Living life in peace

You may call me a dreamer
But I'm not the only one
I hope someday you'll join us
And the world will be one

Imagine no possessions
I wonder if we can?
No need for greed or hunger
A brotherhood of man
Imagine all the people
Sharing all the world

You may call me a dreamer
But I'm not the only one
I hope someday you'll join us
And we'll live our lives as one

You may call me a dreamer
But I'm not the only one
I hope some day you'll join us
And the whole world will be one

And the world will live as one
And the world will live as one
And the world will live as one
And the world will live as one
And the world will live as one
And the world will live as one
And the world will live as one
And the world will live as one
And the world will live as one

(Performed live during the final concert of The Serious Moonlight Tour at the Hong Kong Coliseum on 8th December 1983).





In The Heat Of The Morning

 

The blazing sunset in your eyes will tantalise
Every man who looks your way
I watched them sink before your gaze
Senorita sway
Dance with me before their frozen eyes
I'm so much in love
Like a little soldier catching butterflies

CHORUS
  No man loved like I love you
  Wouldn't you like to love me too?
  In the heat of the morning
  In the shadow I'll clip your wings
  And I'll tell you I love you
  In the heat of the morning

I'll tie a knot in rainbow's end, organise the breeze
Light my candle from the sun
I'll give you daylight for a friend
I'll do all of these
I'll prove that it can be done, oh, I'm so much in love
Like the ragged boy who races with the wind

CHORUS

In the heat of the morning
In the shadow I'll clip your wings
And I'll tell you I love you
In the heat of the morning

Oh yeah, all day, all the way

Ooh




In The Heat Of The Morning (2000 version)

Isolation

(Iggy Pop/David Bowie)

Needed you
You were only using
Needing you just
Tore me down
Here I stand
In isolation
Feeling emptiness and doubt
Walking down the
Broken highway
Sucking sugar
Plain and sweet
Did your mother
Ever tell you
That the joyful are free

I need some lovin'
Like an inmate needs a dime
I need some lovin'
Like a poet needs a rhyme
Here I stand in isolation
My empty hands - in isolation
Walking down the
Broken highway
Sucking sugar
'Cos it's my way

Find me one heart
To complete with
Heading for the
Farthest beaches
I need some lovin'
Like a body needs a soul
I need some lovin'
Like a fastball needs control
Here I stand in isolation
My empty hands - in isolation
Strike up the band
In this proud land

Got a lot to do
Got a lot to say
Got a life to live
Here I stand -
In isolation

It's Gonna Be Me

 

Hey Jack I better shake it off. Put her out of my head
Thinking I balled just another young girl last night
Oh brother! I left a woman in that morning bed
Been on that trip so many times
Good God! Was it really yesterday?

I've tried so many, many, many, many, many, many ways
I've lied and taken off into the day
Leaving another girl to weep over the breakfast tray
Loved her before I knew her name, hit me Jack, 'cos I'm
Gonna love her way

CHORUS
  (Come back, my babe)
  Come back, my babe
  Be holy again, I gave her
  (I gave her) Ooh, maybe, maybe
  (Ooh maybe) Gotta give her, ooh baby, baby (Ooh baby)
  That kind of love
  Can only destroy, I gave her
  (I gave her) Ooh maybe, maybe
  (Ooh maybe) Get it down if I'm gonna be her baby, 'cos
  (Ooh baby)
  Gonna be me
  (It's gonna be me)

There was no rein to check me
When all of those little things walked on by
Oh! But I couldn't really stammer out a word
When that angel stuck in my mind
Oooooh, looking for love won't hold me back
(No!) I'm gonna love her way

CHORUS

Just playing that latest record
Waiting for the telephone to ring
Wiped out and bitter with a bag clutched in her hand
All the cars sound like they're pulling in the drive
Hmmm, no, no, no

I see her now
A little tear running down her cheek
Lost, let down
People looking for me
I want to race down her street
And knock hard, hard, hard on the door until
Until she breaks down into my arms like a
Treasured toy and I feel her pain
I'll be so strong, again and again

Come back my baby
I'm hold you again, I'll take you
(I'll take you) Ooh, baby, baby, baby
(Ooh baby) We're gonna have, ooh baby, baby (Ooh baby)
My kind of love
Can only bring you joy, I'm gonna
(I'm gonna) Yeah, baby
(Ooh baby) Yeah, I'll give you baby, baby (Ooh baby)
'Cos it's gonna be me (It's gonna be me)
Hmmmm




It's Gonna Rain Again

It's Hard To Be A Saint In The City

(Bruce Springsteen)

I had skin like leather and the diamond-hard look of a Cobra
I was born blue and weathered but I burst just like a super-nova
I could walk like Brando right into the sun, and dance just like a Casanova
With my black-jack and jacket and my hair slicked sweet
Silver studs on my duds just like a Harley in heat
When I strut down the street I can hear its heartbeat
The sisters fell back and said "Don't that man look pretty"
The cripple on the corner cried out "Penny, nickels for your pity"
Them gasoline boys down-town, they sure talk gritty
It's so hard to be a saint in the city

I was the king of the alley, mama, I could talk some trash
I was the Prince of the Paupers, crowned down-town at the Beggars' Bash
I was a pimp's main prophet, I kept everything cool
Just a back-street gambler with the luck to lose
And when the heat came down it was left on the ground, mama
Devil appeared to me like Jesus through the steam in the street, and
Showed me a hand that even the cops couldn't beat
An' I felt his hot breath on my neck as I dove into the heat
It's so hard to be a saint when you're just a poor boy out on the street

And the sages of the subway sit just like the living dead
As the tracks clack out the rhythm, the eyes fixed straight ahead
They ride the line of balancing, hold on by just a thread
Well, it's too hot in these tunnels, you can get hit up by the heat
When you get up to get out at your next stop
But they push you right down in your seat
And your heart starts beating faster as you struggle to your feet
Then you're out of that hole, back on the street
And them South-side sisters, they sure look pretty
And the cripple on the corner cries out "Nickels for your pity"
And them down-town boys, they sure talk gritty
It's so hard to be a saint in the... city

Shirnetto ya kage ga ka ku mei o miteiru
Mo tengoku no giu no kai dan wa nai

Silhouettes and shadows watch the revolution
No more free steps to heaven
It's no game

Ore genjitsu kara shime dasare
Nani ga okkote iru ka wakara nai

Doko ni kyokun wa aruka
Hitobito wa yubi ooraneteiru
Konna dokusaisha ni igashime rareru nowa kanashi

I am barred from the event
I really don't understand the situation
And it's no game

Documentaries on refugees
Couples 'gainst the target
You throw a rock against the road
And it breaks into pieces
Draw the blinds on yesterday, and it's all so much scarier
Put a bullet in my brain, and it makes all the papers

Nammino kiroku eiga
Hioteki o se ni shita koibi to tach
Michi ni ishi o nage reba
Konago na ni kudake
Kimo ni nutao sureba
Kyo hu wa masu
Ore no atama ni tama o buchi kome ba
Shinbun wa kaki tateru

So where's the moral when people have their fingers broken
To be insulted by these fascists it's so degrading
And it's no game

Shut up!   Shut up




It's No Game (Part 2)

 

Silhouettes and shadows watch the revolution
No more free steps to heaven
Just walkie-talkie - heaven or hearth
Just big heads and drums - full speed and pagan
And it's no game

I am barred from the event
I really don't understand the situation
So where's the moral?
People have their fingers broken
To be insulted by these fascists is so degrading
And it's no game

Documentaries on refugees, couples 'gainst the target
Throw a rock against the road, and it breaks into pieces
Draw the blinds on yesterday, and it's all so much scarier
Put a bullet in my brain, and it makes all the papers

And it's no game

Children round the world, put camel shit on the walls
They're making carpets on treadmills, or garbage sorting

And it's no game




It's No Game - (earlier version)

 

Silhouettes and shadows watch the revolution
No more free steps to heaven
Just walkie-talkie - heaven or hearth
Just big heads and drums - full speed and pagan
Well it's no game

I am barred from the events
I really don't understand the situation
So where's the moral?
People have their fingers broken
To be insulted by these fascists is so degrading
It's no game

Documentaries on refugees, couples against the target
Throw a rock upon the road, and it breaks into pieces
Draw the blinds on yesterday, and it's all so much scarier
Put a bullet in my brain, and it makes all the papers

It's no game

Children round the world, put camel shit on the walls
They're making carpets on treadmills, or garbage sorting

And it's no game

It's So Easy

(Buddy Holly/Norman Petty)

Well, you're concerned that my heart as learned
It's so easy to fall in love
It's so easy to fall in love
So here I go breaking all of the rules
It seems so easy, (seems so easy, seems so easy)
Umm-hmm so doggone easy (doggone easy , doggone easy)
Umm-hmm, it seems so easy, (seems so easy, seems so easy, seems so easy)
Well, your concerned that my heart has learned

It's so easy to fall in love
It's so easy to fall in love
It's so easy to fall in love
It's so easy to fall in love

Look into your heart and see
What your love could be set apart for me
It seems so easy, (seems so easy, seems so easy)
Umm-hmm so doggone easy (doggone easy , doggone easy)
Umm-hmm, it seems so easy, (seems so easy, seems so easy, seems so easy)
Well, your concerned that my heart has learned

It's so easy to fall in love
It's so easy to fall in love

Janine - (demo)

 

My love, Janine
I'm helpless for your smile
Like a Polish wanderer
I travel ever onwards to your land
Were it not just for the jewels, I'd close your hand

Your plain demand
To collocate my mind
Scares me into gloom
You're too intense
I'll keep my veil across my face
I've no defence
I've got to keep you in your place

Janine, Janine, you'd like to know me well
But I've got things inside my head
That even I can't face

Janine, Janine, you'd like to crash my walls
But if you take an axe to me
You'll kill another man
Not me at all

You're fey, Janine
A tripper to the last
But if I catch you standing on my toes
I'll have a right to shout you down
You're just a lazy stream
In which my thoughts would drown

So stay, Janine
And we can glide along
I've caught your wings for laughs
I'm not obliged to read your statements of the year
So take your glasses off
And don't act so sincere

Janine, Janine, you'd like to know me well
But I've got things inside my head
That even I can't face

Janine, Janine, you'd like to crash my walls
But if you take an axe to me
You'll kill another man
Not me at all

Nah nah nah nah nah nah, nah nah nah Janine
Nah nah nah nah nah nah, nah nah nah

Janine, Janine, you'd like to know me well
But I've got things inside my head
That even I can't face

Janine, Janine, you'd like to crash my walls
But if you take an axe to me
You'll kill another man
Not me at all

(Appears on a demo tape recorded by David Bowie and John 'Hutch' Hutchinson in April 1969).

Scares me into gloom

Jeepster

(Marc Bolan)

You're so sweet
You're so fine
I want you all and everything
Just to be mine

'Cos you're my babe
'Cos you're my love
Girl I'm just a jeepster
For your love

You slide so good
With bones so fair
You've got the universe
Reclining in your hair

Just like a car
You're pleasing to behold
I'll call you Jaguar
If I may be so bold

The wild winds blow
Upon your frozen cheek
The way you flip your hip
It always makes me weak

Your motivation
Is so sweet
Your vibrations
Are burning up my fee

Girl I'm just a jeepster
For your love
Girl I'm just a vampire
For your love

I'm gonna suck you!

Jewel

(Frank Black/David Bowie/Reeves Gabrels/Mark Plati)


I'm leaving my heart, a boy's heart
I'm leaving it far behind
I'm going for mine, I'm painting my lips
Yeah, I'm getting my shoes shined
I'm leaving my heart, my bleeding heart
My shiny shoes, my rosy cheeks
I cut out my heart, I open the door
I'm so happy without my heart
Now I'm screaming "Oh my jewel" so happily
Without my heart
I am a man and I am cruel, I'm the king of cruelty
I'm the king of cruelty

I believe my face, a girl's face
I believe my face is one of a kind
I point the stars and roll my eyes
They poison my young mind
Believe my face, the charming face
My poison eyes, believe my eyes
I roll up my sleeves, I rock on my heels
But I'm nothing without my face
And now I'm screaming "Oh my jewel" so happily
I'm lonely without my face
I am a man and I am cruel, I'm the king of cruelty
I'm nothing without my face
But now I'm screaming "Oh my jewel" so happily
I am a man and I am cruel, I'm the king of cruelty
I'm the king of cruelty
I'm the king of cruelty

And now I'm screaming "Oh my jewel" so happily
I am a man and I am cruel, I'm the king of cruelty
And now I'm screaming "Oh my jewel" so happily
I am a man and I am cruel, I'm the king of cruelty
And now I'm screaming "Oh my jewel" so happily

I am a man and I am cruel, I'm the king of cruelty
And now I'm screaming "Oh my jewel" so happily
I am a man and I am cruel, I'm the king of cruelty
And now I'm screaming "Oh my jewel" so happily
I am a man and I am cruel, I'm the king of cruelty
Now I'm screaming
I am a man, I am
Now I'm screaming - LA! LA!
Now I'm screaming





Joe The Lion

 

Joe the lion
Went to the bar
A couple of drinks on the house and he said
"Tell you who you are if you nail me to my car"

Boy
Thanks for hesitating
This is the kiss off

Boy
Thanks for hesitating
You'll never know the real story
Just a couple of dreams
You get up and sleep

You can buy God
It's Monday
You slither down the greasy pipe
So far so good no one saw you
Hobble over any freeway
You will be like your dreams tonight

You get up and sleep
You get up and sleep
Joe the lion
Made of iron

Joe the lion
Went to the bar
A couple of drinks on the house an' he was
A fortune teller he said
"Nail me to my car and I'll tell you who you are"

Joe the lion, yeah yeah
Went to the bar, yeah yeah
A couple of dreams and he was
A fortune teller he said
"Nail me to my car, tell you who you are"

You get up and sleep
The wind blows on your check
The day laughs in your face
Guess you'll buy a gun
You'll buy it secondhand
An' you'll get up and sleep

Joe the lion made of iron (repeat ad inf.)

John. I'm Only Dancing

 

Well, Ann is pretty neat, she always eats her meat
Joe is awful strong, bet your life he's putting us on
Oh Lordy, oh Lordy, you know I need some loving
I'm moving, touch me!

(CHORUS)
John, I'm only dancing
She turns me on, but I'm only dancing
She turns me on, don't get me wrong
I'm only dancing

Ah shadow love was quick and clean, life's a well thumbed machine
I saw you watching from the stairs, you're everyone that ever cared
Oh Lordy, oh Lordy, you know I need some loving

Won't you let me slam my thing in?

(Falling) I think it's all I can do

(Dancing) I tell you confidently
If he gives it to you, he'd better take it from me

(Sad sad) I'll pick up your bones
(Sad sad) Leave the numbers alone
(Sad sad) Get off your telephone
Looking people in the eye, tell them "my, oh, my"
Let your backbone slide while you whistle and cry

Join The Gang

 

Let me introduce you to the gang
Johnny plays the sitar, he's an existentialist
Once he had a name, now he plays our game
You won't feel so good now that you've joined the gang

Molly is the model in the ads
Crazy clothes and acid full of soul and crazy hip
Someone switched her on, then her beam went wrong
'Cos she can't switch off now that she's joined the gang

Arthur is a singer with a band
Arthur drinks two bottles just before he goes on stage
Look at Arthur rave, all the kids are paid
They want to see the croaking man who joined the gang

You won't be alone, we've all got beery grins
It's a big illusion but at least you're in
At least you're in

This club's called The Webb, it's this month's pick
Next month we shall find a place where prices aren't so stiff
15 bob a Coke, 'fraid that's past a joke
This is how to spend now that you've joined the gang

This is what to do now that you're here
Sit round doing nothing all together very fast
Psychedelic stars, throwing down cigars
They're picking up the joints now that they've joined the gang




Julie

 

Julie
Oh
And I know

Like a mirror, Sunday morning
When the dark clouds hung above
I saw you kneeling 'neath a garden
I saw the grim and stood above

What kind of meaning in a gun shot
It doesn't matter what they say
I never felt I aimed at no one
And who's gonna take the gun away

Julie
Pretend for me
That I'm someone in your life

Julie
I'm yours till the end
All the days and memories

I'm not a man of single reason
It's in every single man
This beat of jealous retribution
And every spurned heart makes its plan

Well, I know that you really loved him
And I know that if there's a God above
Through million times we'll remember
How the trail slips away

Julie
Pretend for me
Even only for a while

Julie
My soul is on the line
All the days and memories

Julie
Remember me
All the days of your life

Julie
I'm lost over you
Passion always ends this way
End this way




Jump They Say

 

When comes the shaking man
A nation in his eyes
Striped with blood and emblazed tattoo
Streaking cathedral spire

They say
  'He has no brain'
They say
  'He has no mood'
They say
  'He was born again'
They say
  'Look at him climb'
They say "Jump"

They say
  'He has two Gods'
They say
  'He has no fear'
They say
  'He has no eyes'
They say
  'He has no mouth'

They say 'hey that's really something'
They feel he should get some time
I say he should watch his ass
My friend don't listen to the crowd
They say "Jump"

Got to believe somebody
Got to believe




Jump They Say 

 




(Recorded for Jump - The David Bowie Interactive CD-ROM).





Karma Man

 

Fingertip sunlit sideshow stalls, they throw the balls
At coconut fur that hides behind coloured shades that blind your eyes
Every child's mother holds an ice-cream cone, they circle round
Perceived unknown by an eye that peers from a hole in the tent where no one goes
A figure sitting cross-legged on the floor
He's cloaked and clothed in saffron robes
His beads are all he owns

Slow down, slow down
Someone must have said that slowed him down
Slow down, slow down
It's pictured on the arms of the Karma Man

Fairy tale skin, depicting scenes from human zoos
Impermanent toys like peace and war
A gentle face you've seen before
Karma Man tattooed on your side, the wheel of life
I see my times and who I've been
I only live now and I don't know why
I struggle hard to take these pictures in, but
All my friends can see is just the pinkness of his skin

Slow down, slow down
Someone must have said that slowed him down
Slow down, slow down
It's pictured on the arms of the Karma Man

Slow down, slow down
Someone must have said that slowed him down
Slow down, slow down
It's pictured on the arms of the Karma Man




Kingdom Come

(Tom Verlaine)

Well I walked in the pouring rain
And I heard a voice that cries "It's all in vain"
The voice of doom was shining in my room
I just need one day somewhere far away
Lord I just need one day

Well I'll be breaking these rocks
And cutting this hay
Yes I'll be breaking these rocks
What's my price to pay?

Well the river's so muddy, but it may come clear
And I know too well what's keeping me here
I'm just the slave of a burning ray
Oh give me the night, I can't take another sight
Please, please give me the night

CHORUS

Sun keeps beating down on me, wall's a mile high
Up in the tower they're watching me hoping I'm gonna die

I won't be breaking no rocks
I said "I won't be breaking no rocks"

(I won't be breaking no rocks) Oh-oh-oh
(I won't be breaking no rocks) Oh-oh-oh
(I won't be breaking no rocks)
When the kingdom comes (repeat ad inf.)




Kingdom Come - (earlier version)

(Tom Verlaine)

Well I walk in the pouring rain
And I heard a voice that cries "It's all in vain"
It was a voice of doom shining in my room
I just need one day, somewhere far away
Lord I just need one day

'Cos it's breaking these rocks
And cutting this hay
Yes I've been breaking these rocks
It was my price to pay

Well the river's so muddy, but it may come clear
And I know too well yeah what's keeping me here
Oh yeah I'm just a slave of a burning rays
And give the night, I can't take another sight
Please please give me the night

'Cos I've been breaking these rocks
And cutting this hay
Yes I've been breaking these rocks
It was my price to pay

Sun keeps beating down on me, the wall's a mile high
Up in the tower they're watching me, hoping hoping I'm gonna gonna gonna die

Yeah I've been over these hills
I won't be breaking no rocks
I see over these hills
I won't be breaking no rocks
And my hope that those ???
Well pardon me
I won't be breaking no rocks (3 times)
When the kingdom comes (3 times)
I won't be breaking no rocks (2 times)

(From demo sessions recorded in 1980 for the Scary Monsters (And Super Creeps) album).





Knock On Wood

(Eddie Floyd/Steve Cropper)

I don't wanna lose the good thing that I've got
If I have do, I will surely, I will lose a lot

For your love is better than any love other I've known
It's like thunder, lightning
The way you love me is frightening
I better knock on wood
Baby

I got superstitious about you, but I can't take a change
You got me spinning, baby, spinning in a trance
But your love is better than any other love I've known
It's like thunder, lightning
The way you love me is frightening
You better knock on wood

Yeah

It's no secret, but that woman fills my lovin' cup
She sees to it, that I get enough
And her love is better than any other love I've known
It's like thunder
It's like lightning, yeah
The way you love me is frightening
I better knock on wood
Baby
Ahh yeah
(Yes you better knock, knock, knock on wood) I better knock
(Yes you better knock, knock, knock on wood) Oh, knock on wood
(Yes you better knock, knock, knock on wood) You know I would, yeah, alright
(Yes you better knock, knock, knock on wood) It's no secret
(Yes you better knock, knock, knock on wood) No, oh, better
(Yes you better knock, knock, knock on wood) Than I've known
(Yes you better knock, knock, knock on wood) I can't leave her alone
(Yes you better knock, knock, knock on wood) Oh no, baby
Knock on wood, woo!




Kooks

 

Will you stay in our lovers' story
If you stay you won't be sorry
'Cos we believe in you
Soon you'll grow so take a chance
With a couple of Kooks
Hung up on romancing

Will you stay in our lovers' story
If you stay you won't be sorry
'Cos we believe in you
Soon you'll grow so take a chance
With a couple of Kooks
Hung up on romancing

We bought a lot of things to keep you warm and dry
And a funny old crib on which the paint won't dry
I bought you a pair of shoes
A trumpet you can blow
And a book of rules
And what to say to people when they pick on you
'Cos if you stay with us you're gonna be pretty kooky too

Will you stay in my lovers' story
If you stay you won't be sorry
'Cos we believe in you
Soon you'll grow so take a chance
With a couple of Kooks
Hung up on romancing

And if you ever have to go to school
Remember how they messed up this old fool
Don't pick fights with the bullies or the cads
'Cos I'm not much cop at punching other people's Dads
And if the homework brings you down
Then we'll throw it on the fire
And take the car down town

Will you stay in our lovers' story
If you stay you won't be sorry
'Cos we believe in you
Soon you'll grow so take a chance
With a couple of Kooks
Hung up on romancing

(repeat chorus ad inf.)




Lady Grinning Soul

 

She'll come, she'll go
She'll lay belief on you
Skin sweet with musky oil
The lady from another grinning soul

Cologne she'll wear, Silver and Americard
She'll drive a Beetle car
And beat you down at cool Canasta

And when the clothes are strewn, don't be afraid of the room
Touch the fullness of her breast
Feel the love of her caress
She will be your living end

She'll come, she'll go
She'll lay belief on you
But she won't stake her life on you
How can life become her point of view?

And when the clothes are strewn, don't be afraid of the room
Touch the fullness of her breast
Feel the love of her caress
She will be your living end (repeat x5)




Lady Stardust (demo)

 

People stared at the make-up on his face
Laughed at his long black hair, his animal grace
The boy in the bright blue jeans
Jumped up on the stage
And Lady Stardust sang her songs
Of darkness and dismay

CHORUS
  And he was alright, the band was altogether
  And he was alright, his song went on forever
  And he was awful nice
  Really quite out of sight
  And he sang all night long

The femme fatales emerged from shadows
To watch this creature fair
Boys stood upon their chairs
To make their point of view
And I smiled sadly for a love I could not obey
And Lady Stardust sang his songs
Of darkness and dismay

CHORUS
  And he was alright, the band was altogether
  And he was alright, his song went on forever
  And he was awful nice
  Really quite out of sight
  And he sang, all night long

Oh how I lied when they asked if I knew his name

CHORUS
  For he was alright, the band was altogether
  And he was alright, his song went on forever
  And he was awful nice
  Really quite paradise
  And he sang all night long

La la la la (etc)




Lady Stardust

Of darkness and disgrace

CHORUS

  Yes he was alright, the song went on forever
  Yes he was awful nice

  He was, awful nice
  Really quite paradise
  He sang, all night long

Law (Earthlings On Fire)

(Lyrics: David Bowie. Music: David Bowie/Reeves Gabrels)

I don't want knowledge
I want certainty (x3)

On the street
A man shouts out loud
A wallet drops
And money flies into the midday sun

With the sound, with the sound, with the sound of the ground (x3)
Sure I get a little bit afraid
Sometimes

Earthlings on fire (x2)

CHORUS
  With the sound, with the sound, with the sound of the ground (x3)
  Sure I get a little bit afraid

Sometimes

Earthlings on fire (x4)

I don't want knowledge, I want certainty (x2)

In a room a man drops dead
As he hits the floor he sighs
"What a morning"

CHORUS (x2)

Sometimes

Earthlings on fire (repeat to last verse as backing vocals)

Sure I get a little bit afraid
Sometimes

I don't want knowledge, I want certainty (x2)
Oh I get a little bit afraid
Sometimes

I don't want knowledge, I want certainty (x2)
I don't want knowledge




Lazer

 

Let's hear it for the gouster (yeah)
Baggy pants and a watch chain
Dressed down like the spirit and his game
But mirror, mirror on the wall sees all
But your doo-wop rag made you look tough
Razor blades in her bra
Mirror, mirror on the wall

I am the laser
Burning through your eyes
And I know what kind of flame you have
I know what fear you hide

Hear it for the T-shirt
Oh those crew cuts that hurt
Clicking jigaboo so Lenny Bruce
Mirror, mirror on the wall sees all
Dog tooth or paisley?
Processed or strained?
But mirror, mirror on the wall says

I am the laser
Burning through your lies
You'll join my other world some day
Then gaze in through outside

I am the laser
Burning through your lies
You'll join my other world some day
You'll gaze in through outside

Oh yeah!

(Recorded during the Young Americans sessions on 13th August 1974 at the Sigma Sound Studios in Philadelphia, USA).

Let Me Sleep Beside You

 

Baby, baby, brush the dust of youth from off your shoulder
Because the years of threading daisies lie behind you now
Don't return to fields of green where rainbow secrets were told
Place your ragged doll with all the toys and things and deeds
I will show you game where the winner never wins

CHORUS
  Let your hair hang down, wear the dress your mother wore
  Let me sleep beside you

Lock away your childhood and throw away the key
For now the streets and city sounds will burn your eyes as coals
We shall drink the oldest wine and velvet skies will linger
Child, you're a woman now, your heart and soul are free
I will hold a lighted lamp and we shall walk together

CHORUS

Your darkened eyes throw mystery
But your lips are void of history
You could not imagine that it could happen this way, could you?
I will give you dreams and I'll tell you things you'd like to hear

CHORUS

Let me sleep beside you




Let Me Sleep Beside You (2000 version)

 

Baby, baby, brush the dust of youth from off your shoulder
Because the years of threading daisies lie behind you
Don't return to fields of green where rainbow secrets were told
Place your ragged doll with all the toys and things and deeds
Even I will show you game where the winner never wins

CHORUS
  Let your hair hang down, wear the dress your mother wore
  Let me sleep beside you

Lock away your childhood and throw away the key
Now the streets and city sights will burn your eyes as coals
We shall drink the oldest wine and velvet skies will linger
Child, you're a woman now, your heart and soul are free (yeah)
I will hold a lighted lamp but we shall walk together

CHORUS
  Let your hair hang down, wear the dress your mother wore
  Let me sleep beside you

Your darkened eyes throw mystery
But your lips are void of history
You could not imagine that it could happen this way, could you?

I will give you dreams and I'll tell you things you'd like to hear

CHORUS
  Let your hair hang down, wear the dress your mother wore
  Let me sleep beside you
  I said let your hair hang down, wear the dress your mother wore
  Let me sleep beside you

Let's dance    For fear tonight is all

Let's Dance

(Jim Lee)

(One, two)
(One, two, three, four)

Hey baby won't you take a chance?
Say that you'll let me have this dance

Well let's dance, well let's dance
We'll do the twist, the stomp, the mashed potato too
Any old dance that you wanna do
But let's dance, well let's dance

Hey baby, yeah, you thrill me so
Hold me tight, don't you let me go

But let's dance, well let's dance
We'll do the twist, the stomp, the mashed potato too
Any old dance that you wanna do
But let's dance, well let's dance

Hey, baby, if you're all alone
Maybe you'll let me walk you home

But let's dance, well let's dance
We'll do the twist, the stomp, the mashed potato too
Any old dance that you wanna do
But let's dance, well let's dance

Hey, baby, things are swingin' right
Yes, I know that this is the night

Well let's dance, well let's dance
We'll do the twist, the stomp, the mashed potato too
Any old dance that you wanna do
But let's dance, well let's dance

But let's dance
But let's dance
But let's dance

(Performed live with Tina Turner at the NEC Birmingham on 23rd March 1985. Tonight and Let's Dance medley).





Let's Spend The Night Together

(Mick Jagger/Keith Richard)

Well, don't you worry 'bout what's been on my mind
I'm in no hurry I can take my time
I'm going red and my tongue's getting tired
Out of my head and my mouth's getting dry
I'm h-h-h-high

CHORUS
  Let's spend the night together
  Now I need you more than ever
  Let's spend the night together now

I feel so strong that I can't disguise, oh my
Well, I just can't apologise, no
Don't hang me up but don't let me down
We could have fun just by fooling around, and around and around

CHORUS

Oh
You know I'm smiling baby
You need some guiding baby
I'm just deciding baby

CHORUS

This doesn't happen to me every day
No excuses I've got anyway, hey
I'll satisfy your every need
And I'll know you'll satisfy me, oh my-my-my my-my

(Three times):
  Let's spend the night together
  Now I need you more than ever

Let's spend the night together
(Spoken):
They said we were too young
Our kind of love was no fun
But our love comes from above
Do it!
Let's make love
Whoo!

CHORUS




Let's Twist Again

(Kal Mann/Dave Appell)

 


(Demo supposedly recorded with John Lennon in 1975).





Letter To Hermione

 

The hand that wrote this letter
Sweeps the pillow clean
So rest your head and read a treasured dream
I care for no one else but you
I tear my soul to cease the pain
I think maybe you feel the same
What can we do?
I'm not quite sure what we're supposed to do
So I've been writing just for you

They say your life is going very well
They say you sparkle like a different girl
But something tells me that you hide
When all the world is warm and tired
You cry a little in the dark
Well so do I
I'm not quite sure what you're supposed to say
But I can see it's not okay

He makes you laugh
He brings you out in style
He treats you well
And makes you up real fine
And when he's strong
He's strong for you
And when you kiss
It's something new
But did you ever call my name
Just by mistake?
I'm not quite sure what I'm supposed to do
So I'll just write some love to you




Liebe Dich Bis Dienstag

(David Bowie. Translation: Lisa Busch)

Schau aus Deinem Fenster
Schau wer draussen sitzt
Ich bin still hier wartend
Schon die ganze Nacht
Wenn Du dann Dein Haus verlaesst
Klingle ich und rufe
Ah, mein kleines Maedchen
Mein brennend Verlangen erwarchte Sonntag
Gib mir Dein Herz und ich liebe dich bis Dienstag

Who's that hiding in the apple tree
Clinging to a branch?
Don't be afraid, it's only me
Hoping for a little romance
If you lie beneath my shade
I'll keep you nice and cool

Ah, beautiful baby
I was very lonely till I met you on Sunday
My passion's never ending
And I'll love you till Tuesday

Let the wind blow through your hair
Be nice to the big blue sea
Don't be afraid of the man in the moon
Because it's only me
I shall always want you until my love runs dry

Ah, beautiful baby
My heart's aflame
I'll love you till Tuesday
My head's in a whirl
And I'll love you till Tuesday

Liebe, liebe, liebe, liebe
Liebe Dich bis Dienstag
Liebe, liebe, liebe, liebe
Liebe Dich bis Dienstag

Spoken:  Na ja, vielleicht wirds ja auch Mittwoch?

(German version of Love You Till Tuesday recorded at Trident Studios, Soho, London on 29th January 1969, to be used for an appearance on German television. Part German-English lyrics).




Life Is A Circus - (demo)

(Roger Bunn)

CHORUS
  Life is a circus
  It's not fair
  Life is a hard road
  When you're not there
  At the fair

Friends come to see me
  (and the ...) (point where shall I go)
To see the show
  (to help my friend and foe)
  (all that ..)
When will they realise
  (To laugh and drag my name on the ground)
The circus must go

  (Looking at the strengths of every)

???
Papa he talks to me
Don't try your heart
Gets deep inside you
Does you real harm
Don't you care?

Life ??
  (and the ...)
Stand straight and tall
  (to help my friend and foe)
  (Why let them fight) (Don't lose you balance) (Oh let them fight)
Fight your
Christ don't tell

(Appears on a demo tape recorded by David Bowie and John 'Hutch' Hutchinson in April 1969. Song composed in 1966 by Roger Bunn of 4-piece vocal group Djinn).





Life On Mars?

 

It's a God-awful small affair
To the girl with the mousy hair
But her mummy is yelling "No"
And her daddy has told her to go
But her friend is nowhere to be seen
Now she walks through her sunken dream
To the seat with the clearest view
And she's hooked to the silver screen
But the film is a saddening bore
For she's lived it ten times or more
She could spit in the eyes of fools
As they ask her to focus on

Sailors fighting in the dance hall
Oh man! Look at those cavemen go
It's the freakiest show
Take a look at the Lawman
Beating up the wrong guy
Oh man! Wonder if he'll ever know
He's in the best selling show
Is there life on Mars?

It's on Amerika's tortured brow
That Mickey Mouse has grown up a cow
An' now the workers have struck for fame
'Cos Lennon's on sale again
See the mice in their million hordes
From Ibiza to the Norfolk Broads
Rule Britannia is out of bounds
To my Mother, my dog, and clowns
But the film is a saddening bore
'Cos I wrote it ten times or more
It's about to be writ again
As I ask you to focus on

Sailors fighting in the dance hall
Oh man! Look at those cavemen go
It's the freakiest show
Take a look at the Lawman
Beating up the wrong guy
Oh man! Wonder if he'll ever know
He's in the best selling show
Is there life on Mars?
(Telephone rings: "I think that's the one". "Okay").




Lightning Frightening

 

I'll give you back my farm and I'll give you back my house
I'll give you back my right to be free
I've got moon, I've got sun
Lightning, lightning, lightning
I've got me, I've got you
Frightening, frightening, frightening

I'll give you back my farm and I'll give you back my house
I'll give you back my right to be free
I'll give you back my farm and I'll give you back my house
I'll give you back my right to be free
I've got moon, I've got sun
(I've got) Lightning, lightning, lightning
I've got me, I've got you
(It's) Frightening, frightening, frightening




Like A Rolling Stone

(Bob Dylan)

Yeah
How does it feel?
How does it feel?

Once upon a time you dressed so fine
Threw the bums a dime in your prime, didn't you
People called, say "Beware doll, you're bound to fall"
Thought they were all kidding you
You used to laugh about
Everybody that was hanging out
Now you don't talk so loud
Now you don't seem so proud
About having to be scrounging for your next meal

How does it feel?
How does it feel?
To be without a home
Like a complete unknown
Just like a rolling stone

You've gone to the finest school, Miss Lonely
But you know you only used to get juiced in it
No one ever taught you how to live on the street
You're gonna have to get used to it
You said you'd never compromise
With the mystery tramp, but now you realize
He's not selling any alibi's
As you stare into the vacuum of his eyes
And you ask him if you want to make a deal

How does it feel?
How does it feel?
To be on your own
Like a complete unknown
Just like a rolling stone

Tell me
Tell me
Tell me
Yeah

"Oh, rock Ronno, rock"

You never turned around to catch the frowns on the jugglers and clowns
When they all did their tricks for you
You never understood that it ain't no good
To let other people get your kicks for you
You used to ride a chrome horse with your diplomat
Who carried on his shoulder a Siamese cat
Ain't it hard to discover that
He really wasn't where it's at
After he took from you everything he could steal

How does it feel?
How does it feel?
To be on your own
Like a complete unknown
To be without a home
Just like a rolling stone
Just like a rolling stone
Just like a rolling stone




Little Bombardier

 

War made him a soldier
Little Frankie Mair
Peace left him a loser
The little bombardier

Lines of worry appeared with age
Unskilled hands that knew no trade
Spent his time in the picture house
The little bombardier

Frankie drank his money
The little that he made
Told his woes to no man
Friendless, lonely days

Then one day, in the ABC
Four bright eyes gazed longingly
At the ice-cream in the hand of the little bombardier

Sunshine entered our Frankie's days
Gone his worries, his hopeless maze
His life was fun and his heart was full of joy

Two young children had changed his aims
He gave them toffees and played their games
He bought them presents with every coin he made

Then two gentlemen called on him
Asked him for his name
Why was he friends with the children
Were they just a game?

Leave them alone or we'll get sore
We've had blokes like you in the station before
The hand of authority said "no more" to
The little bombardier

Packed his bags, his heart in pain
Wiped a tear and caught a train
Not to be seen in the town again
The little bombardier




Little Egypt

(Jerry Leiber/Mike Stoller)

I went and bought myself a ticket and I sat down in the very first row
They pulled the curtain but then when they turned the spotlight way down low
Little Egypt came out a-struttin' wearin' nothin' but a button and a bow
Singing, ying-ying, ying-ying, ying-ying, ying-ying

She had a ruby on her tummy and a diamond big as Texas on her toe
She let her hair down and she did the hoochie-coochie real slow
When she did her special number on the zebra skin 
I thought she'd stop the show
Singing, ying-ying, ying-ying, ying-ying, ying-ying

She did her triple somersault and when she hit the ground
She winked at the audience and then she turned around
She had a picture of a cowboy tattooed on her spine
Said, Phoenix, Arizona 1949

Yeah, let me tell you people 
Little Egypt doesn't dance there anymore
She's too busy mopping and a-takin' care of shopping at the store
'Cos we've got seven kids and all day long they crawl around the floor
Singing ying-ying, ying-ying, ying-ying, ying-ying

(Cover version of The Coasters hit song performed live by Davy Jones and The Manish Boys).





Little Miss Emperor

(Iggy Pop/David Bowie)

You're not giving an inch
You're not strung like wire
Your open arms they flinch
Joan Crawford style
Treated like a towel
Inside you howl

On some dark concrete
Midnight street
You've built an altar
That's quite complete
Your self control
Is damned amazing
You're trying hard
And I want you
Little Miss Emperor

You really want to grow
And you're alert, I know
But babies mostly drown
It's a company town
Cheat Gods and joke
Attack your noble ghost

I saw the best minds
Of my generation
Learn how to crawl
Across our nation
Conformity falls
Like one wet blanket
Look how we live
And I want you
Little Miss Emperor
Little Miss Emperor
Trying to open doors




Little Toy Soldier

 

Once upon a time there was a toy soldier
And he lived in the playroom
Once upon a time there was a toy soldier
With a whiplash in his hand

And every night little girl Sadie would take all her clothes off
And wind up the toy solider
And he'd raise his whip and say to her

CHORUS
  "On your knees, little Sadie
  Little Sadie on your knees
  Taste the whip and love not given lightly
  Taste the whip and bleed for me"

Little Sadie loved her little toy soldier
And she'd run home from school each day
Little Sadie loved her little toy soldier
And she'd lock the door so she could play

Little Sadie got ambitious and
Wound the clockwork soldier tighter
So he could whip her harder and harder

CHORUS

One day, Sadie wound and wound
And wound and wound
And wound and wound
Till suddenly
The little toy soldier's spring went
  Woo-woo-woo-woo-woo
  Arrgghhhh!

And he beat her to death!

(Recorded with The Riot Squad at the Decca Studios in April 1969. Sessions produced by Gus Dudgeon).





Little Wonder

(Lyrics: David Bowie. Music: David Bowie/Reeves Gabrels/Mark Plati)

Stinky weather fat
Shaky hand
Dopey morning Doc
Grumpy gnomes

Little wonder then

Big screen dolls
Tits and explosions
Sleepy time
Bashful but nude

Little wonder then
Little wonder
You little wonder
Little wonder you

Enter galactic
See me to be you
It's all in the tablets
Sneezy Bhutan

Little wonder then
Little wonder
You little wonder
Little wonder you

Mars happy nation
Sit on my karma
Dame meditation
Take me away

Little wonder then
Little wonder
You little wonder
Little wonder you

CHORUS
  Sending me so far away, so far away
  So far away, so far away (x4)
  So far away, so so far away
  So far away, so far away
  So far away, so so far away

  Little wonder
  You little wonder, you
  Little wonder
  You little wonder you

??

CHORUS

You little wonder, little wonder you
Little wonder then, little wonder
You little wonder, little wonder you

London Bye, Ta-Ta

 

CHORUS
  London bye, ta-ta
  Strange young town
  London bye, ta-ta
  Brought me down
  Don't like your new face
  That's not nice
  Got to go far far
  London bye, ta-ta

Gigi, Gigi
Take me away
Gigi, Gigi
Take me today
The boys in the clothes shop
Sold me curry for a pound
His cardboard face is soggy
And he's selling thorny crowns

I loved her!
I loved her!
I've got to get away now
But I loved her!

CHORUS

Red light, green light
Make up your mind
Red light, green light
You're far too unkind
She loves to love all beauty
And she says the norm is funny
But she whimpers in the morning
When she finds she has no money

I loved her!
I loved her!
I've got to get away now
But I loved her!
Ahhh!

CHORUS

Oh, London bye, ta-ta

(Lyrics: Ivan Mogul. Music: David Bowie)

(English translation of Ragazzo Solo, Ragazza Sola)

My thoughts have blown in the wind
One thought, just one
I walk while the city sleeps
Her eyes in the night
White neon in the night
A voice, who's could it be?
Tell me lonely boy, where are you going?

Why is there so much pain?
You have lost, without a doubt, a great love
But the city is full of love
No lonely girl, no no no
This time you're in the wrong
No I have not lost everything with her
The colours of life, the blue skies
I will never find anyone like her again
Well, lonely boy, where are you going?

The night is a big sea
If you need my hand to swim
Thank you, but tonight I want to die
Because you know in my eyes
Is an angel, an angel
That will no longer fly
She is there, the colours of life, the blue skies
I will never find anyone like her again

Love You Till Tuesday

 

Just look through your window, look who sits outside
Little me is waiting, standing through the night
When you walk out through your door I'll wave my flag and shout

Ohh, beautiful baby
My burning desire started on Sunday
Give me your heart and I'll love you till Tuesday

Da da da dum (x4)

Who's that hiding in the apple tree, clinging to a branch
Don't be afraid it's only me, hoping for a little romance
If you lie beneath my shade, I'll keep you nice and cool

Ohh, beautiful baby
I was very lonely till I met you on Sunday
My passion's never-ending and I'll love you till Tuesday

Da da da dum (x7)

Let the wind blow through your hair, be nice to the big blue sea
Don't be afraid of the man in the moon, because it's only me
I shall always watch you until my love runs dry

Ohh, beautiful baby
My heart's aflame, I'll love you till Tuesday
My head's in a whirl and I'll love you till Tuesday
Love, love, love, love you till Tuesday
Love, love, love, love you till Tuesday

Da da da dum (x11)

Well, I might stretch it till Wednesday




Love You Till Tuesday (Demo)

 

Da da da dum (x4)

Ahh, beautiful baby
My burning desire started on Sunday
Give me your heart and I'll love you till Tuesday

Da da da dum (x4)

Who's that hiding in the apple tree, clinging to a branch

My passion's never-ending and I'll love you till Tuesday

I'm the coffee in your coffee, the spoon in your tea
If you've got a problem then it's probably me
I'm hiding every place that you are

Don't be afraid of the man in the moon, 'cos it's only me
I shall always watch you, till my love runs dry

My head's in a whirl and I'll love you till Tuesday
Love, love, love, love you till Tuesday

Loving The Alien

 

Watching them come and go
The Templars and the Saracens
They're travelling the Holy Land
Opening telegrams (oh oh)

Torture comes and torture goes
Knights who'd give you anything
They bear the cross of Coeuf de Leon
Salvation for the mirror blind (woah oh)

But if you pray all your sins are hooked upon the sky
Pray and the heathen lie will disappear
Prayers they hide the saddest view
  (Believing the strangest things, loving the alien)
And your prayers they break the sky in two
  (Believing the strangest things, loving the alien)
You pray till the break of dawn
  (Believing the strangest things, loving the alien)
And you'll believe you're loving the alien
  (Believing the strangest things, loving the alien)

Thinking of a different time
Palestine a modern problem
Bounty and your wealth in land
Terror in a best laid plan (woah oh)

Watching them come and go
Tomorrows and the yesterday's
Christians and the unbelievers
Hanging by the cross and nail (woah oh)




Lucy Can't Dance

 

Lucy I know what you're going to going to do
Oh Lucy look what you're doing I'm doing it too
Now you're looking for God in exciting new ways
I say trust him at once which is something these days

Lucy can't dance to the noise but she knows what the noise can do
Lucy can't dance to the noise but she knows what the noise can do

Did the world just explode?
Don't recognise anyone
But you've still got me under your thumb

Lucy can't dance to the noise but she knows what the noise can do

There's tooling your frenzy in the Tole Savoy
And the sexual noise which is caught up a toy
You live and you die in the blink of an eye
Well I can't make you dance
Dance to the noise

Lucy can't dance but she knows what the noise can do
Dance to the noise
Lucy can't dance but she knows what the noise can do

Lucy I know what you're going to going to do
But you can't buy me off in the sterile world
Who who who died and made you material girl?

Lucy can't dance to the noise but she knows what the noise can do

So I'll spin while my lunatic lyric goes wrong
Guess I'll put all my eggs in a post modern song

Lucy can't dance to the noise but she knows what the noise can do

Oh this fellow are mocked by reality
Just a few simple words like I love you, I need you
Live and you die in the blink of an eye
Still I can't make you dance
Dance to the noise

Lucy can't dance but she knows what the noise can do




Lust For Life

(Lyrics: Iggy Pop. Music: David Bowie)

Here comes Johnny Yen again
With the liquor and drugs
And the flesh machine
He's gonna do another striptease
Hey man where'd you get
That lotion? I been hurting
Since I bought the gimmick
About something called love
Yeah something called love
That's like hypnotizing chickens
Well I am just a modern guy
Of course I've had it in the ear before
'Cos of a lust for life
'Cos of a lust for life
I'm worth a million in prizes
With my torture film
Drive a G.T.O.
Wear a uniform
All on a government loan
I'm worth a million in prizes
Yeah I'm through with sleeping on the
Sidewalk - no more beating my brains
With the liquor and drugs
With the liquor and drugs
Well I am just a modern guy
Of course I've had it in the ear before
'Cos of a lust for life
'Cos of a lust for life
I got a lust for life
Got a lust for life
Oh a lust for life
Oh a lust for life
A lust for life
I got a lust for life
I got a lust for life
Well I am just a modern guy
Of course I've had it in the ear before
'Cos of a lust for life
'Cos of a lust for life
'Cos of a lust for life

Here comes Johnny Yen again
With the liquor and drugs
And the flesh machine
He's gonna do another striptease
Hey man where'd you get
That lotion? Your skin starts
Itching once you buy the gimmick
About something called love
Oh love love love
That's like hypnotizing chickens
Well I am just a modern guy
Of course I've had it in the ear before
'Cos of a lust for life
'Cos of a lust for life
Got a lust for life
Yeah a lust for life
I got a lust for life
Oh a lust for life
I got a lust for life
Yeah a lust for life
I got a lust for life
A lust for life
Lust for life
Lust for life




Madman

(Marc Bolan/Steve Harley)

When a man is a man, he's destructive
When a man is a man, he's seductive
When a woman is a sensitive thing
When a woman is a woman, he's a madman
Madman - Madman- Madman - Madman

When a man is a friend, he's a stranger
When a man is a man, he's no angel
When a woman is a sensitive thing
When a woman is a woman, he's a madman

Maggie's Farm

(Bob Dylan)

I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more
No, I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more
Well, I wake in the morning
Fold my hands and pray for rain
I got a head full of ideas
That are drivin' me insane
It's a shame the way she makes me scrub the floor
I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more

I ain't gonna work for Maggie's brother no more
No, I ain't gonna work for Maggie's brother no more
Well, he hands you a nickel
He hands you a dime
He asks you with a grin
If you're havin' a good time
Then he fines you every time you slam the door
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's brother no more

I ain't gonna work for Maggie's pa no more
No, I ain't gonna work for Maggie's 'Pa no more
Well, he puts his cigar
Out in your face just for kicks
His bedroom window
It is made out of bricks
The National Guard stands around his door
Ah, I ain't gonna work for Maggie's pa no more

I ain't gonna work for Maggie's ma no more
No, I ain't gonna work for Maggie's 'ma no more
Well, she talks to all the servants
About man and God and law
Everybody says
She's the brains behind pa
She's sixty-eight, but she says she's twenty-four
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's ma no more

I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more
No, I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more
Well, I try my best
To be just like I am
But everybody wants you
To be just like them
They sing while you slave and I just get bored
I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more

(Performed live with Tin Machine during the 1989 tour).





Magic Dance

 

You remind me of the baby
What baby? The baby with the power
What power? Power of voodoo
Who do? You do
Do what? Remind me of the baby

I saw my baby, crying hard as babe could cry
What could I do?
My baby's love had gone
And left my baby blue
Nobody knew

CHORUS
  What kind of magic spell to use?
  Slime and snails
  Or puppy dogs' tails
  Thunder or lightning
  Then baby said
  Dance magic, dance (dance magic, dance)
  Dance magic, dance (dance magic, dance)
  Put that baby spell on me
  Jump magic, jump (jump magic, jump)
  Jump magic, jump (jump magic, jump)

And left my baby blue
Nobody knew

Dance magic, dance (dance magic, dance) (x4)
Jump magic, jump (jump magic, jump) (x2)

What kind of magic spell to use?
Slime and snails
Or puppy dogs' tails
Thunder or lightning
Something frightening

Maid Of Bond Street

 

This girl is made of lipstick
Powder and paint
Sees the pictures of herself
Every magazine on every shelf

This girl is maid of Bond Street
Hailing cabs, lunches with executives
Gleaming teeth sip aperitifs

This girl is a lonely girl
Takes the train from Paddington to Oxford Circus
Buys the Daily News
But passengers don't smile at her, don't smile at her

This girl is made of loneliness
A broken heart
For the boy that she once knew
Doesn't want to know her anymore

And this girl is a lonely girl
Every thing she wants is hers
But she can't make it with the boy she really wants to be with
All the time, to love, all the time

This boy is made of envy
Jealousy
He doesn't have a limousine
Really wants to be a star himself

This girl, her world is made of flashlights and films
Her cares are scraps on the cutting room floor

And maids of Bond Street drive round in chauffeured cars
Maids of Bond Street picture clothes, eyes of stars
Maids of Bond Street shouldn't have worldly cares
Maids of Bond Street shouldn't have love affairs




Man In The Middle

(Mark Pritchett)

Like an inventor
He is a symbol of a new age
He glides above the realms
Of you and me
He flows through your life
And makes you feel quite small
You may sit up in your chair
He doesn't care at all

He's the man in the middle
You can tell which way he lays
He's the man in the middle
And he realises
And he realises
And he realises
Beauty pays

His gowns come from Paris
Occasionally from Rome
He can go anywhere
Say back to his home
He flows through your life
And makes you feel quite small
Flashing to the white collars
Ha, he doesn't care at all

He's the man in the middle
You can tell which way he lays
He's the man in the middle
And he realises
And he realises
And he realises
Beauty pays
Please...

He's the man in the middle
You can tell which way he lays
He's the man in the middle
And he realises
And he realises
And he realises
Beauty pays

He's the man in the middle
You can tell which way he lays
He's the man in the middle
And he realises
And he realises
And he realises
Beauty pays
Please...




Man Without A Mouth

(Lyrics: Dave Gutter. Music: Gutter/McNaboe/Zoidis/Albee/Noyes/Roods/Ward)

In the morning, sounds the alarm
Is it a warning, of all the things to come
On my pillow, there is blood
I try to speak but only think of words
Reflecting windows, by the sun
My mouth is gone
Well damn the songs I've sung
If I had known
My mouth is gone

(Chorus)
  When a man, without a mouth
  Lets his dog out    (Oooooooo)
  He just runs away
  It's been so long since he has heard his name    (Oooooooo)
  When a man, without a mouth
  Wants to speak    (Oooooooo)
  He's got things to say

In my car, I hum a tune along to the radio song
When I go to work
It's just like this
Except there's no smile for the receptionist
Except I can't smoke my cigarette
When the boss says I'm late
I can't say back "It's metamorphosis"

Chorus (x2)

Mary Ann

(Ray Charles)

Well now, ol' Mary Ann, you know you sure look fine
Well now, ol' Mary Ann, you know you sure look fine
Well now, ol' Mary Ann, I love you all the time

Well now, ol' Mary Ann, I said baby don't you know
Well now, ol' Mary Ann, I said baby don't you know
Well now, ol' Mary Ann, you know I love you so

Well now, ol' Mary Ann, can I take you home tonight
Well now, ol' Mary Ann, can I take you home tonight
Well now, ol' Mary Ann, I'll make everything all right

(Cover version of Ray Charles song performed live by Davy Jones and The Manish Boys).





Mass Production

(Iggy Pop/David Bowie)

Before you go
Do me a favour
Give me a number
Of a girl almost like you
With legs almost like you
I'm buried deep in mass production
You're not nothing new
I like to drive along the freeways
See the smokestacks belching
Breasts turn brown
So warm and so brown

Though I try to die
You put me back on the line
Oh damn it to hell
Back on the line - hell
Back on the line
Again and again
I'm back on the line
Again and again
And I see my face here
And it's there in the mirror
And it's up in the air
And I'm down on the ground

By the way
I'm going for cigarettes
And since you've gotta go
Won't you do me that favour
Won't you give me that number
Won't you get me that girl
Yeah, she's almost like you
Yes, she's almost like you
And I'm almost like him
Yes, I'm almost like him
Yes, I'm almost like him
Yeah, I'm almost like
    him

Memory of a Free Festival



(Spoken: "Maybe I should announce it?
"Should I?
Memory Of A Free Festival")

The children of the Summer's end
Gathered in the dampened grass
We played our songs and felt the London sky
Resting on our hands
It was God's land
It was ragged and naive
It was Heaven

Touch, we touched the very soul
Of holding each and every life
We claimed the very source of joy ran through
It didn't, but it seemed that way
I kissed a lot of people that day

Oh, to capture just one drop of all the ecstasy that swept that afternoon
To paint that love upon a white balloon
And fly it from the toppest top of all the tops
That man has pushed beyon(d) his brain
Satori must be something just the same

We scanned the skies with rainbow eyes and saw machines of every shape and size
We talked with tall Venusians passing through
And Peter tried to climb aboard but the Captain shook his head
And away they soared
Climbing through the ivory vibrant cloud
Someone passed some bliss among the crowd
And we walked back to the road, unchained

"The Sun machine is coming down, and we're gonna have a party, ah-ah-ah
  The Sun machine is coming down, and we're gonna have a party, ah-ah-ah
  The Sun machine is coming down, and we're gonna have a party, ah-ah-ah
  The Sun machine is coming down, and we're gonna have a party, ah-ah-ah
  The Sun machine is coming down, Ooo-ah-ah
  The Sun machine is coming down, and we're gonna have a party, ooo-ah-ah
  The Sun machine is coming down, and we're gonna have a party, ah-ah-ah
  The Sun machine is coming down, and we're gonna have a party, ah-ah-ah
  The Sun machine is coming down, and we're gonna have a party"
(repeat ad inf.)

Miracle Goodnight

 

Burning up each others love, burning up our lives
Tried all kinds of working out, miracle goodnight
Future full and empty knocking on my door
Ragged limbed and hungry mama
Miracle no more

(Skin tell me) turn it around
(Head tell me) make it alright
(Nobody dancing)

Morning star you're beautiful, yellow dime on high
Spin you round my little room, miracle goodnight
Evening flower all alone, puzzling capiche
Haven't got a death wish, just want a little more

CHORUS
  (Skin tell me) turn it around
  (Head tell me) make it alright
  (Nobody dancing) miracle goodnight
  (Breath tell me) turn it around
  (Heart tell me) make it alright
  (Nobody dancing) it was only make believe

I wish I was a sailor a thousand miles from here
I wished I had a future, anywhere

I love you in the morning sun, I love you in my dreams
I love the sound of making love, the feeling of your skin
The corner of your eyes, I long forever more
I never want to say goodnight, miracle goodnight

CHORUS

Don't want to know the past, I want to know the real deal
I really don't want to know that
The less we know, the better we feel

Morning star you're beautiful, yellow diamond high
Spinning around my little room, miracle

CHORUS

(Skin tell me) turn it around
(Moon tell me) make it alright
(Nobody dancing) it was only make believe

(Eyes tell me) turn it around
(News tell me) make it alright
(Nobody dancing)


Mit Mir In Deinem Traum

(David Bowie. Translation: Lisa Busch)

When I live my dream, I'll take you with me
Riding on a golden horse
We'll live within my castle, with people there to serve you
Happy at the sound of your voice

Maybe, I'll slay a dragon for you
Or banish wicked giants from the land
But you will find, that nothing in my dream can hurt you
We will only love each other as forever
When I live my dream

When I live my dream, I'll forgive the things you've told me
And the empty man you left behind
It's a broken heart that dreams, it's a broken heart you left me
Only love can live in my dream

I'll wish, and the thunder clouds will vanish
Wish, and the storm will fade away
Wish again, and you will stand before me while the sky will paint an overture
And trees will play the rhythm of my dream

When I live my dream, please be there to meet me
Let me be the one to understand
When I live my dream, I'll forget the hurt you gave me
Then we can live in our new land

Till the day my dream cascades around me
I'm content to let you pass me by
Till that day, you'll run to many other men
But let them know it's just for now
Erzähl ihnen von meinem Traum
Erzähl ihnen, der Star bist du
Erzähle, ich bin unerhört verträumt
Und mein Traum wird einmal war
Erzähle, dass ich träumen will
Erzähl ihr Lachen stört mich nicht
Vergiss nur nicht dein Rendevous
Mit mir in deinem Traum

(German version of When I Live My Dream, recorded at Trident Studios, Soho, London on 29th January 1969, to be used for an appearance on German television. Part German-English lyrics).





Modern Love

 

I know when to go out
I know when to stay in
And get things done

I catch the paper boy
But things don't really change
I'm standing in the wind
But I never wave bye-bye

But I try, I try

There's no sign of life
It's just the power to charm
I'm lying in the rain
But I never wave bye-bye

But I try, I try

Never gonna fall for

CHORUS
  Modern love - walks beside me
  Modern love - walks on by
  Modern love - gets me to the church on time
  Church on time - terrifies me
  Church on time - makes me party
  Church on time - puts my trust in God and Man
  God and Man - no confession
  God and Man - no religion
  God and Man - don't believe in modern love

It's not really work
It's just the power to charm
Still standing in the wind
But I never wave bye bye

But I try, I try

Never gonna fall for

CHORUS

  Modern love - walks beside me
  Modern love - walks on by
  Modern love - gets me to the church on time
  Church on time - terrifies me
  Church on time - makes me party
  Church on time - puts my trust in God and Man
  God and Man - no confession
  God and Man - no religion
  God and Man - I don't believe in modern love

  Modern love - walks beside me
  Modern love - walks on by
  Modern love - gets me to the church on time
  Church on time - terrifies me
  Church on time - makes me party
  Church on time - puts my trust in God and Man
  God and Man - no confession
  God and Man - no religion
  God and Man - I don't believe in modern love

Modern love - Modern love (x 12)

Modern love - Modern love, walks beside me
Modern love - Modern love, walks on by
(repeat 3 more times)




Moonage Daydream

 

I'm an alligator, I'm a mama-papa coming for you
I'm the space invader, I'll be a rock 'n' rollin' bitch for you
Keep your mouth shut, you're squawking like a pink monkey bird

Sometimes I feel
The need to move on
So I pack a bag
And move on
Move on

Well I might take a train
Or sail at dawn
Might take a girl
When I move on
When I move on

Somewhere, someone's calling me
When the chips are down
I'm just a travelling man
Maybe it's just a trick of the mind, but
Somewhere there's a morning sky
Bluer than her eyes
Somewhere there's an ocean
Innocent and wild

Africa is sleepy people
Russia has its horsemen
Spent some nights in old Kyoto
Sleeping on the matted ground

Cyprus is my island
When the going's rough
I would love to find you
Somewhere in a place like that

Somewhere, someone's calling me
When the chips are down
I stumble like a blind man
Can't forget you
Can't forget you

Feeling like a shadow
Drifting like a leaf
I stumble like a blind man
Can't forget you
Can't forget you

Can't forget you
Can't forget you

(Recorded during the Lodger sessions at Mountain Studios, Montreux, Switzerland in 1979).





Movin' On

 

(Partial lyrics)

You go out at night from your sixty dollar single down in West Hollywood
With your ripped off clothes that are bulging at the seams
I can't believe that you don't know you look ugly
I mean, are you really all that dumb?
I mean, I don't want you to be that dumb you know
But you are
You're just dumb

Straight out of the cradle and into the hole with you
He begins screaming
When I walk through the door
I'm your new breed of whore
We will now drink to me

(Recorded with Iggy Pop at Oz Studios, Hollywood, USA in May 1975).





Music Is Lethal

(English Lyrics: David Bowie. Music: Lucio Battisti)

My friend, myself
Boredom's hero
Prince of the alleys
Stumble falling to a winsome table in search of wine

Mulatto hookers
Cocaine bookers
Troubled husbands
Stoned on freedoms, that only evening unfolds to shine

Through the twisting inn of screaming pleasure, two wet lips of infant leisure smiled
Could I grasp at the stars?
As they play your night blue hair

Sable eyes, Ebony thighs
She shines forever
Dancer be, dancing free
She shines for me

So a masked man should mourn
The passing of night time
The warped metal dirge
We were prisoners no more
Of the cruel fallen angels
She will shine on for me

Let the panting begin
Though the music is lethal
Let the night take me in
You know the daybreak shall win
She will shine on forever
He will shine on for me

While jeering waiters, grope at your shoulders
I drink your kisses
Exquisite room, my charming tomb
I see the man
With marble hands
Your smooth pimp Piranha
Cradles my swimming head
Cracks his glass, into my face, I'm thrown away

And then I'm tossed a-bleeding out on the street
Ask me John not to drag me away
And I curse where I lay
Then he bowed with thanks some way

Ten thousand engines, skid unwielding
Puncture my skin
Bait and taunt
For me to run, back to my rooms

Though the bad taste of sleep
Clutching my pillow
In anger I weep
She will cry on my chest
She will shine on forever
She will shine on for me

Let the tempting begin
Though the music is lethal
Let the night take me in
You know the daybreak shall win
She will shine on forever
She will shine on for me

Ahhh, yeah
Oh, ohhhhh




My Death

(Jacques Brel. Translation: Mort Schuman/Eric Blau)

My death waits like an old Drouet
So confident I'll go his way
Whistle to him and the passing time
My death waits like a Bible truth
At the funeral of my youth
We drank for that and the passing time
My death waits like a witch at night
As surely as our love is bright
Let's not think about the passing time

CHORUS
  But whatever lies behind the door
  There is nothing much to do
  Angel or devil, I don't care
  For in front of that door, there is you

My death waits like a beggar blind
Who sees the world through an unlit mind
Throw him a dime for the passing time
My death waits there between your thighs
Your cool fingers will close my eyes
Let's not think of that and the passing time
My death waits to allow my friends
A few good times before it ends
So let's drink to that and the passing time

CHORUS

My death waits there among the leaves
In magician's mysterious sleeves
Rabbits and dogs and the passing time
My death waits there among the flowers
Where the blackest shadow, blackest shadow cowers
Let's pick lilacs for the passing time
My death waits there in a double bed
Sails of oblivion at my head
So pull up the sheets against the passing time

CHORUS

(Performed live during various Ziggy Stardust World Tours 1972-1973).





Nathan Adler - Segue 1

(Lyrics: David Bowie. Music: Bowie/Gabrels/Garson/Kizilcay/Campbell)

Old Touchshriek was the main nameserver
Suspected of being a shoulder surfer
But he didn't know from shit
About challenge response systems
Now Ramona A. Stone we know was selling interest drugs
She got males all hung up on her mind filters
She was, if you don't mine me saying so, an update demon
Now Leon
He couldn't wait for 12 o'clock midnight
He jumps up on the stage
With a criss criss machete
And slashes around cutting a zero on everything
I mean a zero in the fabric of time itself
Was this a suspect?
I says to myself
"Woa! Quelle courage!"
Oh wait, I'm getting ahead of myself
Let me take you back to when it all began




Nathan Adler - Segue 2

(Lyrics: David Bowie. Music: Bowie/Gabrels/Garson/Kizilcay/Campbell)

Ramona is so cold
When she broke it off with Leon
She said "The ring is enough, I don't wanna see this face again"
Ramona was so cold
Ramona was so cold




Nature Boy (Version 1)

(eden ahbez)

(Spoken: Ewan McGregor): (This story is about... love. The woman I lo.. loved... is dead).

There was a boy
A very strange enchanted boy
They say he wandered very far, very far
Over land and sea
A little shy and sad of eye
But very wise was he

And then one day
One magic day he passed my way
While we spoke of many things
Fools and kings
This he said to me:
"The greatest thing you'll ever learn
Is just to love and be loved in return"




Nature Boy (Version 2)

(Lyrics: eden ahbez. Music: Massive Attack)

There was a boy
A very strange enchanted boy
They say he wandered very far, very far
Over land and sea
A little shy and sad of eye
But very wise was he

And then one day
One magic day he passed my way
And while we spoke of many things
Fools and kings
This he said to me:
"The greatest thing you'll ever learn
Is just to love and be loved in return"




Needles On The Beach

(David Bowie/Reeves Gabrels/Tony Sales/Hunt Sales)






Neighbourhood Threat

(Lyrics: Iggy Pop. Music: David Bowie/Ricky Gardiner)

Down where your paint is cracking
Look down your backstairs buddy
Somebody's living there and
He don't really feel the weather
And he don't share your pleasures
No he don't share your pleasures
Look at his eyes
Did you see his crazy eyes
You're so surprised he don't run to catch your ash
Everybody always wants to kiss your trash

You can't help him
Nobody can
Now that he knows
There's nothing to get
Will you still place your bet
On the neighborhood threat

Somewhere a baby's bleeding
Somewhere a mother's needing
Outside a boy is lying
But mostly he is crying
And he just shouts in anger
You'll find him interesting
Look at his eyes
Did you see his crazy eyes
You're so surprised he doesn't build for you
Everybody always wants to run with you




Neuköln





(Recorded during the "Heroes" sessions at Hansa Tonstudio, Berlin, Germany in 1977).





Never Let Me Down

(David Bowie/Carlos Alomar)

When I believed in nothing
I called her name
Trapped in a high-dollar joint in some place
I called her name
And though my days were slipping by
And nights so cruel I thought I'd die
She danced her little dance 'till it made me cry
She was shakin' like this honey doing that

When I needed soul revival
I called your name
When I was falling to pieces
I screamed in pain

Her soothing hand that turns me round
A love so real swept over me
You danced your little dance 'till it made me cry
You were shakin' like this honey doing that

Never let me down
She never let me down
Never let me down
She never let me down

When all your faith is failing
Call my name
When you've nothing coming
Call my name

I'll be strong for all it takes
I'll cover your head till the bad stuff breaks
Dance my little dance till it makes you smile
Shaking like this honey doing that

Never let you down
I'll never let you down
I'll never let you down
I'll never let you down
Oh no

(Whistling)

('I'm Tired' was a Carlos Alomar composition that was rewritten by David and became 'Never Let Me Down').





New Angels Of Promise

(David Bowie/Reeves Gabrels)

VERSE 1
  New angels of promise
  We despair
  We are the dead dreams
  We take the blame
  Take us to the edge of time
  Take us to the edge of time
  We are the fabulous lovers
  I am a blind man
  She is my eyes

CHORUS (x2)
  Suspicious minds
  You didn't feel us coming in this lonely crowd
  It's always time

VERSE 2
  New angels of promise
  We despise
  Don't fall apart now
  We are the silent ones

  Take us to the edge of time
  Take us to the edge of time
  We are the tabular lovers
  We listen to the storm

CHORUS (x2)

VERSE 1

CHORUS (x2)

It's always time (repeat)




New York's In Love

 

Yes
Do you see that thing?
I'm sure it's love
Would you do one thing?
New York's in love
The city grew wings in the back of night
The clouds are stuck like candy-floss
She sees the rich trash having all the fun
Makes her wonder where they get their energy from
There's nothing you can do to her
The city's all clean and waiting
I don't mean to wait too long
But this joint can't get much higher

CHORUS
  New York's in love
  With her big green eyes
  And her long blonde hair
  New York's in flames
  New York's in love
  With the way she talks, t-t-talk, t-t-talks
  And the way she walks
  New York's in love
  Goo goo goo goo goo goo

My, oh my, it's a tom-tom beat
No-one knows they've had their day
We can dance and we can see the singles swing
Everybody's waiting for the go-go boys
You've turned to stone by the family
It's how the dead speak to the living
Nothing left here but a raging blaze
And I don't mean to wait too long

CHORUS
  New York's in love
  With her big green eyes
  And her long blonde hair
  New York's in flames
  New York's in love
  With the way she talks
  And the way she walks, walk that walk
  New York's in love
  Goo goo goo goo goo goo

Pretty as a picture

New York, New York
Rent me a missile

New York's in love, New York's in love
New York's in flames

New York's in love
New York, New York




Night Clubbing

(Iggy Pop/David Bowie)

Nightclubbing we're nightclubbing
We're what's happening
Nightclubbing we're nightclubbing
We're an ice machine
We see people brand new people
They're something to see
When we're nightclubbing
Bright-white clubbing
Oh isn't it wild?

Nightclubbing we're nightclubbing
We're walking through town
Nightclubbing we're nightclubbing
We walk like a ghost
We learn dances brand new dances
Like the nuclear bomb
When we're nightclubbing
Bright white clubbing
Oh isn't it wild...




Nite Flights

(Scott Engels)

There's no hold
The moving has come through
The danger passing you
Turns its face into the heat and runs the tunnels
It's so cold
The dark dug up by dogs
The stitches torn and broke
The raw meat fist you choke
Has hit the bloodlite

Glass traps open and close on nite flights
Broken necks feather weights press the walls
Be my love, we will be Gods on nite flights
With only one promise, only one way to fall

Glass traps open and close on nite flights
Broken necks feather weight press the walls
Be my love, we will be Gods on nite flights
With only one promise, only one way to fall

On nite flights
On nite flights
On nite flights
Only one way to fall

On nite flights
On nite flights
On nite flights
Only one way to fall

No Control

(Lyrics: David Bowie. Music: David Bowie/Brian Eno)

Stay away from the future
Back away from the light
It's all deranged
No control

Sit tight in your corner
Don't tell God your plans
It's all deranged
No control

If I could control tomorrow's haze
The darkened shore would not bother me
If I can't control the web we weave
My life will be lost in fallen leaves

Every single move's uncertain
Don't tell God your plans
It's all deranged
No control

I shall live my life on bended knee
If I can't control my destiny
You've gotta have a scheme
You've gotta have a plan
In the world of today, for tomorrow's man

No control

Stay away from the future
Don't tell God your plans
It's all deranged
No control

Forbidden worlds, deafen me
In memory
No control
See how far a sinful man
Burn his tracks, his bloody robes
You've gotta have a scheme
You've gotta have a plan
In the world of today, for tomorrow's man

I shall live my lies on bended knee
If I can't control my destiny
No control
I can't believe I've no control
It's all deranged
I can't believe I've no control
It's all deranged
Deranged
Deranged




No One Calls

(Lyrics: David Bowie. Music: David Bowie/Reeves Gabrels)

Nobody calls
Fall into pieces
Don't be afraid
Life isn't easy

Sunshine to rain
Counting the windows

But nobody calls

Nobody calls

Sunshine to rain
Smile for the camera

But nobody phones
Nobody phones
Anyone
At all

Not at all (x3)

Nobody phones
Anyone
At all     (x4)

Not at all (x2 )




Nothing To Be Desired

(Lyrics: David Bowie. Music: David Bowie/Brian Eno)

(murmuring in background throughout)
Nothing to be desired
It leaves nothing to be desired
Nothing

There's nothing to be desired
Nothing to be desired
Nothing to be desired any more

Mind changing
Mind changing
Mind changing
Change your
  Mind changing
Mind changing
Change your mind changing
Mind changing
  Stand by
Mind changing
Mind changing
  Stand by
Mind changing
Mind changing
And there's nothing to be desired
Nothing to be desired
Nothing
Certainly not ?

Nothing to be desired
Nothing
Nothing to be desired
It's not mind changing
Mind changing
Change your mind changing
Mind changing
Change your mind changing
Mind changing
Change your mind changing
Mind changing
Change your mind changing

Mind change

Aaha

O Superman

(Laurie Anderson)

O Superman. O judge. O Mom and Dad. Mom and Dad
O Superman. O judge. O Mom and Dad. Mom and Dad

Hi. I'm not home right now
But if you want to leave a message
Just start talking at the sound of the tone

Hello? This is your Mother
Are you there? Are you coming home?
Hello? Is anybody home?

Well, you don't know me, but I know you.
And I've got a message to give to you.
Here come the planes.
So you better get ready.
Ready to go.
You can come as you are, but pay as you go
Pay as you go

And I said:
  OK. Who is this really?
And the voice said:
  This is the hand, the hand that takes
  This is the hand, the hand that takes
  This is the hand, the hand that takes

Here come the planes
They're American planes
Made in America
Smoking or non-smoking?

And the voice said:
  Neither snow nor rain nor gloom of night shall
  stay these couriers from the swift completion
  of their appointed rounds
  'Cos when love is gone, there's always justice
  And when justice is gone, there's always force
  And when force is gone, there's always Mom

Hi Mom!
So hold me, Mom, in your long arms
So hold me, Mom, in your long arms
In your automatic arms
Your electronic arms
In your arms
So hold me, Mom, in your long arms
Your petrochemical arms
Your military arms
In your electronic arms

(Performed live during the Earthling World Tour 1997. Lead vocals by Gail Ann Dorsey).





Oh! Darling

 

(See Don't Be Afraid)





Oh! You Pretty Things

 

Wake up you sleepy head
Put on some clothes, shake up your bed
Put another log on the fire for me
I've made some breakfast and coffee
Look out my window what do I see?
Crack in the sky and a hand reaching down to me
All the nightmares came today
And it looks as though they're here to stay

What are we coming to?
No room for me, no fun for you
I think about a world to come
Where the books were found by the Golden Ones
Written in pain, written in awe
By a puzzled man who questioned
What we were here for
All the strangers came today
And it looks as though they're here to stay

Oh! You pretty things
Don't you know you're driving your Mama's and Papa's insane
Oh! You pretty things
Don't you know you're driving your Mama's and Papa's insane
Let me make it plain
You gotta make way for the Homo Superior

Look out at your children
See their faces in golden rays
Don't kid yourself they belong to you
They're the start of the coming race
The Earth is a bitch
We've finished our news
Homo Sapiens have outgrown their use
All the strangers came today
And it looks as though they're here to stay

Oh! You pretty things
Don't you know you're driving your Mama's and Papa's insane
Oh! You pretty things
Don't you know you're driving your Mama's and Papa's insane
Let me make it plain
Gotta make way for the Homo Superior




One Shot - (Original Version)

(David Bowie/Reeves Gabrels/Tony Sales/Hunt Sales)

Ooo-oo-oo-oh, oo-oo-oo-oh
Ooo-oo-oo-oh, oo-oo-ooo

Last days were the meanest
Leanest days of our lives
You threw me the pieces
I started the fires
One thing led to a dead end
One shot put her away, hey-hey

Look out on a green world
Windows and wives
No bedroom to run to
No miracle jive - no conversation

Then nothing meant nothing
Ten dollars tore us apart
One thing led to a dead end
One shot put her away, hey-hey

One day nothing meant nothing
Ten dollars tore us apart
One thing led to a dead end
And one shot put her away, hey-hey

Look out on a green world
Windows and wives
No bedroom to run to
No woman alive

Hot love is the dearest
No money can buy
She burnt like a Spitfire
One shot put her away, hey-hey

One shot put her away
One shot put her away, hey-hey yeah
One shot put her away
Uh-huh-huh, uh-huh-huh
Uh-huh-huh, uh-huh-huh
Uh-huh-huh, uh-huh-huh


(This original version was intended for the final album master. At the last minute the band decided to go back into the studio and re-record the song in a different key and with various arrangement tweaks).

Opening Titles Including Underground

(Lyrics: David Bowie. Music David Bowie/Trevor Jones)

It's only forever
Not long at all
The lost and lonely

No one can blame you
For walking away
Too much rejection, nah nah
No love injection, nah nah
Life can be easy
It's not always swell
Don't tell me truth hurts, little girl
'Cos it hurts like hell (echo hurts like hell)

But down in the underground
You'll find someone true
Down in the underground
A land serene
A crystal moon, ah, ah

It's only forever
It's not long at all
Lost and lonely
That's underground
Underground

The mental and diva's hands
The fisting of life

It's happening, now
Not tomorrow

Over The Wall We Go - (version 1)

 

Over the wall we go
All coppers are 'nanas
Over the wall we go
Leave 'em a note saying "Wish you was here"
I know the best ways to break out of here
I helped a young laddie called Ivan
Over the wall last night
Then he climbed back and he grabbed me tight
He uttered some words that I can't say to you
'Cos he remembered that he was a screw

Over the wall we go
All coppers are 'nanas
Over the wall we go
Leave 'em a note wishing "Happy New Year"

My name is Henry, some say I'm thick
I've spent half me life in and out of nick
Me mum sends me presents to keep me in style
Soggy old cakes and hundreds of files
God sussed all them files, I'm a clever young man
Now I'm just stupid with manicured hands

Over the wall we go
All coppers are 'nanas
Over the wall we go
Nobody's left and the screws are in tears

(spoken):
  "Double 3 427"  "Here Sir"
  "Double 3 428"  "Here Sir"
  "Double 3 429, Double 3 429, where is he?"
  "He went out for a cup of tea at the local football match Sir"
  "Oh... well he might have invited me"

Over the wall we go
All coppers are 'nanas
Over the wall we go
Nobody's left and the screws are in tears

We tried digging tunnels but gave up the ghost
Just past the Kensington Yards at the most
Our limbs was aching, we felt pretty pooped
Our clothes they was tatty, our hallows did droop
We crawled back to safety, our hearts filled with gloom
'Cos we'd dug ourselves through to the smallest room

Over the wall we go
All coppers are 'nanas
Over the wall we go
Leave 'em a note wishing "Happy New Year"

spoken
  (knock knock knock)
  "Hello, who is it?"
  "Double 3 429, guv"
  "Oh, hang on a minute...
   Hello sonny Jim
   Been wondering where you were
   Did you have a nice Christmas?"




Over The Wall We Go - (version 2)

 

Over the wall we go
All coppers are 'nanas
Over the wall we go

I know all the best ways to break out of here
I helped a young laddie called Ivan
I bundled him over the wall last night
Then he climbed back and he grabbed me tight
He uttered some words that I can't say to you
'Cos he remembered that he was a screw

Over the wall we go
All coppers are 'nanas
Over the wall we go
Leave 'em a note saying "Happy New Year"

  "Double 3 424" "Hello"
  "Double 3 425" "Hi"
  "Double 3 426, Double 3 426, where is he?"
  "Here, keep it up the ledge another course and we're out"

Over the wall we go
All coppers are 'nanas
Over the wall we go
Leave 'em a note saying "Happy New Year"

My name is Reggie the scandalous mind
I got seven years so I gossip my time
I gave all the tickbits and pieces of newt
I'm a privileged corpse and my uniform is blue
The new lads would ask me if I am a screw
I'll tell them "Oh cheeky not even for you"

Over the wall we go
All coppers are 'nanas
Over the wall we go
Leave 'em a note saying "Happy New Year"

Over the wall we go
All coppers are 'nanas
Over the wall we go
Leave 'em a note saying "Happy New Year"

Over the wall we go
All coppers are 'nanas
Over the wall we go
Leave 'em a note saying "Happy New Year"




Pallas Athena

 

God is on top of it all
And that's all it is

Athena, Athena, Athena, Athena




Pancho

(Lyrics: David Bowie. Music: Willy Albimoor/Andree Cylene Giroud)

Pancho, the world is afraid of
Pancho, and no one speaks to
Pancho, rides his motorbike
Pancho, never shirking
Pancho, always fighting
Pancho, speeding down the highways and the byways
With the police on his tail
No one understands him
But for one girl and that's me

Pancho, I call you chou chou
Pancho, 'cos when he's with me
Pancho is a loving Pancho guy
Pancho, when you kiss me
Pancho, what can this mean?
Pancho, is this really you?

Pancho (x 3)

Eyes cold and determined
Like a knife flash in the dark
Pancho, my wicked Pancho
My darling Pancho, you stole my heart
Pancho, which disguises
Pancho, the loving kiss or
Pancho is it in those eyes?

Pancho, the world is afraid of
Pancho and no one talked to
Pancho, a face lit from inside

Pancho (x 3)




Panic In Detroit

 

Ow!
  (Bah oooooo, oooooo)

He looked a lot like Che Guevara, drove a diesel van
Kept his gun in quiet seclusion, such a humble man
The only survivor of The National People's Gang
Panic in Detroit, asked for an autograph
He wanted to stay home, I wish someone would phone
Panic in Detroit

He laughed at accidental sirens that broke the evening gloom
The police had warned of repercussions
They followed none too soon
A trickle of strangers were all that were left alive
Panic in Detroit, I asked for an autograph
He wanted to stay home, I wish someone would phone
Panic in Detroit

Putting on some clothes I made my way to school
And I found my teacher crouching in his overall
I screamed and ran to smash my favourite slot machine
And jumped the silent cars that slept the traffic lights

Having scored a trillion dollars, made a run back home
Found him slumped across the table, a gun and me alone
I ran to the window, looked for a plane or two
Panic in Detroit.  He'd left me an autograph
"Let me collect dust" I wish someone would phone
Panic in Detroit (x3)
Ow!




Panic In Detroit - (re-recorded version)

 

He looked a lot like Che Guevara, drove a diesel van
He kept his gun in quiet seclusion, such a humble man
The only survivor of the National People's Gang
Panic in Detroit, I asked for an autograph
He wanted to stay home, I wish someone would phone
Panic in Detroit

He laughed at accidental sirens that broke the evening gloom
The police had warned of repercussions
They followed none too soon
A trickle of strangers were all that were left alive
Panic in Detroit, I asked for an autograph
He wanted to stay home, I wish someone would phone
Panic in Detroit

Putting on some clothes I made my way to school
Found my teacher crouching in his overalls
I screamed and ran to smash my favourite slot machine
And I jumped the silent cars that slept at traffic lights

(Spoken):
  "That is correct
  Now spell Detroit
  You are incorrect
  Panic is spelt P-A-N-I-C
  P-A-N-I-C
  I-C"

Having scored a trillion dollars, I made the run back home
Found him slumped across the table, a gun and me alone
I ran to the window and looked for a plane or two
Panic in Detroit.  He'd left me an autograph
"Let me collect dust." I wish someone would phone
Panic in Detroit
Panic in Detroit
Panic in
Ooo-ooo-ooo (repeat and fade)

Perfect Day

(Lou Reed)

Just a perfect day
Drink Sangria in the park
And then later
When it gets dark
We go home

Just a perfect day
Feed animals in the zoo
Then later, a movie, too
And then home

CHORUS
  Oh it's such a perfect day
  I'm glad I spent it with you
  Oh! such a perfect day
  You just keep me hanging on
  You just keep me hanging on

Just a perfect day
Problems all left alone
Weekenders on our own
It's such fun

Just a perfect day
You made me forget myself
I thought I was someone else
Someone good

CHORUS

You're going to reap just what you sow (x4)

Oh! What a perfect day




Planet Of Dreams

(David Bowie/Gail Ann Dorsey)

Nothing on smoke today
Nothing dies on the wing
Wing's been losing time
And then I keep all the pain
Pain that comes and goes
It goes against all you see
You see I got Gable's eyes
And Eisenhower blames the poor
The poor huddled on the curb
Gotta get back in shape

We're backing up a major plan
We're treading on thin, thin ice
We're walking under golden sun
We're living in a Planet of Dreams
We're living in a Planet of Dreams
We're living in a Planet of Dreams
We're living in a Planet of Dreams
We're living in a Planet of Dreams
We're living in a Planet
(5 more times)

Do do do do (repeat ad inf.)




Play It Safe

(Iggy Pop/David Bowie)

Say Ta
Eisenhower saw the thing
Oh
Oh
He said this is sickening
Oh
I swear I saw the very thing
Oh
I saw it in America

Let's play safe
I never knew how
How to play safe
You told me how
How to play safe
A thousand times

I don't believe in fairies any more

Today I saw a very very thing
But that's another song
You're too simple minded
Let's play it safe

What do we have in common?
(It was a real thing)
Play it safe

What do we have in common?
Play it safe
I'll tell you something safe

I want to be a criminal
Play it safe
Oh I wanna be a criminal

I want to be a criminal
Play it safe
Well it's that real thing inside a criminal mind

What do we have in common?
Play it safe
That keeps me goin' all the time

What do we have in common?
Play it safe
That very very thing I find so sublime

I want to be a criminal
Play it safe
And I wanna know

I wanna know

I want to be a criminal
Play it safe
And I wanna know

I wanna know
I wanna know

What do we have in common?
Play it safe
Rockin' and reelin' like Al Capone

What do we have in common?
(Slippin' and slidin' like Joey Gallo)
And I wanna know

I wanna be a criminal
(Movin' and groovin' with a Son of Sam)
Play it safe

I wanna be a criminal
(Splish splash I was Jim Jones)
Play it safe




Pretty Pink Rose

 

Yeah, she's just been to Russia and they're dyeing their faces
They're dying over there
A pretty pink rose
(That rock 'n' roll lady takes a space-ship ride
She's out of this world
A pretty pink rose)

And we're living for you, my love
We're living for you
And we're dying for you, my love
Pretty pink rose

She tore down Paris on the tail of Thom Paine
But the left wing's broken, the right's insane
A pretty pink rose
(Ah, have a nice day, it's a killer, turn a cheek
It's a Christian code
A pretty pink rose)

And we're living for you, my love
Yes we're living for you
And we're dying for you, my love
Pretty pink rose

Ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh

She's the poor man's gold, she's the anarchist crucible
Flying in the face of the despot cannibal
Pretty pink rose
Never let it rain, never rain
On the heart of the pretty pink rose
Pretty pink rose

And we're living for you, my love
We're living for you
And we're dying for you, my love
Pretty pink rose

Ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh

Get me through the pain, through the pain
Of the thorn of the pretty pink rose
Never let it rain, never rain, never rain
On the pretty pink rose

(Take me to the heart, to the heart, to the heart
Of the pretty pink rose)
Never let it rain, never rain, never rain
(Take me to the heart, to the heart, to the heart)

Never never let it rain, never rain
(Take me to the heart, to the heart, to the heart
Of the pretty pink rose)
Never let it rain on the heart of the
(Take me to the heart, to the heart, to the heart)
Never let, never let it rain, never rain on the heart

(Take me to the heart, to the heart, to the heart
Of the pretty pink rose)
(Take me to the heart, to the heart, to the heart)
Never let it rain, never let it rain, never rain

(Take me to the heart, to the heart, to the heart)




Queen Bitch

 

Do-pe-to-cu-cum-ba-ba-ba-da-dah
Ahh yeah
Oh yeah

I'm up on the eleventh floor
And I'm watching the cruisers below
He's down on the street
And he's trying hard to pull sister Flo
Oh, my heart's in the basement
My weekend's at an all time low
'Cos she's hoping to score
So I can't see her letting him go
Walk out of her heart
Walk out of her mind
Oh loved her

She's so swishy in her satin and tat
In her frock coat and bipperty-bopperty hat
Oh God, I could do better than that
Oh yeah

She's an old-time ambassador
Of sweet talking, night walking games
Oh and she's known in the darkest clubs
For pushing ahead of the dames
If she says she can do it
Then she can do it, she don't make false claims

But she's a Queen, and such are Queens
That your laughter is sucked in their brains
Now she's leading him on
And she'll lay him right down
Yeah she's leading him on
And she'll lay him right down
But it could have been me
Yes, it could have been me
Why didn't I say, why didn't I say, no, no, no

She's so swishy in her satin and tat
In her frock coat and bipperty-bopperty hat
Oh God, I could do better than that

So I lay down a while
And I gaze at my hotel wall
Oh the cot is so cold
It don't feel like no bed at all
Yeah I lay down a while
And I look at my hotel wall
And he's down on the street
So I throw both his bags down the hall
And I'm phoning a cab
'Cos my stomach feels small
There's a taste in my mouth
And it's no taste at all
It could have been me
Oh yeah, it could have been me
Why didn't I say, why didn't I say, no, no, no

She's so swishy in her satin and tat
In her frock coat and bipperty-bopperty hat
Oh God, I could do better than that
Ohh, you betcha - oh yeah - uh-hu - mmm




Quicksand

 

I'm closer to the Golden Dawn
Immersed in Crowley's uniform
Of imagery
I'm living in a silent film
Portraying Himmler's sacred realm
Of dream reality
I'm frightened by the total goal
Drawing to the ragged hole
And I ain't got the power anymore
No I ain't got the power anymore

I'm the twisted name on Garbo's eyes
Living proof of Churchill's lies
I'm destiny
I'm torn between the light and dark
Where others see their target
Divine symmetry
Should I kiss the Viper's fang
Or herald loud the death of Man?
I'm sinking in the quicksand of my thought
And I ain't got the power anymore

Don't believe in yourself
Don't deceive with belief
Knowledge comes with death's release

I'm not a prophet or a stone age man
Just a mortal with potential of a superman
I'm living on
I'm tethered to the logic of Homo Sapien
Can't take my eyes from the great salvation of bullshit faith
If I don't explain what you ought to know
You can tell me all about it on the next Bardo
I'm sinking in the quicksand of my thought
And I ain't got the power anymore

Don't believe in yourself
Don't deceive with belief
Knowledge comes with death's release

Don't believe in yourself
Don't deceive with belief
Knowledge comes with death's release




Ramona A. Stone

(Lyrics: David Bowie. Music: Bowie/Eno/Gabrels/Garson/Kizilcay/Campbell)

I was Ramona A. Stone
I started with no enemies of my own
I was an artiste
In a tunnel
But I've been having a midi-life crisis
And I've been dreaming of sleep
And ape men with metal parts
I've spat upon deeply felt age
I've hid my hearts in
And I hate the funny coloured English
We'll creep together you and I
For I know who the small friends are




Ragazzo Solo, Ragazza Sola

(Lyrics: Ivan Mogul. Music: David Bowie)

(Lonely Boy, Lonely Girl - Italian Space Oddity)

La mia mente ha presol il volo
Un pensiero uno solo
Io cammino mentre dorme la citta'

I suoi occhi nella notte
Fanali bianchi nella notte
Una voce che mi parla chi sara'?

Dimmi ragazzo solo dove vai
Perche' tanto dolore?
Hai perduto senza dubbio un grande amore
Ma di amori e' tutta piena la citta'

No ragazza sola, no no no
Stavolta sei in errore
Non ho perso solamente un grande amore
Ieri sera ho perso tutto con lei

Ma lei
I colori della vita
Dei cieli blu
Una come lei non la trovero' mai piu'

Ora ragazzo solo dove andrai
La notte e' un grande mare
Se ti serve la mia mano per nuotare
Grazie ma stasera io vorrei morire
Perche' sai negli occhi miei
C'e' un angelo, un angelo
Che ormai non vola piu' che ormai non vola piu'
Che ormai non vola piu'
C'e' lei
I colori della vita
Dei cieli blu
Una come lei non la trovero' mai piu'




Real Cool World

 

So far this love is delightful
The face of seduction was you
But I listened for each and every footstep
In this Real Cool World

Questioning saint-like and fantastic heroes
Feeling like lost little children in fabled lands
So I listen for each and every friendship
In this Real Cool World

Now there is you
In my Real Cool World

Starry-eyed life but somehow believing in nothing
You whisper sweet nothing but reading between your lines
I listen, colour me doubtful
In this Real Cool World

Now there is you
In my Real Cool World
Mmm
Now there is you
In my Real Cool World

You came from nowhere
You came from nowhere
You held me you shook me away

It's a Cool World
It's a Cool World

It's a Real Cool World
It's a Real Cool World
It's a Real Cool World
It's a Real Cool World

Now there is you
In my Real Cool World

Now there is you
In my Real Cool World

Now there is you
In my Real Cool World

Real Cool World

Eh, eh

Red Money

(Lyrics: David Bowie. Music: David Bowie/Carlos Alomar)

Oh, can you feel it in the way
That a man is not a man?
Can you see it in the sky
That the landscape is too high?

Like a nervous disease
And it's been there all along
It will tumble from the sky
It's been there all along

  Can you hear it fall
  Can you hear it well
  Can you hear it at all

I was really feeling good
Reet Petite and how d'ya do
Then I got the small red box
And I didn't know what to do
'Cos my fingers could not grope
And I could not give it away
And I knew I must not drop it
Stop it, take it away

Red Sails

(Lyrics: David Bowie. Music: David Bowie/Brian Eno)

Feel a bit roughed up, feel a bit frightened
Nearly pin it down some time
Red sail action wake up in the wrong town
Boy, I really get around

Thunder ocean
Thunder ocean
Red sails take me, make me sail along

Red sails, and a mast so tall
Red sails
Red sails

Do you remember we another person
Green and black and red and so scared
Graffiti on the wall kept us all in tune
Bringing us all back home

Red sails
Thunder ocean
Red sails
Sailor can't dance like you, ooh, yooou

Ahh, red sail
Red sail action
Red sail
Some reaction

Action boy seen living under neon
Struggle with a foreign tongue
Red sails make him strong
Action make him sail along
Life stands still and stares

The hinterland, the hinterland
We're gonna sail to the hinterland
And it's far far, far far far, far far far away
Its a far far, far far far, fa da, da da da

Remembering Marie A.

(Bertolt Brecht. Translation: Dominic Muldowney)

It was a day in that blue month September
Silent beneath the plum trees' slender shade
I held her there
My love, so pale and silent
As if she were a dream that must not fade

Above us in the shining summer heaven
There was a cloud my eyes dwelled long upon
It was quite white and very high above us
Then I looked up
And found that it had gone

And since that day, so many moons in silence
Have swum across the sky and gone below
The plum trees surely have been chopped for firewood
And if you ask, how does that love seem now
I must admit, I really can't remember
And yet I know what you are trying to say
But what her face was like, I know no longer
I only know I kissed it on that day

As for the kiss, I long ago forgot it
But for the cloud that floated in the sky
I know that still and shall forever know it
It was quite white and moved in very high
It may be that the plum trees still are blooming
That woman's seventh child may now be there
And yet that cloud had only bloomed for minutes
When I looked up
It vanished on the air

(Recorded for 1982 BBC TV production of Baal).





Repetition

 

Johnny is a man
And he's bigger than you
But his overheads are high
And he looks straight through when you ask him how the kids are

He'll get home around seven
'Cos the Chevy's real old
And he could have had a Cadillac
If the school had taught him right
And he could have married Anne with the blue silk blouse
He could have married Anne with the blue silk blouse

And the food is on the table
But the food is cold
Don't hit her

"Can't you even cook?
What's the good of me working when you can't damn cook?"

Well Johnny is a man
And he's bigger than her
I guess the bruises won't show
If she wears long sleeves
But the space in her eyes shows through

And he could have married Anne with the blue silk blouse
He could have married Anne with the blue silk blouse
Shows through
Shows through
Shows through

(Recorded during the Lodger sessions at Mountain Studios, Montreux, Switzerland in 1979).





Reptile

(Trent Reznor)

She spread her legs wide open to let the insects in
She leaves a trail of honey to show me where she's been
She has the blood of reptile just underneath her skin
Seeds from a thousand others drip down from within

Oh my beautiful liar
Oh my precious whore
My disease my infection
I am so impure

Devils speak of the way in which she'll manifest
Angels bleed from the tainted touch of my caress
Need to contaminate to alleviate this loneliness
I know now the depths I'll reach are limitless

Oh my beautiful liar
Oh my precious whore
My disease my infection
I am so impure

(Performed live with Nine Inch Nails during the Outside World Tour 1995 in the USA).





Revolutionary Song

(David Bowie/Jack Fishman)

When people call us revolutionary
They're just trying to see
All that we choose

When all we want is everybody free
The universe would be one brotherhood

It isn't wrong to be prepared to fight
Together to unite if we believe
In giving everything our heart and soul
Until we reach the goal we should achieve

It shouldn't matter if we're brown or white
Yellow or black as night to anyone
We're all born equal with the self same rights
Sharing the same daylight under the sun

If loving freedom makes me qualify
Of opportunity is where revolutionary
Constantly, fervently, firmly
Revolutionary




Ricochet

 

Like weeds on a rockface waiting for the scythe
Ricochet - ricochet
The world is on a corner waiting for jobs
Ricochet - ricochet
Turn the holy pictures so they face the wall
And who can bear to be forgotten?
And who can bear to be forgotten?

March of flowers, march of dimes
These are the prisons, these are the crimes
Men wait for news while thousands are still asleep
Dreaming of tramlines, factories, pieces of machinery
Mineshafts things like that
March of flowers, march of dimes
These are the prisons, these are the crimes
Sound of thunder, sound of gold
Sound of the Devil breaking parole
Ricochet - it's not the end of the world

Sound of thunder, sound of gold
Sound of the Devil breaking parole
Ricochet - ricochet
These are the prisons, these are the crimes
Teaching life in a violent new way
Ricochet - ricochet
Turn the holy pictures so they face the wall
And who can bear to be forgotten?
And who can bear to be forgotten?

March of flowers, march of dimes
These are the prisons, these are the crimes (crimes)
Early, before the sun, they struggle off to the gates
In their secret fearful places they see their lives
Unravelling before them

March of flowers - march of dimes
These are the prisons, these are the crimes
Sound of thunder, sound of gold
Sound of the Devil breaking parole
Ricochet - it's not the end of the world

But when they get home, damp eyed and weary
They smile and crush their children to their heaving chests
Making unfulfillable promises
For who can bear to be forgotten?

Rock 'N' Roll Star - (1971 demo)

 

If someone had the sense to hear me
If someone had the time to see (yeah)
I could tell them who they are
About the rock 'n' roll stars

Someone has to build the buildings
Someone has to pull them down (yeah)
I could make it all worthwhile as a rock 'n' roll star

So inviting
It's so exciting
To play the part
I could make a big time noise as a rock 'n' star

I could do with that money
I'm so far down with things as they are
I'll send my photograph to my honey
And come on like a regular superstar

I could take your big time noise as a rock 'n' star

Try to get it on with the nation
Maybe I could change the world?
I could tell them I tried
I could make a transformation as a rock 'n' roll star

So inviting
It's so exciting
To play the part
I could make a big time noise as a rock 'n' star

I could do with that money
I'm so far down with things as they are
I'll send my photograph to my honey
And I'd come on like a regular superstar

I could fall asleep at night
As a rock 'n' roll (rock 'n' roll)
Rock 'n' roll (rock 'n' roll) star

I could fall in love all right
Like a rock 'n' roll (rock 'n' roll)
Rock 'n' roll (rock 'n' roll) star

(Demo recorded by Bowie at Radio Luxembourg Studios, 38 Hertford Street, London W1. Given to Les Payne, lead singer of the Chameleons, who recorded their unreleased version on 27th May 1971. Later recorded and renamed 'Star' by Bowie on 8th-11th November 1971 at Trident Studios, Soho, London for The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and The Spiders From Mars album).





Rock 'N' Roll Suicide

 

Time takes a cigarette, puts it in your mouth
You pull on your finger, then another finger, then your cigarette
The water-wall is calling, it lingers, then you forget
Ohhh, you're a rock 'n' roll suicide

You're too old to lose it, too young to choose it
And the clock waits so patiently on your song
You walk past a cafe but you don't eat when you've lived too long
Oh, no, no, no,  you're a rock 'n' roll suicide

Chev brakes are snarling as you stumble across the road
But the day breaks instead so you hurry home
Don't let the sun blast your shadow
Don't let the milk float ride your mind
They're so natural - religiously unkind

Oh no love! you're not alone
You're watching yourself, but you're too unfair
You got your head all tangled up, but if I could only make you care
Oh no love! You're not alone
No matter what or who you've been
No matter when or where you've seen
All the knives seem to lacerate your brain
I've had my share, I'll help you with the pain
You're not alone

Just turn on with me and you're not alone
Let's turn on with me and you're not alone
Let's turn on and be not alone
Gimme your hands 'cos you're wonderful
Gimme your hands 'cos you're wonderful
Oh gimme your hands




Rock 'N Roll With Me

(Lyrics: David Bowie. Music: David Bowie/Geoff MacCormack)

You always were the one that knew
They sold us for the likes of you
I always wanted new surroundings
A room to rent while the lizards lay crying in the heat
Trying to remember who to meet
I would take a foxy kind of stand
While tens of thousands found me in demand

When you rock 'n roll with me
No one else I'd rather be
Nobody here can do it for me
I'm in tears again
When you rock 'n roll with me

Gentle hearts are counted down
The queue is out of sight and out of sounds
Me, I'm out of breath, but not quite doubting
I've found a door which lets me out!

When you rock 'n roll with me
No one else I'd rather be
Nobody down here can do it for me
I'm in tears again
When you rock 'n roll with me

Oooo-oo-oo-oo

Oh, when you rock 'n roll with me
There's no one else I'd rather be, oh
Nobody down here can do it for me
When you rock 'n roll with me

When you rock 'n roll, rock 'n roll with me
No one else I'd rather, I'd rather be
Nobody down here can do it for me
I'm in tears, I'm in tears
When you rock 'n roll with me

Rosalyn

(Jimmy Duncan/Bill Farley)

Hey Rosalyn, tell me where you've been
Hey Rosalyn, tell me where you've been
All the night and all the day
Hide and seek's the game you play
Treating me as sure as sin

Oh Rosalyn, yeah Rosalyn

VERSE
  Hey Rosalyn, you're the girl for me
  Hey Rosalyn, you're the girl for me
  When I'm holding you so tight
  It's so hard to say goodnight

Round And Round

(Chuck Berry)

Well, the joint was rocking
CHORUS
  Going round 'n' round
  Yeah, reeling and a-rocking
  What a crazy sound
  Well, they never stopped rocking
  'Til the moon went down

Well it sounded so sweet
I had to take me a chance
I rose out of my seat
And had to dance
I started moving my feet
And clapping my hands

Yeah, we kept on rocking

CHORUS

About twelve o'clock
When the place was packed
The front doors were locked
I said the place was packed
When the police knocked
Those doors flew back

But kept on rocking

CHORUS

Yeah

About twelve o'clock
Around lock up time
Well, the doors were locked
Said the place was packed
When  the police knocked
Those doors flew back

But it kept on rocking

CHORUS

Yeah, it kept on rocking

Rubber Band

 

Rubber Band
There's a rubber band that plays tunes out of tune
In the Library Garden, Sunday afternoon
While a little chappie waves a golden wand

Rubber Band
In 1910 I was so handsome and so strong
My moustache was stiffly waxed and one foot long
And I loved a girl while you played tea-time tunes

Dear Rubber Band, you're playing my tune out of tune, oh

Rubber Band
Won't you play a haunting theme again to me?
While I eat my scones and drink my cup of tea
The sun is warm but it's a lonely afternoon

Oh, play that theme

Rubber Band
How I wish that I could join your Rubber Band
We could play in Library Parks throughout the land
And one Sunday afternoon, I'd find my love

Rubber Band
In the '14-'18 war I went to sea
Thought my Sunday love was waiting home for me
And now she's married to the leader of your band, oh

(spoken)
Oh yeah... I hope you break your baton

Run

(David Bowie/Kevin Armstrong)

Wish I were a sailor
Crossing an azure sea
Under leaden skies
Under your eyes

But I can't see too far
With these animal eyes
Can't hold my breath
Without your voice

An' I'm danger-prone
I'll be bound
I'll be fast as hell
Without your touch

An' I'll run run run run run
An' I'll run run run run run
Without your love

I'm a goldman
I'm a soaring tower
And it's cold in here
Without your love

Trouble in here - trouble out there
Mainline problems til you no longer care
Get a long-low life - it's duty bound
No hope - no life - no you - ah ha

And I run run run
Run run run
Without your love

I duck the shots - tilt the world
I talk myself crazy - shoot the breeze
Shout to live - shoot to kill
Double up in pain - I'm on my knees




Running Gun Blues

 

I count the corpses on my left, I find I'm not so tidy
So I better get away, better make it today
I've cut twenty-three down since Friday
But I can't control it, my face is drawn
My instinct still emotes it

I slash them cold, I kill them dead
I broke the gooks, I cracked their heads
I'll bomb them out from under the beds
But now I've got the running gun blues

It seems the peacefuls stopped the war
Left Generals squashed and stifled
But I'll slip out again tonight
'Cause they haven't taken back my rifle
For I promote oblivion
And I'll plug a few civilians

I'll slash them cold, I'll kill them dead
I'll break them gooks, I'll crack their heads
I'll slice them till they're running red
But now I've got the running gun blues




Rupert The Riley

 

Who'll ride in my Rupert the Riley?
Ride on for mile after miley
I'm the greatest driver, sit by my side
I'll drive you so wild, if you sit by my side
See how far we travel take hold the wheel
She'll drive us to hell
If you take hold the wheel
Wo-wo-wo-woo, yea-yea-yea-yeah
Toot beep-beep, beep beep
Toot beep-beep, beep beep

Who'll ride in my Rupert the Riley?
Ride on for mile after miley

Tiger tiger brightly Riley of mine
She's shaky on her legs, take that Riley of mine
I'm the greatest driver, sit by my side
I'll drive you so wild, if you sit by my side

Toot beep-beep, beep beep
Toot beep-beep, beep beep

(repeat 4 times)
Who'll ride in my Rupert the Riley?
Ride on for mile after miley




Sabotage

(??)




(Performed live during 'The First Concert Of The Eighties' with Steve Reich and Philip Glass at Carnegie Hall, New York, USA in March 1979. David played viola).





Sacrifice Yourself

(David Bowie/Tony Sales/Hunt Sales)

Some days he feels so empty
Just a talking head
Married to a Klingon
Who could cream him in the press

God could detonate him
God's the one we pick to curse us
Twenty-five years pass him
Like an evening at the circus

CHORUS
  Don't sacrifice yourself
  Don't sacrifice yourself
  Surprise yourself
  Don't sacrifice yourself
  Don't sacrifice yourself
  Don't sacrifice yourself

There it is, the look, the winner you once talked of being
Give her one last kiss and
Dive right out the window screaming
No truth decent, it was Summer from the waist down
She blew the shoes right off your feet
And tells you she's God's Grammy

CHORUS

Her, the only game in town, a queen of confidence
Blind in front of mirrors, proving nothings says a lot
Wham bam thank you Charlie
Vanity is all
You wander lonely to the scene
A crawling up the walls
Don't sacrifice yourself




(Safe In This) Skylife

(Recorded for The Rugrats movie soundtrack but not used. Rewritten and re-recorded as 'Safe' for Heathen album. Released as bonus track on CD single Everyone Says Hi).





Safe

(Lyrics: David Bowie. Music: David Bowie and Reeves Gabrels)

Frozen to the glass again
Out of our skins again
Cold I am
Tonight I am
Tomorrow's really on my mind

Sure to pick up from now on
The things will move more slowly
But thin is thin and chances slim
And sometimes we all have those dreams

Safe in this skylife
Safe, whoa whoa whoa whoa, whoa whoa
Safe in this skylife
Safe, whoa whoa whoa whoa, whoa whoa
In this skylife

The past it almost shimmers now
All we needed
All we wished for
But here I am
And safe am I
Trusting in the endless sky

Safe in this skylife
Safe, whoa whoa whoa whoa, whoa whoa
Safe in this skylife
Safe, whoa whoa whoa whoa, whoa whoa
In this skylife
Skylife
Skylife
Skylife

Are things getting better now?
Are things getting worse?
But I'm standing in the sunshine
And it lifts my heart and feeds my mind

Safe in this skylife
Safe, whoa whoa whoa whoa, whoa whoa
Safe in this skylife
Safe, whoa whoa whoa whoa, whoa whoa
In this skylife
Skylife
Skylife
Skylife
Skylife
Skylife
Skylife




Saviour

(Lyrics: Kristeen Young)

(Kristeen Young)
Baby come inside
Take off your coat
You're just a big fat mess
You're just an American landfill, landfill

 
Can you leave it all behind?
Can you get to what you feel?
Do you need the jaws of life
To cut through the American landfill, landfill?

(Both)
We could rise up from this grave
  You could be my saviour
We could prepare to ascend
  You could be my saviour
We could walk on water
  You could be my saviour
You could be my saviour, saviour

 
Can you just not wear that dress?
Can you just not get your hair cut like that?
Who picks out your clothes?
Sort through the American landfill, landfill

(Both)
We could rise up from this grave
  You could be my saviour
We could prepare to ascend
  You could be my saviour
We could walk on water
  You could be my saviour
I would be your saviour, saviour

We could rise up from this grave
  You could be my saviour
We could prepare to ascend
  You could be my saviour
We could walk on water
  You could be my saviour
Be my reciprocal saviour

(Kristeen Young)
Are you having trouble breathing?
Did you find it hard to breathe?
Did you wake up to find you're buried, semi-alive?
Ah!!! Do you need a hand to dig the American landfill, landfill?


(Appears on the Kristeen Young album 'Breasticles' released on N_Records in Lisbon, Portugal. Produced by Tony Visconti).





Saviour Machine

 

President Joe once had a dream
The world held his hand, gave their pledge
So he told them his scheme for a Saviour Machine

They called it the Prayer, its answer was law
Its logic stopped war, gave them food
How they adored till it cried in its boredom

'Please don't believe in me, please disagree with me
Life is too easy, a plague seems quite feasible now
Or maybe a war, or I may kill you all

Don't let me stay, don't let me stay
My logic says burn so send me away
Your minds are too green, I despise all I've seen
You can't stake your lives on a Saviour Machine

I need you flying, and I'll show that dying
Is living beyond reason, sacred dimension of time
I perceive every sign, I can steal every mind

Don't let me stay, don't let me stay
My logic says burn so send me away
Your minds are too green, I despise all I've seen
You can't stake your lives on a Saviour Machine




Scary Monsters (And Super Creeps)

 

She had an horror of rooms she was tired you can't hide beat
When I looked in her eyes they were blue but nobody home
Well she could've been a killer if she didn't walk the way she do, and she do
She opened strange doors that we'd never close again

She began to wail jealousies scream
Waiting at the light know what I mean?

CHORUS (twice)
  Scary monsters, super creeps
  Keep me running, running scared

She asked me to stay and I stole her room
She asked for my love and I gave her a dangerous mind
Now she's stupid in the street and she can't socialise
Well I love the little girl and I'll love her till the day she dies

She wails
Jimmy's guitar sound jealousies scream
Waiting at the light know what I mean

CHORUS (twice)

CHORUS (twice)

Oh oh woh-oh
Oh, oh-oh-oh oh
Oh oh oh, oh oh




Scream Like A Baby

 

Well I wouldn't buy no merchandise
And I wouldn't go to war
And I mixed with other colours
But the nurse doesn't care
And I hide under blankets
Or did I run away?
I really can't remember
Last time I saw the light of day

But I remember Sam 'cos he was like me

CHORUS
  Scream like a baby
  Sam was a gun
  And I never knew his last name
  And we never had no fun

Well they came down hard on the faggots
And they came down hard on the street
They came down harder on Sam
And they all knew he was beat
He was thrown into the wagon
Blindfolded, chains, and they stomped on us
And took away our clothes and things
And pumped us full of strange drugs
And oh I saw Sam falling
Spitting in their eyes
But now I lay me down to sleep
And now I close my eyes
Now I'm learning to be a part of socie... socie... sss

CHORUS

No athletic programme, no discipline, no book
He just sat in the back seat swearing he'd seek revenge
But he jumped into the furnace
Singing old songs we loved

CHORUS (twice)

(Originally derived from I Am A Laser).





Scream Like A Baby - (earlier version)

 

Well I wouldn't buy the merchandise
And I wouldn't fight no war
And I mixed with the other targets
But the nurse isn't soft
And I hide under blankets
Or did I run away?
I really can't remember
Last time I saw the light of day

But I remember Sam 'cos he was like me

CHORUS
  Scream like a baby
  Scream like a gun
  I never knew his last name
  We never had no fun

Well they came down hard on the faggots
And they came down hard on the street
They came down harder on Sam
And we all knew he was beat
He was thrown into the wagon
Blindfolded, chains, and stomped on us
They took away our clothes
And pumped us full of strange drugs
I saw Sam falling
Spitting in their eyes
But they laid me down to sleep
And now I close my eyes
'Cos I'm learning to be an integrated part of society

CHORUS

No athletic programme, no discipline, no book
He just sat in the back suite swearing he'd seek revenge
But he jumped into the furnace
Singing old songs we loved

CHORUS (twice)

Sector Z

(Lyrics: Dave Gutter. Music: Gutter/McNaboe/Zoidis/Albee/Noyes/Roods/Ward)

Understand this
All the grown-ups produce communication
The Ava queen it's not a boom in the human nature
Home ? is all belongs
But in the smokey clubs you won't need oxygen and you won't need laser guns

We got reggae
We got raw
and a bullet from the core

We got surfing school
But not a surface with Avalon

(Are you listening?)
(Are you listening?)

(CHORUS)
  Is your volume up?  (is your volume up?)
  Is your power on?  (is the power on?)
  Do yourself a system at the speed of sound  (are you listening?)

  Which way does your antenna go?  (volume up)
  On your radio  (power on)
  This is rock 'n' roll  (this is rock 'n' roll)

At the show, get up, get ready to go
I know our planets cold at night
But just step inside the door
'Cos our satellites we try to light the sun
When all the lights going on, we're off, get up,
And when they're off we'll go home

On your planet you don't have rock 'n' roll
You don't have radio
You don't have disco lights
And you don't have Rubber Soul

(Are you listening?)
(Are you listening?)

(CHORUS x2)
  Is your volume up?  (is your volume up?)
  Is your power on?  (is the power on?)
  Do yourself a system at the speed of sound  (are you listening?)

  Which way does your antenna go?  (volume up)
  On your radio  (power on)
  This is rock 'n' roll  (this is rock 'n' roll)

"My children and parents listen to me well. You must not allow your children to recordings known as rock n' roll."





See Emily Play

(Syd Barrett)

Emily tries but misunderstands
She's often inclined to borrow somebody's dreams 'til tomorrow

CHORUS
  There is no other day
  Let's try it another way
  You'll lose your mind and play
  Free games for May
  See Emily play

Soon after dark, Emily cries
Gazing at trees in sorrow hardly a sound 'til tomorrow

CHORUS

Put on a gown that touches the ground
Float on a river for ever and ever
Emily

CHORUS




See Saw

(Claude Sutton/Howie Pratt/Rup Davies)

Your love is like a see-saw, baby, see-saw
Your love is like a see-saw, baby, see-saw
First it's up and then it's down
It changes so fast, it never hits the ground
It goes up, down and up, like a see-saw

When you said you'd been my baby, see-saw
When you said you'd been my baby, see-saw
I thought your love was sincere
But at this rate, it won't last a year
It goes up, down and up, like a see-saw

Monday, it's a-huggin' and a-kissin'
Tuesday, something I've been missin'
Wednesday, everything is fine
Thursday, you done changed your mind
Friday, it's the day we make up
Saturday, the day we break up
Sunday, things are going all right
Monday, you want to start up fightin'

Your love is like a see-saw, baby, see-saw
Your love is like a see-saw, baby, see-saw
First you're glad and then you're mad
You're the strangest girl I ever had
It goes up, down and up, like a see-saw

(Cover version of The Moonglows hit performed live by David Bowie and The Buzz).





Sell Me A Coat

 

La la la la la la, la la la la la la la

A winter's day, a bitter snowflake on my face
My summer girl takes little backward steps away
Jack Frost took her hand and left me, Jack Frost ain't so cool

CHORUS
  Sell me a coat with buttons of silver
  Sell me a coat that's red or gold
  Sell me a coat with little patch pockets
  Sell me a coat 'cos I feel cold

And when she smiles, the ice forgets to melt away
Not like before, her smile was warm in yesterday
See the trees like silver candy, feel my icy hand

CHORUS

See my eyes, my window pane
See my tears like gentle rain
That's the memory of a summer day

CHORUS (twice)

La la la la la la (repeat)

Seven

(David Bowie/Reeves Gabrels

I forgot what my father said
I forgot what he said
I forgot what my mother said
As we lay upon your bed

A city full of flowers
A city full of rain

I got seven days to live my life
Or seven ways to die

I forgot what my brother said
I forgot what he said
I don't regret anything at all
I remember how we wept

On a bridge of violent people
I was small enough to cry
I got seven days to live my life
Or seven ways to die

Hold my face before you
Still my trembling heart
Seven days to live my life
Or seven ways to die

The Gods forgot they made me
So I forget them too
I listen to the shadows
I play among their graves

My heart was never broken
My patience never tried
I got seven days to live my life
Or seven ways to die

Seven days to live my life
Or seven ways to die

Seven (repeat ad lib)




Seven Years In Tibet

(Lyrics: David Bowie. Music: David Bowie/Reeves Gabrels)

"Are you OK?
You've been shot in the head
And I'm holding your brains"
The old woman said
So I drink in the shadows
Of an evening sky
See nothing at all

The stars look so special
And the snow looks so old
The frail form is drifting
Beyond the ochre-zone
Turn to question the mountain
Why pigs can fly
It's nothing at all

I praise to you
Nothing ever goes away
I praise to you
Nothing ever goes
I praise to you

I praise to you
Nothing ever goes away
I praise to you
Nothing ever goes
I praise to you
Nothing ever goes away
I praise to you
Nothing ever goes, nothing ever goes
Nothing

(Derived from an instrumental piece entitled Brussels).





Sex And The Church

 

Though the idea of confession is said to be
The union of Christ and his bride
The Christian
It's all very puzzling

Sex and the church
Sex and the church
Sex and the church
And the church... and the church

All the great mystic religions
Put strong emphasis, on
The redeeming spiritual qualities
Of sex... of sex
Christianity
Has been pretty modern
About sex

Of sex
Of sex
Of sex
Of sex
Sex and the church
Sex and the church
Sex and the church
Sex... sex

I think there is a union
Between the flesh and the spirit
Sex and the church
Sex and the church

All religions' mother (spoken)

VERSE (twice)
  Give me the freedom of spirit
  And the joys of the flesh
  And sex... sex...
  Sex and the church

CHORUS (twice)
  Sex and the church
  Sex and the church
  Sex and the church
  And the church... and the church
  Sex
  Sex
  Sex and the church
  Sex and the church
  Sex and the church
  Sex... sex...

Sex

Sex and the church
Sex and the church
Sex and the church
Sex... sex
I love you.




Shades

(Iggy Pop/David Bowie)

You gave me a present
The paper was blue and green
I unwrapped it with pleasure
These are the best shades I've ever seen
You can be my girlfriend
Forever and a day
I never thought I was worth much
Or that anyone would treat me this way

I'm not
The kind of guy
Who dresses like a king
And a really fine pair of shades
Means everything
And the light that blinds my eyes
Shines from you

It makes me come in the night
It makes me swim with delight
I like this pain
I like this mirror
I like these shades

I could have had a problem
I might have never followed through
The other guys are in trouble
They wouldn't listen to a girl like you
These shades say something
I'll bet they cost a lot
I hope I don't break 'em
I hope we don't break up

I'm not
The kind of guy
Who dresses like a king
And a really fine pair of shades
Means everything
And the light that blinds my eyes
Shines from you

It makes me come in the night
It makes me swim with delight
I like this pain
I like this mirror
I like these shades

I like these shades
I like these shades




Shadow Man (demo version)

 

There's a man back a-ways
Who believes at where he is
And there's a girl
Up ahead who says she knows

And the street overflows
With the folk who understand
But for the guy who can't be seen

He's the Shadow Man
And the Shadow Man is close at hand

Take a turn and see his smile
Made of nothing but loneliness
Just take a walk and be a friend
To the Shadow Man

You can call him Joe, you can call him Sam
You should call and see who answers
For he promises to come running, guided by the truth
For the Shadow Man is really you

Look in his eyes and see your reflection
Look to the stars and see his eyes
He'll show you tomorrow, he'll show you the sorrows
Of what you did today

You can call him foe, you can call him friend
You should call and see who answers
For he knows your eyes are drawn
To the road ahead
And the Shadow Man is waiting round the bend
Oh, Shadow Man
Shadow Man, Shadow Man
It's really you, it's really you, it's really you
He's the Shadow Man

(Shadow Man appeared on a reel-to-reel tape dated 5.6.76. Recorded at Gooseberry Sound Studos, 19 Gerrard Street, London W1. Producer was John Shipcott. There were three versions of Shadow Man (complete, vocal only and full vocal with half backing track), Cyclops and The Invader. The tape was auctioned at Sotheby's in 1990).




Shadow Man (2000 version)

Shake It

 

  (Shake it, shake it - what's my line)
  (Shake it, shake it - what's my line)

I feel like a sail-boat
Adrift on the sea
It's a brand new day
So when you gonna phone me?

  (Shake it, shake it - what's my line)

I could take you to heaven
I could spin you to hell
Or take you to New York
It's the place that I know well

  (Shake it, shake it - what's my line)

Sitting on a flagstone talking to a faceless girl
  (Shake it, shake it - what's my line)
And I'm wondering what to say but my eyes do the talking so well

Duck and I sway - (what's my line)
I shoot at a full moon - (what's my line)
So what's my line - shake it, shake it baby
Shake it, shake it ooh

'Cos love is the answer
Love's talking to me
I'd scream and I'll fight for you
You're better than money

  (Shake it, shake it - what's my line)

We're the kind of people who can shake it if we're feeling blue
  (Shake it, shake it - what's my line)
When I'm feeling disconnected well I sure know what to do
  (Shake it, shake it - what's my line)
Shake it baby, well shake it, shake it

I duck and I sway - (what's my line)
I shoot at a full moon - (what's my line)
So what's my line
Shake it, shake it baby
Shake it, shake it, ooh
  (Shake it, shake it - what's my line)
Shake it baby
Shake it, shake it
  (Shake it, shake it - what's my line)
Shake it baby, shake it, shake it
  (Shake it, shake it - what's my line)




Shakin' All Over

(Heath)

When you're movin' right up close to me
That's when I get the chills all over me
Quivers down my back bone
I get the shakes in my thigh bone
I've got the shivers in my knee bone
Shakin' all over

Just the way that you say goodnight to me
Brings that feeling all inside of me
Quivers down my back bone
I get the shakes in my thigh bone
I've got the shivers in my knee bone
Shakin' all over

Quivers down my back bone
I get the shakes in my thigh bone
I've got the shivers in my knee bone
Shakin' all over

You make me shake and, I like it baby
You make me shake and, I like it baby
Oh, shake, shake, shake, shake...




Shapes Of Things

(Paul Samwell-Smith/Jim McCarty/Keith Relf)

Shapes of things before my eyes
Just teach me to despise
Will time make man more wise
Here within my lonely frame
My eyes just hurt my brain
But will it seem the same

CHORUS
  (Come tomorrow), will I be older
  (Come tomorrow), maybe a soldier
  (Come tomorrow), may I be bolder than today

Now the trees are almost green
But will they still be seen
When time and tide have been
Boy into your passing hands
Please don't destroy these lands
Don't make them desert sands

CHORUS

Soon I hope that I will find
A seed within my mind
That won't disgrace my kind




She Shook Me Cold

 

We met upon a hill, the night was cool and still
She sucked my dormant will
Mother, she blew my brain, I will go back again
My God, she shook me cold

I had no time to spare, I grabbed her golden hair
And threw her to the ground
Father, she craved my head, Oh Lord, the things she said
My God, she should be told

I was very smart, broke the gentle hearts
Of many young virgins
I was quick on the ball, left them so lonely
They'd just give up trying
Then she took my head, smashed it up
Kept my young blood rising
Crushed me mercilessly, kept me going around
So she didn't know I crave her so-o-o

I'll give my love in vain, to reach that peak again
We met upon a hill
Mother, she blew my brain, I will go back again
My God, she shook me cold




She's Got Medals

 

She'd walk through the door and she'd set up the drinks on the house
She played a good game of darts, and the men slapped her back
And never took her out
She wore a trench coat khaki
Her hobnail boots were full of holes
  She's got medals

Her mother called her Mary, but she changed her name to Tommy, she's a one, oh
She went and joined the Army, passed the medical
Don't ask me how it's done
They sent her to the front line
Fighting for her country's name
  She's got medals

She got very tired of picking up girls
Cleaning her gun and shaving her curls
Then the enemy dropped a bomb
Survivors there were none

People say that when the moon is full and all the stars have gone to bed
You can see her ghost but that's a lie because the naughty woman isn't dead
She deserted on the previous morning
Replaced her uniform with dresses silk and green
Called herself Eileen
Came to London Town
Now she's settled down
  She's got medals




Shilling The Rubes

 

Lay in the corner
How long have you been awake?
You lay out your life
How much did he take?
Never counting the change
Fast into another

It's only a ferris wheel
It's only a house of fear
It's only a three-ring circus
Ringmaster, cannonball
Never counting the change
Fast into another
Now he's gone

Gone - the day that he left town
Gone - he was shilling the rubes
Gone - let the tears of a clown
And he's gone
He was shilling the rubes

Fifteen new faces
Fifteen new days
Still won't forget him
Hot boiling craze
Never counting the change
He passed into another
Now he's gone

Gone - the day that he left town
Gone - he was shilling the rubes
Gone - let the tears of a clown
And he's gone
He was shilling the rubes

Gone - the day that he left town
Gone - he was shilling the rubes
Yeah gone - let the tears of a clown
Oh, he was shilling the rubes

(Believed originally intended for David's proposed 1973 stage version of 'Nineteen Eighty-Four' which was aborted after George Orwell's widow Sonia Blair refused permission. Also recorded during the Young Americans sessions on 13th August 1974 at the Sigma Sound Studios in Philadelphia, USA).





Shining Star (Makin' My Love)

 

Eddie boy lit like paraffin spending two weeks in a crack house
Burns on his brain like Chernobyl

Dean was seen with a two bag purchase
He was lying dead on his mother's bed
Someone for pray for - till I met you

Life is like a broken arrow - memory a swingin' door
I could be your great misfortune - I can make you happy every day of your life
Makin' my love like a shining star - takin' my love just a touch too far

Tessie turns tricks with a soul like ice 'cos love left holes
And four swell kids breaking her heart
I've got windows, I've seen much vice, I've touched down with vermin, cowardice, lice
And I say

Nobody cares what you do - please be yourself to death
I could be your great misfortune
Bet you'll never find a, bet you'll never find a better man
Makin' my love like a shining star
Taking my love just a touch too far

Peter met Frank formed a dummy run gang
Worked heist or hit for 10 g's flat
Blew heads outta shape in the name of Trotsky, Sinn Féin, Hitler cashdown
No hope heroes cover this page with debts in hell
And fingers in blood
Poor little bodies all covered in scabs threw it all away
Another life in the grave
Another life in the grave

Life is like a broken arrow - memory a swingin' door
I could be your great misfortune
Well I could make you happy every goddamn single day of your life

Makin' my love like a shining star
Like a shining star
Hey that's what you are
Like a shining star

Makin' my love like a shining star
Taking my love
Just a touch too far

Makin' my love like a shining star
Like a shining star
Taking my love
Makin' my love
Just a touch too far
Makin' my love like a shining star
Like a shining star
Taking my love
Just a touch too far
Makin' my love like a shining star
Taking my love
Just a touch too far
Makin' my love like a shining star
Taking my love
Just a touch too far




Shock For One

(David Bowie/Reeves Gabrels/Tony Sales/Hunt Sales)

 




Shopping For Girls

(David Bowie/Reeves Gabrels

Between the dead ring ash of extreme defence
The lonely groups of company boys
Snapping pictures of scrawny limbs and toothy grins
These are children riding naked on their tourist pals
While the hollows that pass for eyes swell from withdrawal
And he lies on a mattress in a rat infested room
Talking 'bout his family and the cold back home

CHORUS
  Between the dull cold eyes and the mind unstable
  No one over here reads the papers pal
  'Tween the dull cold eyes and the mind unstable
  He's a clean trick and he's shopping for girls

A small black someone jumps over the crazy white guard
Cranking up the volume of a Michael Jackson song

CHORUS

Where the Frangipani scents the air
She mouths a word that breaks his stare
He grunts his reply in a garrulous croak
"That's a mighty big word for a nine year old"

CHORUS

Shopping for girls, shopping for girls

You gaze down into her eyes for a million miles
You wanna give her a name and a clean rag doll




Shrinking Jimmy

(Emm Gryner/Holly Palmer/David Bowie/Mark Plati/Campbell/Garson/Dorsey/Hamilton)

Jimmy shrink that shirt again tonight
'Cos you know how much I love it when it's tight
Jimmy, Jimmy, shrink the shirt again!
Shrink that shirt again
Let's just be friends
(Shrink it one time)
Shrink that shirt again
Let's just be friends now Jimmy
You know how much I loved that shirt
And you know how much I love you
I miss you so much Jimmy
But when you're not here
I put that shirt on
And when I put that shirt on
And it stretches so tight across my nipples
I feel you Jimmy
You're here with me
Come back Jimmy
Come back...




Silly Boy Blue

 

Mountains of Lhasa are feeling the rain
People are walking the Potala lanes
Preacher takes the school
One boy breaks a rule
Silly Boy Blue, Blue, Silly Boy Blue

Yak butter statues that melt in the sun
Cannot dissolve all the work you've not done
A Chela likes to feel
That his overself pays the bill
Silly Boy Blue, Blue, Silly Boy Blue

You wish and wish, and wish again
You've tried so hard to fly
You'll never leave your body now
You've got to wait to die

Child of Tibet, you're a gift from the sun
Reincarnation of one better man

Silly Boy Blue - (1965 demo)

 

Tabletop mountain is feeling the rain
People are walking down Forest Bridge Lane
A padre takes the school
One boy breaks a rule
Silly Boy Blue, Blue

Fir cones lie heavy like gold in your hand
Feeling the soft dirt, it wrinkles like sand
One boy cried that day
Another ran away
Silly Boy Blue, Blue

I wish I wish, I wish again
I had not run away
But maybe soon I'll go back home again
They'll take me in again
They'll take me

La la la la la la la la la la (x2)
La la la la la (x2)
Silly Boy Blue, Blue

Memories I've seen are all dark in the past
Feeling him growing and ageing so fast
I've got the mail today
Oh, someone's passed away
Silly Boy Blue, Blue, Silly Boy Blue
Ooh Silly Boy Blue
Ooh Silly Boy Blue

(Appeared on an Oak label acetate, recorded October 1965 at R.G. Jones Studios, Morden, Surrey).

Silver Tree Top School For Boys

 

Here's the town in which I live, Petunia Green
Here's the shop and here's the man who sold me laces for my shoes
There is Mr. Marcus Bowles they say he's mad
'Here's the battle that I won' at
Silver Tree Top School for Boys

Pearly days were good as gold
An apple here an apple there
And everywhere a 'Yes Sir', 'No Sir'
They made me roll the cricket pitch once a day
I've never been so happy than at
Silver Tree Top School for Boys

The mowing machine was leaving small piles of grass
The wind had blown some blades into the pipe of Mr. Marcus Bowles
This manic teacher fell upon the cricket field
Smiling, laughing, rolling about at Silver Tree Top School for Boys

"Hey there" they call in the staff room
They call in the canteen "Hey come and look at what I found"
A thousand boys and Masters sitting
On the cricket ground at
Silver Tree Top School for Boys

The English master thought he was a purple mouse
And the Head, who's usually sad, was swinging from a tree
Mr. Brown the Physics man is off his head
And everyone just loves the grass at
Silver Tree Top School for Boys

La la lalalalalalalalala lalalalalalalala lalalalalalalalala lalalalalalalalala




Sister Midnight

(Iggy Pop/David Bowie/Carlos Alomar)

Calling Sister Midnight
You've got me reaching for the moon
Calling Sister Midnight
You've got me playing the fool
Calling Sister Midnight

Calling Sister Midnight
Can you hear me call
Can you hear me well
Can you hear me at all
Calling Sister Midnight
I'm an Idiot for you
Calling Sister Midnight
I'm a breakage inside
Calling Sister Midnight
Calling Sister Midnight
You know I had a dream last night
Mother was in my bed
And I made love to her
Father he gunned for me
Hunted me with his six gun
Calling Sister Midnight
What can I do about my dreams

Listen to me Sister Midnight
You put a beggar in my heart
Calling Sister Midnight
You've got me walking in rags
Hey where are you Sister Midnight
Can you hear me call
Can you hear me well
Can you hear me at all




Sixteen

(Iggy Pop)

Sweet sixteen in leather boots
Body and soul I go crazy
Baby Baby I'm hungry
Sweet sixteen
Funky bar all full of faces
Pretty faces beautiful faces
Body and soul
Body and soul
I give to you
I'm an easy mark
With my broken heart
Sweet sixteen
Show you my explosion
Sweet sixteen

Go out to the funky bar
I get hurt - crying inside
'Cos
Everybody's so fine and - and they
Don't need me
Tell me what can I do -
Sweet sixteen
I give you my body and soul
Sweet sixteen

I must be hungry
'Cos I go crazy
Over your leather boots
Now baby I know
That's not normal
But I love you
I love you
I love you
Sweet sixteen




Slip Away

 

Oogie waits for just another day
Drags his bones to see the Yankees play
Bones Boy talks and flickers grey
Oh, they slip away

Once a time they nearly might have been
Bones and Oogie on a silver screen
No one knew what they could do
Except for me and you
They slip away
They slip away

(Chorus)
Don't forget to keep your head warm
Twinkle twinkle Uncle Floyd
Watching all the world and war torn
How I wonder where you are
Ohhh-oo
Sailing over Coney Island
Twinkle twinkle Uncle Floyd
We were dumb but you were fun, boy
How I wonder where you are

Oogie knew there's never ever time
Some of us will always stay behind
Down in space it's always 1982
The joke we always knew
Oo-oo
What'sa matter with you?

C'mon, let's go
Slip away
Oo-o

(Chorus)




Slow Burn

 

Here shall we live in this terrible town
Where the price for our eyes shall squeeze them tight like a fist
And the walls shall have eyes
And the doors shall have ears
But we'll dance in the dark
And they'll play with their lives

Like a slow burn
Leading us on and on and on
Like a slow burn
Turning us round and round and round
But who are we?
So small in times such as these

Slow burn
Slow burn

Oh, these are the days
These are the strangest of all
These are the nights
These are the darkest to fall
But who knows?
Echoes in tenement halls
But who knows?
Though the years slay them all

Like a slow burn
Leading us on and on and on
Like a slow burn
Twirling us round and round and upside down

There's fear overhead
There's fear overground

Slow burn
Slow burn

Like a slow burn
Leading us on and on and on
Like a slow burn
Turning us round and round and round

And here are we
At the centre of it all

Slow burn
Slow burn
Slow burn




So Near To Loving You

 

 

(Song written by David when he was in The Manish Boys in 1964 or 1965).





Some Are



Sailors in snow
Send a callout raising hands
Some are bound to fail
Some are winter sun, ahhh

Sailors in snow
Send a callout raising hands
Some are bound to fail
Some are winter sun, ahhh

(Recorded during the Low sessions at The Chateau, Paris, France and Hansa Tonstudio, Berlin, Germany in 1976-1977).





Some Weird Sin

(Lyrics: Iggy Pop. Music: David Bowie)

I never got my
License to live
They won't give it up
So I stand at the world's edge
I'm trying to break in
Oh I know it's not for me
And the sight of it all
Makes me sad and ill
That's when I want
Some weird sin

Things get too straight
I can't bear it
I feel stuck
Stuck on a pin
I'm trying to break in
Oh I know it's not for me
And the sight of it all
Makes me sad and ill
That's when I want
Some weird sin
That's when I want
Some weird sin
Just to relax with
Yeah, some dumb weird sin
For a while anyway
With my head on the ledge
That's what you get
Out on the edge
Some weird sin

Things get too straight
I can't bear it
I feel stuck
Stuck on a pin
I'm trying to break in
Oh I know it's not for me
And the sight of it all
Makes me sad and ill
That's when I want
Some weird sin
That's when I want
Some weird sin
Just to relax with
Yeah, some dumb weird sin
For a while anyway
With my head on the ledge
That's what you get
Out on the edge
Some weird sin
Some weird sin
Some weird sin




Somebody Up There Likes Me

 

He...

He's everybody's token, on everybody's wall
Blessing all the papers, thanking one and all
Hugging all the babies, kissing all the ladies
Knowing all that you think about from writing on the wall

CHORUS 1
  He's so divine, his soul shines
  Breaks the night, sleep tight
  His ever loving face smiles on the whole human race
  He says "I'm somebody"

CHORUS 2
  He's got his eye on your soul, his hand on your heart
  He says "Don't hurry baby
  Somebody up there (somebody) likes me"

He's the savage son of the TV tube
Planets wrote the day was due
All the wisest men around
Predicted that a man was found
Who looked a lot like you and me, yeah
Everyone with sense could see
Nothing left his eye unmoved, he
Had the plan, he had to use

CHORUS 1 and 2

Somebody plays my song in tune
Makes me, makes me, makes me stronger for you, babe
Was a way when we were young
That any man was judged by what he'd done
But now you pick them on the screen
What they look like, where they've been

CHORUS 2

Leaders come, they hate all the people
That given time the leaders go
Tell me, can they hold you under their spell
Or can they walk and hold you as well, as a smile like Valentino?
Could he sell you anything?

Keep your eye on your soul, keep your hand on your heart
"Don't hurry, baby
Somebody up there (somebody) likes me"

  (somebody, somebody, somebody)
  (somebody, somebody, somebody, somebody, somebody, somebody)
Somebody (somebody) somebody (somebody) somebody (somebody, somebody)
Somebody (somebody) somebody (somebody) somebody (somebody, somebody)
Yeah, can't remember (somebody) peace so well
Oh, space to ramble, (somebody, somebody) space to boogie

Soul shine (Ooh-ooh)
So divine
Somebody (ooh-ooh, somebody)

Soul shine (Ooh-ooh)
So divine
Somebody (ooh-ooh)

Somebody, somebody, somebody
(Ad-lib)




Something Happens

(Colin Blunstone)

(Also referred to as 'Something')

 

(Supposedly an outtake from 1971 which appeared on the Starman Over The Rainbow bootleg. In 2008 it was finally exposed as a fake - 'Something Happens When You Touch Me' was written and performed by Colin Blunstone and officially released in 1995 on Live In Concert At The BBC).





Something In The Air

(Lyrics: David Bowie. Music: David Bowie/Reeves Gabrels)

Your coat and hat are gone
I really can't look at your little empty shelf
A ragged teddy bear
It feels like we never had a chance
Don't look me in the eye

We lay in each other's arms
But the room is just an empty space
I guess we lived it out
Something in the air
We smile too fast
Then can't think of a thing to say

Lived with the best times
Left with the worst
I've danced with you too long
Nothing left to save

Let's take what we can
I know you'll hold your head up high
We've raged for the last time
A place of no return

And there's something in the air
Something in my eye
I've danced with you too long
Yeah
Something in the air
Something in my eye

Abracadoo, I lose you
We can't avoid the clash, the big mistake
Now we're gonna pay and pay
The sentence of our lives
Can't believe I'm asking you to go

We used what we could
To get the things we want
But we lost each other on the way
I guess you know I never wanted anyone more than you

Lived all our best times
Left with the worst
I've danced with you too long
Say what you will
There's something in the air

We've raged for the last time
But I know you'll hold your head up high
There's nothing we have to say
There's nothing in our eyes

But there's something in the air
Something in my eye
I've danced with you too long
There's something I have to say
There's something in the air
Something in my eye

I've danced with you too long
Danced with you too long
Danced with you too long
And there's something in the air
Something in the air




Song For Bob Dylan

 

Now hear this Robert Zimmerman
I wrote a song for you
About a strange young man called Dylan
With a voice like sand and glue
His words of truthful vengeance
They could pin us to the floor
Brought a few more people on
And put the fear in a whole lot more

Ah, here she comes
Here she comes
Here she comes again
The same old painted lady
From the brow of the superbrain
She'll scratch this world to pieces
As she comes on like a friend
Couple of songs
From your old scrapbook
Could send her home again

Gave your heart to every bedsit room
At least a picture on the wall
And you sat behind a million pair of eyes
And told them how they saw
Then she lost your train of thought
The paintings are all your own
While troubles are rising
We'd rather be scared
Together than alone

Ah, here she comes
Here she comes
Here she comes again
Same old painted lady
From the brow of the superbrain
She'll scratch this world to pieces
As she comes on like a friend
But a couple of songs
From your old scrapbook
Could send her home again - ahh

Now hear this Robert Zimmerman
Though I don't suppose we'll meet
Ask your good friend Dylan
If he, he's wild down the old street
Tell him we've lost his poems
So we're writing on the walls
Give us back our unity, an'
Give us back our family
You're every nation's refugee
Don't leave us with their sanity

Ah, here she comes
Here she comes
Here she comes again
The same old painted lady
From the brow of the superbrain
She'll scratch this world to pieces
As she comes on like a friend
But a couple of songs
From your old scrapbook
Could send her home again

Oh a couple of songs
From your old scrapbook
Could send her home again
Oh, here she comes, ooh here she comes
Yeah, here she comes




Sons Of The Silent Age

 

Sons of the silent age
Stand on platforms blank looks and no books
Sit in back rows of city limits
Lay in bed coming and going on easy terms
Sons of the silent age
Pace their rooms like a cell's dimensions
Rise for a year or two then make war
Search through their one inch thoughts
Then decide it couldn't be done

Baby, I'll never let you go
All I see is all I know
Let's find another way down (sons of sound and sons of sound)
Baby, baby, I'll never let you down
I can't stand another sound
Let's take another way in (sons of sound and sons of sound)

Sons of the silent age
Listen to tracks by Sam Therapy and King Dice
Sons of the silent age
Pick up in bars and cry only once
Sons of the silent age
Make love only once but dream and dream
They don't walk, they just glide in and out of life
They never die, they just go to sleep one day

Baby, I won't ever let you go
All I see is all I know
Let's take another way down (sons of sound and sons of sound)
Oh baby, baby, baby, I won't ever let you down
I can't stand another sound
Let's find another way in (sons of sound and sons of sound)
(Sons of sound and sons of sound)
Baby, baby, baby, fire away!

(Recorded during the "Heroes" sessions at Hansa Tonstudio, Berlin, Germany in 1977).





Sorrow

(Feldman/Goldstein/Gottehrer)

With your long blonde hair and your eyes of blue
The only thing I ever got from you was sorrow
Sorrow
You acted funny trying to spend my money
You're out there playing your high class games of sorrow
Sorrow

You never do what you know you oughta
Something tells me you're a Devil's daughter
Sorrow, sorrow
Ahhhh, ah, ahhhh

I tried to find her
'Cos I can't resist her (I tried to find her)
I never knew just how much I missed her
Sorrow
Sorrow

With your long blonde hair and your eyes of blue
The only thing I ever got from you was sorrow
Sorrow
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh

With your long blonde hair
I couldn't sleep last night
With your long blonde hair




Sorry

(Hunt Sales)

Time is tight love always gets in the way
I'm sorry

Didn't mean to hurt you but I always do
I'm sorry
I'm so sorry

I'm so sorry
I'm sorry
You know I am

Well my eyes are pinned and my money's spent
I'm sorry
You know I'm sorry
I wouldn't do for me what I would for for you
Would you forgive me
I'm sorry
I'm so sorry

I guess I've thrown it away
I've thrown it away
Didn't mean to do it that way
I'm sorry
Time is so tight
And I mean it if I say
I'm so sorry
I didn't mean to hurt you
I'm sorry

I'm sorry
I'm sor-rrr-ry
You know I am




Soul Love

 

Stone love - she kneels before the grave
Her brave son - who gave his life to save the slogan
That hovers between the headstone and her eyes
For they penetrate her grieving

New love - a boy and girl are talking
New words - that only they can share in
New words - a love so strong it tears their hearts
To sleep - through the fleeting hours of morning
Love is careless in its choosing - sweeping over cross an' baby
Love descends on those defenseless
Idiot love will spark the fusion
Inspirations have I none - just to touch the flaming dove
All I have is my love of love - and love is not loving

Soul love - the priest that tastes the word and
Told of love - and how my God on high is
All love - though reaching up my loneliness evolves
By the blindness that surrounds him

Love is careless in its choosing - sweeping over cross an' baby
Love descends on those defenseless
Idiot love will spark the fusion
Inspirations have I none - just to touch the flaming dove
All I have is my love of love - and love is not loving




Soul Man

(Isaac Hayes/David Porter)

Coming to you, on a dusty road
Good loving, I got a truck load
And when you get it, you got something
Don't worry, 'cause I'm coming

I'm a soul man
I'm a soul man
I'm a soul man (come on!)
I'm a soul man

And that ain't all

Got what I got, the hard way
And I'll make it better, each and every day
So honey, I said don't you fret
'Cause you ain't seen nothing yet

I'm a soul man
I'm a soul man
I'm a soul man
I'm a soul man, oh

I was brought up on a side street, yes mam
I learned how to love before I could eat
I was educated at Woodstock
When I start loving, oh I can't stop

I'm a soul man
I'm a soul man
I'm a soul man (yeah!)
I'm a soul man

Just grab the rope and I'll pull you in
Give you hope and be your only boyfriend
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (yeah!)

I'm talking about a soul man
I'm a soul man
(And you're a) soul man
Soul man (oh Lord)
Soul man
(I'm a) soul man
(And you're a) soul man
(And you're a) soul man




Sound And Vision

 

Ahhh...
Ahhh...

Doo, doo, doo, doo, do-doh
Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, do-doh

Don't you wonder sometimes
'Bout sound and vision

Blue, blue, electric blue
That's the colour of my room
Where I will live
Blue, blue

Pale blinds drawn on day
Nothing to read, nothing to say
Blue, blue

I will sit right down, waiting for the gift of sound and vision
And I will sing, waiting for the gift of sound and vision
Drifting into my solitude, over my head

Don't you wonder sometimes
'Bout sound and vision

(Recorded during the Low sessions at The Chateau, Paris, France and Hansa Tonstudio, Berlin, Germany in 1976-1977).

    And I'm floating in a most a peculiar way
    And the stars look very different today

    For here
    Am I sitting in a tin can
    Far above the world
    Planet Earth is blue
    And there's nothing I can do

    Though I'm past one hundred thousand miles
    I'm feeling very still
    And I think my spaceship knows which way to go
    Tell my wife I love her very much she knows"

Ground Control to Major Tom
Your circuit's dead, there's something wrong
Can you hear me, Major Tom?
Can you hear me, Major Tom?
Can you hear me, Major Tom?
Can you

    "Here am I floating round my tin can
    Far above the Moon
    Planet Earth is blue
    And there's nothing I can do"




Space Oddity (re-recorded version)

 

Ground Control to Major Tom
Ground Control to Major Tom
Take your protein pills and put your helmet on

Ground Control to Major Tom
Commencing countdown, engines on
Check ignition and may God's love be with you

(long pause)

This is Ground Control to Major Tom
You've really made the grade
And the papers want to know whose shirts you wear
Now it's time to leave the capsule if you dare

    "This is Major Tom to Ground Control
    I'm stepping through the door
    And I'm floating in a most a peculiar way
    And the stars look very different today

    For here
    Am I sitting in a tin can
    Far above the world
    The Planet Earth is blue
    And there's nothing I can do

    Though I'm past one hundred thousand miles
    I'm feeling very still
    And I think my spaceship knows which way to go
    Tell my wife I love her very much she knows"

Ground Control to Major Tom
Your circuit's dead, there's something wrong
Can you hear me, Major Tom?
Can you hear me, Major Tom?
Can you hear me, Major Tom?
Can you

    "Here am I floating
    Far above the Moon
    Planet Earth is blue
    And there's nothing I can do"

Standing Next To You

(Marc Bolan/David Bowie)

(Spoken outro for Marc show):

"Thank you very much. David Bowie - the most amazing songs from his stunning smash but meanwhile personally until next series I hope you watch it forever. Till David comes back should be every year after - news in the world."

Get you down, yeah

Star

 

Tony went to fight in Belfast
Rudi stayed at home to starve
I could make it all worthwhile as a rock 'n' roll star
Bevan tried to change the nation
Sonny wants to turn the world, well he can tell you that he tried
I could make a transformation as a rock 'n' roll star
So inviting - so enticing to play the part
I could play the wild mutation as a rock 'n' roll star

Get it all yeah Oo yeah!
I could do with the money
I'm so wiped out with things as they are
I'd send my photograph to my honey - and I'd c'mon like a regular superstar

I could make a transformation as a rock 'n' roll star
So inviting - so enticing to play the part
I could play the wild mutation as a rock 'n' roll star

Get it all yeah
I could do with the money
I'm so wiped out with things as they are
I'd send my photograph to my honey - and I'd c'mon like a regular superstar

I could fall asleep at night as a rock 'n' roll star
I could fall in love all right as a rock 'n' roll star
Rock 'n' roll star
Rock 'n' roll star
(Spoken) "Just watch me now."




Starman

 

Hey now now, oh no no

Didn't know what time it was the lights were low oh-oh
I leaned back on my radio oh-oh
Some cat was layin' down some rock 'n' roll "lotta soul", he said
Then the loud sound did seem to fade
Came back like a slow voice on a wave of phase
That weren't no DJ that was hazy cosmic jive

(CHORUS)
There's a starman waiting in the sky
He'd like to come and meet us
But he thinks he'd blow our minds
There's a starman waiting in the sky
He's told us not to blow it
'Cos he knows it's all worthwhile
He told me:
"Let the children lose it
Let the children use it
Let all the children boogie"

I had to phone someone so I picked on you
Hey, that's far out so you heard him too?
Switch on the TV we may pick him up on Channel Two
Look out your window I can see his light
If we can sparkle he may land tonight
Don't tell your poppa or he'll get us locked up in fright

CHORUS (x2)

La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la (repeat)




Stateside

(David Bowie/Hunt Sales)

I'm going home
I've been gone much too long
She said she missed me
Since I been gone
I'll be back soon
Ain't no doubt
'Cos she said she wanted my loving, my loving

CHORUS (twice)
  No holding back I'm going home
  No holding back I'm going home
  I'm going Stateside with my convictions

I said I'm coming home soon
I don't know when
It will be sometime soon
Sooner than
I thought I'd be
I thought I'd be
I thought I'd be Stateside sooner than later

Marilyn inflatables home on the range
Where the living is easy on a horse with no name
Kennedy convertibles home on the range
Where the suffering comes easy on a blonde with no brain
I'm going Stateside
I'm going Stateside

I'm going home
It's been so long
She said she missed me
And all the fun we've had
I think it be the best way
She said she missed me in
Every, every way, so

CHORUS (twice)

I've been gone so long
I've been gone, I've been gone
I'm missing you

Marilyn inflatables home on the range
Where the living is easy on a horse with no name
Kennedy convertibles home on the range
Where the suffering comes easy on a ten dollar raise
I'm going Stateside
I'm going Stateside




Station To Station

 

The return of the Thin White Duke throwing darts in lovers' eyes
Here are we, one magical moment
Such is the stuff from where dreams are woven
Bending sound
Dredging the ocean, lost in my circle
Here am I
Flashing no colour, tall in this room overlooking the ocean
Here are we
One magical movement from Kether to Malkuth
There are you
Drive like a demon from station to station

The return of the Thin White Duke throwing darts in lovers' eyes
The return of the Thin White Duke throwing darts in lovers' eyes
The return of the Thin White Duke making sure white stains

Once there were mountains on mountains
And once there were sunbirds to soar with
And once I could never be down
Got to keep searching and searching
And oh what will I be believing and who will connect me with love?
Wonderful, wonderful, wonder when?
Have you sought fortune evasive and shy?
Drink to the men who protect you and I
Drink, drink, drain your glass
Raise your glass high

It's not the side effects of the Cocaine
I'm thinking that it must be love
It's too late - to be grateful
It's too late - to be late again
It's too late - to be hateful
The European canon is near

I must be only one in a million
I won't let the day pass without her
It's too late - to be grateful
It's too late - to be late again
It's too late - to be hateful
The European canon is here, yes he's here

Should I believe that I've been stricken?
Does my face show some kind of glow?
It's too late - to be grateful
It's too late - to be late again
It's too late - to be hateful
The European canon is here, yes he's here
It's too late, it's too late, it's too late, it's too late, it's too late
The European canon is near

Well it's not the side effects of the Cocaine
I'm thinking that it must be love
It's too late - to be grateful
It's too late - to be late again
It's too late - to be hateful
The European canon is near

I must be only one in a million
But I won't let the day pass without her
It's too late - to be grateful
It's too late - to be late again
It's too late - to be hateful
The European canon is near, yes he's here

Should I believe that I've been stricken?
Does my face show some kind of glow?
It's too late - to be grateful
It's too late - to be late again
It's too late - to be hateful
The European canon is near, yes he's near
It's too late, it's too late, it's too late, it's too late, it's too late 



Stay

 

This week dragged past me so slowly
The days fell on their knees
Maybe I'll take something to help me
Hope someone takes after me
I guess there's always some change in the weather
This time I know we could get it together
If I did casually mention tonight
That would be crazy tonight

Stay - that's what I meant to say or do something
But what I never say is stay this time
I really meant to so bad this time
'Cos you can never really tell when somebody
Wants something you want too

Heart-wrecker, heart-wrecker, make me delight
Night is so vague when it brings someone new
This time tomorrow I'll know what to do
I know it's happened to you

Stay - that's what I meant to say or do something
But what I never say is stay this time
I really meant to so bad this time

'Cos you can never really tell when somebody
Wants so much to stay
That's what I meant to say or do something
But what I never say is stay this time
I really meant to so bad this time
'Cos you can never really tell when somebody
Wants something you want too




Stay (Live 1976 bonus track)

 

This week has past me so slowly
The days fell on their knees
Maybe I'll take something to help me
Hope someone takes after me
There's always a change in the weather
This time I know we could get it together
If you would stay here tonight
That would be crazy tonight

Stay - that's what I meant to say or do something
But what I never say is stay this time
I really meant to so bad this time
For you can never really tell, when somebody
Wants something you want too

Heart-wrecker, heart-wrecker save me delight
Light can be vague when it sends someone new
This time tomorrow I'll know what to do
I know it's happened to you

Stay - that's what I meant to say or do something
But what I never say is stay this time
I really meant to so bad this time

For you can never really tell, when somebody
Wants so much to stay
Oh that's what I meant to say or do something
But what I never say is stay this time
I really meant to so bad this time
For you can never really tell when somebody
Wants something you want too

S-t-a-y
If you want to
If you want to
Wa... s-t-a-y
If you want to
You want to
If you want to
To
Stay, stay, stay, stay
Stay, stay, stay, stay, 
If... you... want... to... to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to
S-t-a-y

(Live from Nassau Veterans' Memorial Coliseum, Uniondale, USA, 23rd March 1976).





Strangers When We Meet

 

(Yooou, yooou, yooou)
(Yooou, yooou, yooou)

All our friends
Now seem so thin and frail
Slinky secrets
Hotter than the sun

No peachy prayers
No trendy réchauffé
I'm with you
So I can't go on

CHORUS
  All my violence
  Raining tears upon the sheet
  I'm bewildered
  For we're strangers when we meet

Blank screen TV
Preening ourselves in the snow
Forget my name
But I'm over you

Splendid sunrise
And it's a dying world
Humming Rheingold
We scavenge up our clothes

CHORUS
  All my violence
  Raging tears upon the sheets
  I'm resentful
  For we're strangers when we meet

Cold tired fingers
Tapping out your memories
Halfway sadness
Dazzled by the new

Your embrace
It was all that I feared
That whirling room
We trade by vendu

Steely resolve
Is falling from me
My poor soul
All bruised passivity
All your regrets
Ride rough-shod over me
I'm so glad
That we're strangers when we meet
I'm so thankful
That we're strangers when we meet
I'm in clover
For we're strangers when we meet
Heel head over
But we're strangers when we meet

Strangers when we meet (repeat ad. inf.)




Stupidity

(Solomon Burke)

All around the world
Every boy and girl
Come along with me
That's - a stupidity

All around the world
Every boy and girl
Take a lesson from me
That's - a stupidity

Papa says I look so crazy
Mama says I look a fool
I don't mind their criticism
They do that every day in school

So come along with me
See how much fun it can be
Watch it on TV
That's - a stupidity

So come along with me
See how much fun it can be
Watch it on TV
That's - a stupidity

So come along with me
See how much fun it can be
Watch it on TV
That's - a stupidity

All around the world
Every boy and girl
Come along with me
That's - a stupidity

(Performed live by Davy Jones and The Manish Boys).

Suffragette City

 

Hey man, ah leave me alone you know
Hey man, well Henry get off the phone, I gotta
Hey man, I gotta straighten my face
This mellow thighed chick just put my spine out of place

Hey man, my school days insane
Hey man, my work's down the drain
Hey man, well she's a total blam blam
She said she had to squeeze it but she... and then she...

(CHORUS)
    Oh don't lean on me man, 'cos you can't afford the ticket
    I'm back on Suffragette City
    Oh don't lean on me man

    You know my Suffragette City
    Is outta sight... she's all right

Hey man, ah Henry, don't be unkind, go away
Hey man, I can't take you this time, no way
Hey man, hey Droogie don't crash here
There's only room for one and here she comes, here she comes

CHORUS

Oh hit me!

CHORUS

A Suffragette City, a Suffragette City

Sunday

 

Nothing remains
We could run when the rain slows
Look for the cars or signs of life
Where the heat goes
Look for the drifters
We should crawl under the bracken
Look for the shafts of light on the road
Where the heat goes

Everything has changed
For in truth, it's the beginning of nothing
And nothing has changed
Everything has changed
For in truth, it's the beginning of an end
And nothing has changed
Everything has changed

(1st voice)
In your fear
Of what we have become
Take to the fire
Now we must burn
All that we are
Rise together
Through these clouds
As on wings

(2nd voice)
In your fear, seek only peace
In you fear, seek only love
In your fear, seek only peace
In you fear, seek only love
In your fear, in your fear
As on wings

Ohhh
Woooo

This is the trip
And this the business we take
This is our number
All my trials, Lord
Will be remembered
Everything has changed




Survive

(David Bowie/Reeves Gabrels)

Oh, my
Naked eyes
I should have kept you
I should have tried
I should have been a wiser kind of guy
I miss you

Give me wings
Give me space
Give me money for a change of face
Those noisy rooms and passion pants
I loved you

Where's the morning in my life?
Where's the sense in staying right?
Who said 'Time is on my side'?
I've got ears and eyes and nothing in my life
But I'll survive your naked eyes
I'll survive

You alone across the floor
You and me and nothing more
You're the great mistake I never made
I never lied to you, I hated when you lied
But I'll survive your naked eyes
I'll survive

Beatle boys, all snowy white
Razzle dazzle clubs, every night
Wish I'd sent a Valentine
I love you

I'll survive
Naked eyes
I'll survive
I'll survive
My naked eyes
I'll survive
I'll survive
Naked eyes
I'll survive
I'll survive
I'll survive




Sweet Head

 

I tried to break away from you
From the Spics and Blacks and the gum you chew
Where the posters are torn by the muggin' gangs
And by the faggy park and the burnt out vans
I've got ninety-nine years of laying in the dark and I'm far too young to lie
I've got ninety-nine ways to play my guitar it's going to pay me before I die

CHORUS
  So bob your sweet head
  Brother Ziggy gonna play
  I'm just about the best you can hear
  Gonna rock it in your head
  Shazam! and come ball
  With my guitar and me soprano
  We can give you sweet head

I'm tough as glass and clean as night
Well if looks can love we can love alright
I'm your rubber peacock angelic whore
I'm a rod iron face upon the wall
I had ninety-nine tales of murder come life and I'm running away from it all
I got a bedroom, every mirror in town they're gonna claim me if I fall

CHORUS

  So bob your sweet head
  Brother Ziggy gonna play
  I'm just about the best you can hear
  Gonna rock deep in your head
  Shazam! and come ball
  With my guitar and me soprano
  We can give you sweet head

Sweet head, gonna give you sweet head
(Spoken:) "While ya down there"

See my eyes of blocked emotion, see my tremble, see my fall
Traumatics thick and fast, your faith in me can last
Besides I'm known to lay you, one and all

Look south the way your Mother dwells
If she knew what's going down, she'd give you hell
I'm the kind of man she warned me of
Till there was rock, you only had God

You and I have a mutual vow
We both like young, and we both like loud
I got pretty shoes, and I'm kid and proud
I'm street side out with my ear to the crowd

CHORUS

  So bob your sweet head
  Brother Ziggy gonna play
  I'm just about the best you can hear
  It's gonna rock deep in your head
  Shazam! and come ball
  With my guitar and me soprano
  We can give you - sweet head

(Spoken:) Move along Sir!
Choo Choo, Choo Choo Oo




Sweet Jane

(Lou Reed)

Standing on the corner, suitcase in my hand
Jack is in his coat, and Jane is her vest, and, me
I'm in a rock 'n' roll band.  Huh!
Ridin' in a Stutz-Bearcat, Jim
Y'know, those were different times!
Oh, all the poet, they studied rules of verse
And the ladies, they rolled their eyes
Sweet Jane!  Whoa!  Sweet Jane, oh-oh-a!  Sweet Jane!

I'll tell you something
Jack, he is a banker
And Jane, she is a clerk
Both of them save their monies, ha
And when, when they come home from work!
Ooh!  Sittin' down by the fire, oh!
The radio does play
The classical music there, Jim
"The March of the Wooden Soldiers"
All you protest kids
You can hear Jack say, get ready, ah
Sweet Jane!  Come on baby now! Sweet Jane! Oh-oh-a!  Sweet Jane!

Some people, they like to go out dancing
And other peoples, they have to work.  Just watch me now!
And there's even some evil mothers
Well they're gonna tell you that everything is just dirt
Y'know that, women, never really faint
And that villains always blink their eyes, woo!
And that, y'know, children are the only ones who blush!
And that, life is, just to die!
And, everyone who ever had a heart, oh
That wouldn't turn around and break it
And anyone who ever played a part, whoa
And wouldn't turn around and hate it!

Sweet Jane!  Whoa-oh-oh!  Sweet Jane!  Sweet Jane  Sweet Jane
Sweet Jane  Sweet Jane

Heavenly wine and roses
Seems to whisper to her when he smiles, ah
Heavenly wine and roses
Seems to whisper to her when he smiles, hey!
la-la-la-la-la-la
la-la-la-la-la-la
la-la-la-la-la-la
la-la-la-la-la-la, oh
Sweet Jane!  Sweet Jane!  Sweet Jane!  Sweet Jane!  Sweet Jane!




Sweet Thing (working lyrics)

 

It's safe in a city
To love in a doorway
To wrangle some screams from the dawn

And isn't it me
Putting pain in a stranger
Like a portrait in flesh who trails on a leash

Will you see
That I'm scared and I'm lonely
So I'll break up my room
And yawn and I'll run to the center of things
Where the knowing ones say

I'm glad that you're older than me
It makes me feel important and free
Does that make you smile
Hello isn't that neat
I'm in your way
And I'll steal every moment
Cause the fake is so true that it rots all your structure away
Like the street-fleet who whisper
If this trade is a curse then I'll bless you and turn to the crossroad and the hamburgers

Is it nice in your snowstorm
Freezing your brain
Do you think that your face looks the same
Let it be
It's all I ever wanted
It's a street with a view and a taste
It's got claws - it's got me - it's got you

(Original working lyrics written during the Diamond Dogs sessions at the Olympic Studios, Barnes, London SW13 in 1974).

Will you see that I'm scared and I'm lonely?
So I'll break up my room, and yawn and I'll run to the centre of things

CHORUS
  Boys, boys, boys, boys, it's a sweet thing
  Boys, boys, it's a sweet thing, sweet thing
  If you want it, boys, get it here, thing
  'Cos hope, boys, is a cheap thing, cheap thing

I'm glad that you're older than me
Makes me feel important and free
Does that make you smile, isn't that me?
I'm in your way, and I'll steal every moment
If this trade is a curse, then I'll bless you and turn to the crossroads and hamburgers

If you want it, boys, get it here thing
'Cos hope, boys, is a cheap thing, cheap thing

Is it nice in your snowstorm
Freezing your brain
Do you think that your face looks the same?
Then let it be, it's all I ever wanted
It's a street with a deal, and a taste
It's got claws - it's got me - it's got you

Take It With Soul

(???)

 

(Performed live by David Bowie and The Buzz).





Take My Tip

 

You think you're gonna please her
So you walk right up and tease her
But she walks right on by
You're scared to walk beside her
'Cos you're playing with the spider who possess the sky
She got the green backs, my-oh-my
You gotta act tall, think big, if you wanna make a mark in her book
Gotta get ahead, get a car, fancy clothes
Or she'll throw you right off her hook
Here's the news - you are but one fish in her back garden scene
Gonna make like a shark to be free
Something bad on your mind
Take my tip - get on out
Take my tip - get on out

You can't give all you got to take something back
Before she'll put you right up on her rack
With some others in mind
Take my tip - get on out
Take my tip - get on out

You think you're gonna please her
So you walk right up and tease her
But she walks right on by
You're scared to walk beside her
'Cos you're playing with the tiger who possess the sky
She got the green backs, my-oh-my
You gotta act tall, think big, if you wanna make a mark in her book
Gotta get ahead, get a car, fancy clothes
Or she'll throw you right off her hook
Here's the news - you are but one fish in her back garden scene
Gonna make like a shark to be free
Something bad on your mind
Get it off, take my tip
Get it off, take my tip

You can't give all you have to take something back
Before she'll put you right up on the rack
With some others in mind
Take my tip - get on out
Take my tip - get on out
Take my tip - get on out
Take my tip - get on out




Take My Tip (alternate vocal)

 

You think you're gonna please her
So you walk right up and tease her
But she walks right on by
You're scared to walk beside her
'Cos you're playing with the type who possess the sky
She got the green backs, my-oh-my
You gotta act tall, think big, if you wanna make a mark in her book
Gotta get ahead, get a car, fancy clothes
Or she'll throw you right off of her hook
Here's the news: you are but one fish in her back garden scene
Gonna make like a shark to be free
Something bad on your mind
Take my tip - get on out
Take my tip - get on out

You can't give all you have to take something big
Before she'll put you right up on her rack
With some others in mind
Take my tip - get on out
Take my tip - get on out

You think you're gonna please her
So you walk right up and tease her
But she walks right on by
You're scared to walk beside her
'Cos you're playing with the body who possess the sky
She got the green backs, my oh my
You gotta act tall, think big, if you wanna make a mark in her book
Gotta get a car, fancy clothes, get ahead
Or she'll throw you right off of her hook
Here's the news - you are but one fish in her back garden scene
Gotta make like a shark to be free
Something bad on your mind
Take my tip - get on out
Take my tip - get on out

You can't give all you have to take something back
'Cos she'll put you right up on the rack
With some others in mind
Take my tip - get on out
Take my tip - get on out
Take my tip - get on out
Take my tip - get on out




Teenage Wildlife

 

Well, how come you only want tomorrow
With its promise of something hard to do
A real life adventure worth more than pieces of gold
Blue skies above, sun on your arms, strength in your stride
And hope in those squeaky clean eyes
You'll get chilly receptions everywhere you go
Blinded with desire - I guess the season is on

So you train by shadow boxing, search for the truth
But it's all, but it's all used up
Break open your million dollar weapon
And push your luck, still you push, still you push your luck
A broken nosed mogul are you
One of the new wave boys

Same old thing in brand new drag
Comes sweeping into view, oh-ooh
As ugly as a teenage millionaire
Pretending it's a whiz kid world
You'll take me aside, and say
"Well, David, what shall, shall I do?
They wait for me in the hallway"
I'll say "Don't ask me, I don't know any hallways"
But they move in numbers and they've got me in a corner
And I feel like a group of one, no-no
They can't do this to me
I'm not some piece of teenage wildlife

Those midwives to history put on their bloody robes
And the word is that the hunted one is out there on his own
And you're alone for maybe the last time
And you breathe for a long time
Then you howl like a wolf in a trap
And you daren't look behind

You fall to the ground like a leaf from the tree
And look up one time at that vast blue sky
Scream out aloud as they shoot you down
No no, I'm not a piece of teenage wildlife
I'm not a piece of teenage wildlife

And no one will have seen and no one will confess
The fingerprints will prove that you couldn't pass the test
There'll be others on the line filing past, who'll whisper low
I miss you he had to go
Well each to his own, he was
Another piece of teenage wildlife, oh-oh-oh-ohh
Another piece of teenage wildlife, oh-oh-oh-ohh
Another piece of teenage wild...
Life
Wild - Life
Wild - Life
Wild - Life




Telling Lies

 

Telling Lies

Gorgeous girls are bound to meet
To talk of stars and kings and feet
Through the chromosomes of space and time
Me I'm fast like bad infection
Gasping for my resurrection
Swear to me in times of war and stress
Telling lies, telling lies
Telling lies, telling lies

CHORUS
    (Oo - Ah, visionary)
    (Oo - Ah, visionary)
  Telling lies
    (Feels like something's gonna happen this year)
  Starting fires
    (Oo - Ah, visionary)
    (Oo - Ah, visionary)
  Telling lies
    (Feels like something's gonna happen this year)
  Telling lies
  
Shadow falls on shrinking smile
See me poised at the happy games
Standing in the mouth of all that's pure
Come straggling in your tattered rainments
You'll come to me in tears and blame
I'm your future, I'm tomorrow, I'm the end

Telling lies (Oo - Ah, Oo - Ah)
Telling lies (Oo - Ah, Oo - Ah)
Telling lies (Oo - Ah, Oo - Ah)

CHORUS (repeat ad lib)




That's A Promise - (1965 demo)

 

Baby, you can own two hearts
Baby, don't try to tear me apart
Someone's got to go and I won't, I won't
That's a promise

Baby, you can't fool around
Baby, can't turn me upside down
Someone's got to go and I won't, I won't
That's a promise

It's just a matter of time before you call him on the phone
Tell him please, please leave him alone
Please leave him alone
It's just a matter of time, call him on the phone
Tell him please, please leave him alone
Please leave him alone

Baby, you've got me used
Baby, can't you be like you?
Someone's got to go and I won't, I won't
That's a promise
(Ad lib to end)

(Appeared on an Oak label acetate, recorded October 1965 at R.G. Jones Studios, Morden, Surrey).





That's Motivation

 

Do you hear what I hear?
Do you see what I see?
Colin, I want you to use your imagination
You wake up one morning and you ask yourself:

Why it is so exciting?
What makes me dramatic?
You're trying to say something about yourself
The dazzling crime of wisdom

You fall for reality
You're bruised and bewildered
Then you learn to fall in love with yourself
That's motivation

You raise yourself high
Presenting your soul
You step from the shadows
You hear the command
An image to dream
You tremble permission
Tomorrow's rewards bloody skies of today
You'll step out of time
Into life's every dream
A life of such powerful meaning

Now you have class
Now you have splash
Now you have mass motivation

Here's an image I recommend
Here's a product you will die for
Here's a nightmare that will never end
??

You know you got something
You know you got style
We don't take much just a little bit
That's motivation

Welcome to the world of your dreams, Colin
Where you can be what you want
Commit horrible sins
And get away with it

  Lust
  Gluttony
  Pride
  Anger
  Sloth
  Avarice
  And jealousy

You know you got something
You know you got the style
We don't take much, but a little bit
That's motivation

No more false illusion
Goodbye to confusion
Stand out from the madding crowd
Motivation is symphony

Symphony in style - (that's motivation)
It's brilliant, original - (that's motivation)
Stimulating, encouragement - (that's motivation)
As precious from home - (that's motivation)
So what - (motivation)
Say what - (motivation)
New - (moti...)
So - (moti...)

Now you have class motiv...
Now you have mass motivation




That's Where My Heart Is

 

I just cannot believe
That you want me
Beg at your door
I just cannot believe
That you want me
Forever more
Time and time I tried to make you mine
I didn't think it would be such a short time
Before you came my way

Up where the moon is shining so bright
That's where my heart is tonight
Up where the moon is so bright
That's where my heart is tonight

I thought my day would come
When I would be
The only one
I thought my day would come
Under the moon
And under the sun
Now I shout through all the streets today
Lucky me, your love has come my way
Now tell me I was a fool

Up where the moon is shining so brightly
That's where my heart is tonight
Up where the moon is so bright
That's where my heart is tonight

I believe that dreams come through
I believe, because of you
He who made the stars in the sky
Made the world for you and I

I just cannot believe
That you want me
Beg at your door
I just cannot believe
That you want me
Forever more
Time and time I tried to make you mine
I didn't think it would be such a short time
Before you came my way

Up where the moon is shining so bright
That's where my heart is tonight
Up where the moon is so bright
That's where my heart is tonight

(Demo track recorded in 1965 appears on Early On 1964-1966).





The Bewlay Brothers

 

And so the story goes they wore the clothes
They said the things to make it seem improbable
The whale of a lie like the hope it was
And the good men tomorrow
Had their feet in the wallow
And their heads of brawn were nicer shorn
And how they bought their positions with saccharin and trust
And the world was asleep to our latent fuss
Sighing, the swirl through the streets
Like the crust of the Sun
The Bewlay Brothers
In our wings that bark
Flashing teeth of brass
Standing tall in the dark
Oh, and we were gone
Hanging out with your dwarf men
We were so turned on
By your lack of conclusions

Well, I was stone and he was wax
So he could scream and still relax, unbelievable
And we'd frightened the small children away
And our talk was old and dust would flow
Thru' our veins and lo' it was midnight
Back o' the kitchen door
Like the grim face on the Cathedral floor
And the solid book we wrote
Cannot be found today

And it was stalking time for the Moonboys
The Bewlay Brothers
With our backs on the arch
In the Devil-may-be-here
But he can't sing about that
Oh, and we were gone
Real cool traders
We were so turned on
You thought we were fakers

And now the dress is hung, the ticket pawned
The Factor Max that proved the fact
Is melted down
Woven on the edging of my pillow
And my Brother lays upon the Rocks
He could be dead, he could be not
He could be you
He's Chameleon, comedian, Corinthian and caricature
"Shooting-up pie-in-the-sky"
The Bewlay Brothers
In the feeble and the bad
The Bewlay Brothers
In the blessed and cold
In the crutch-hungry dark
Was where we flayed our mark
Oh, and we were gone
Kings of Oblivion
We were so turned on
In the mind-warp pavilion

Lay me place and bake me pie
I'm starving for me gravy
Leave my shoes and door unlocked
I might just slip away, hey!
Just for the day, hey!
Please come away, hey! (repeat ad inf.)




The Dreamers

(David Bowie/Reeves Gabrels)

Black eyed Ravens
They spiral down
They tilt his head back
To the flame filled sunset
Raise their guns high
As the darken falls
These are the days boys

Shallow man
Shallow man... and they
Eats in the doorway
With his head inclined
And he's always in decline
No-one heals anymore
So he shrinks as they ride
Under vermilion sky

So it goes
Just a searcher
A lonely soul
The last of the dreamers

Shallow man
Shallow man
Speaks to the shadows
Moves his trembling hands
And he's always a little late
For the dawning of the day

So it goes
Just a searcher
Lonely soul
The last of the dreamers




The Drowned Girl

(Bertolt Brecht. Translation: Dominic Muldowney)

Once she had drowned and started her slow descent
Down the streams to where the great rivers broaden
Oh, the open sky chant most magnificent
As if it was acting as her body's guardian
Wreck and duck weed slowly increased her weight
By clasping her in their slimy grip
Through her limbs, the cold blooded fishes played
Creatures and plant life kept on, thus obstructing her last trip

And the sky that same evening grew dark as smoke
And its stars through the night kept the brightness still soaring
But it quickly grew clear when dawn now broke
To see that she got one further morning
Once her pallid trunk had rotted beyond repair
It happened quite slowly that she gently slipped from God's thoughts
First with her face, then her hands, right at the last with her hair
Leaving those corpse-choked rivers just one more corpse

(Recorded for 1982 BBC TV production of Baal).

The Gospel According To Tony Day

 

The Gospel according to Tony Day (x3)
If I find a girl he'll take her away
Rotten Tony!

The Gospel according to Brendan O'Lear (x3)
If I buy him a Scotch, he'll buy me a beer
Tight fist, friends

The Gospel according to Pat Hewitt (x3)
If it's written on a sweater then I'd better not do it
Ah
Got to, got to

Your mind, blow it
Blow it

The Gospel according to Marianne Brent (x3)
She'll be mine if I pay the rent
Good old Marianne, who needs friends, oh

Waste of flipping time, take a look at my life and you'll see
Take a quick butchers, rotten Harry down The Oak
Wouldn't give you tuppence for him

There's always the Diamond friendly
Sitting in the Laugh Hotel
The hearts filthy lesson
With her hundred miles to hell

Oh, Ramona - if there was only something between us

The Jean Genie

 

Small Jean Genie snuck off to the city
Strung out on lasers an' slash back blazers
An' ate all your razors while pulling the waiter
Talking 'bout Monroe an' walking on Snow White
New York's a go-go an' everything tastes nice
Poor little Greenie
Ooo-oo

(Spoken: Get back on it)
  Jean Genie lives on his back
  The Jean Genie loves chimney stacks
  He's outrageous, he screams and he bawls
  The Jean Genie let yourself go! oh

He sits like a man but he smiles like a reptile
She'll love him, she'll love him but just for a short while
She'll scratch in the sand, won't let go his hand
He says he's a beautician and sells you nutrition
An' keeps all your dead hair for making up underwear
Poor little Greenie
Ooo-oo

CHORUS

He's so simple-minded he can't drive his module
Bites on the neon and sleeps in a capsule
Loves to be loved, loves to be loved
Ooo-oo (x2)

  Oh the Jean Genie lives on his back
  The Jean Genie loves chimney stacks
  An' he's outrageous, he screams and he bawls
  The Jean Genie let yourself go! oh

Go!
Go!

  The Jean Genie lives on his back
  The Jean Genie loves chimney stacks
  He's outrageous, he screams and he bawls
  Jean Genie let yourself go! oh!

Go!
Oh go!

Are trying to ditch the King
  (Of Stamford Hill)
Of Stamford Hill

CHORUS (twice)




The Last Thing You Should Do

(Lyrics: David Bowie. Music: David Bowie/Reeves Gabrels/Mark Plati)

What are you doing to yourself?
What are you doing to yourself?
What are you doing to yourself?
It's the last thing you should do

Nobody laughs anymore
Nobody laughs anymore
Nobody laughs anymore
It's the worst thing you can do

Save the last dance for me
Catch the last bus with me
Give the last kiss to me
It's the safest thing to do

Yeah (x2)

What are you doing to yourself?
What are you doing to yourself?
What are you doing to yourself?
It's the last thing you should do

Nobody laughs anymore

It's the worst thing you can do

Save the last dance for me
Catch the last bus with me
Give the last kiss to me
It's the safest thing to do

Yeah (x5)




The London Boys

 

Bow Bells strikes another night
Your eyes are heavy and your limbs all ache
You've bought some coffee, butter and bread
You can't make a thing 'cos the meter's dead
You moved away
Told your folks you're gonna stay away

Bright lights, Soho, Wardour Street
You hope you make friends with the guys that you meet
Somebody shows you round
Now you've met the London boys
Things seem good again, someone cares about you

Oh, the first time that you tried a pill
You feel a little queasy, decidedly ill
You're gonna be sick, but you mustn't lose face
To let yourself down would be a big disgrace
With the London boys, with the London boys

You're only seventeen, but you think you've grown
In the month you've been away from your parents' home
You take the pills too much
You don't give a damn about that jobs you've got
So long as you're with the London boys

A London boy, oh a London boy
Your flashy clothes are your pride and joy
A London boy, a London boy
You're crying out loud that you're a London boy
You think you've had a lot of fun
But you ain't got nothing, you're on the run
It's too late now, 'cos you're out there boy
You've got it made with the rest of the toys
Now you wish you'd never left your home
You've got what you wanted but you're on your own
With the London boys
Now you've met the London boys (3 times)

(Original 7" single version recorded with The Buzz at R.G. Jones Studio, 19th October 1966. Producer Tony Hatch).





The London Boys (2000 version)

 

Bow Bells strikes another night
Your eyes are heavy and your limbs all ache

Bright lights, Soho, Wardour Street
You hope you make friends with the guys you meet
Somebody shows you round
Now you've met the London boys
Things seem good again, someone cares about you

The first time that you popped a pill
You feel a little queasy, decidedly ill
You're gonna be sick, but you mustn't lose face
To let yourself down would be a big disgrace

The Man - (aka Shadow Man)

 

 





The Man Who Sold The World

 

We passed upon the stair, we spoke of was and when
Although I wasn't there, he said I was his friend
Which came as some surprise I spoke into his eyes
I thought you died alone, a long long time ago

Oh no, not me
I never lost control
You're face to face
With the man who sold the world

I laughed and shook his hand, and made my way back home
I searched for form and land, for years and years I roamed
I gazed a gazely stare at all the millions here
We must have died alone, a long long time ago

Who knows? Not me
We never lost control
You're face to face
With the man who sold the world




The Mirror

 

Wash your face before your faded make-up makes a mark
The mirror will watch over you
Pierrot never calls so pack your face and chase the dark
The mirrors hung up on you
Don't be last your friends and your reflections
It's autodirection now

Poor Harlequin, you're quite an exception
Fade Troubadour - on a downer
Gay Harlequin doesn't believe in you
Doesn't believe it's true - such a downer

(Written and recorded for 'The Looking Glass Murders' production for Scottish TV. Recorded at The Gateway Theatre, Edinburgh, Scotland on 1st February 1970).





The Motel

 

Well we're living, in a safety zone
Don't be holding back from me
We're living from hour to hour down here
And we'll take it when we can

It's a kind of living which recognises
The death of the odourless man
When nothing is vanity nothing's too slow
It's not Eden but it's no sham

There is no hell
There is no shame
There is no hell
Like an old hell
There is no hell

And it's lights up boys
Lights up boys

Explosion falls upon deaf ears
While we're swimming in a sea of sham
Living in the shadow of vanity
A complex fashion for a simple man

And there is no hell
And there is no shame
And there is no hell
Like an old hell
There is no hell

And silence flies on its brief flight
A razor sharp crap shoot affair
And we light up our lives

And there's no more of me exploding you
Re-exposing you
Like everybody do
Re-exploding you

I don't know what to use
Make somebody move
Me exploding
Me exploding you




The Mysteries

 






The Passenger

(Lyrics: Iggy Pop. Music: Ricky Gardiner)

I am the passenger
And I ride and I ride
I ride through the city's backsides
I see the stars come
Out of the sky
Yeah the bright and hollow sky
You know it looks
So good tonight

I am the passenger
I stay under glass
I look through my
Window so bright
I see the stars
Come out tonight
I see the bright
And hollow sky
Over the city's
Ripped backside
And everything looks good tonight

CHORUS
  Singing la la la la
  La-la-la-la
  La la la la
  La-la-la-la
  La la la la
  La-la-la-la
  La la

Get into the car
We'll be the passenger
We'll ride through the city tonight
We'll see the city's ripped backsides
We'll see the bright and
Hollow sky
We'll see the stars that shine
So bright
Stars made for us tonight

O the passenger
How how he rides
O the passenger
He rides and he rides
He looks through his window
What does he see
He sees the sign and
Hollow sky
He sees the stars
Come out tonight
He sees the city's ripped backsides
He sees the winding ocean drive
And everything was made
For you and me
All of it was made for
You and me - 'cos it
Just belongs to you and me
So let's take a ride and
See what's mine

CHORUS

O the passenger
He rides and he rides
He sees things from under glass
He looks through his window inside
He sees the things he knows are his
He sees the bright
Hollow sky
He sees the city
Sleep at night
He sees the stars
Come out tonight
And all of it is yours and mine
And all of it is yours and mine
So let's ride and ride
And ride and ride

CHORUS (repeat ad. inf.)




The Prettiest Star - (original single version)

 

Cold fire, you got everything but cold fire
You will be my rest and peace child
I moved up to take a place, near you

So tired, it's the sky that makes you feel tried
It's a trick to make you see wide
It can all but break your heart, in pieces

Staying back in your memory
Are the movies in the dark
How you move is all it takes
To sing a song of when I loved
The Prettiest Star

Staying back in your memory
Are the movies in the dark
How you move is all it takes
To sing a song of when I loved
The Prettiest Star

One day, though it might as well be someday
You will rise up high and take us all the way
All because of what you are
The Prettiest Star




The Prettiest Star

 

Cold fire, you've got everything but cold fire
You will be my rest and peace child
I moved up to take a place, near you

So tired, it's the sky that makes you feel tried
It's a trick to make you see wide
It can all but break your heart, in pieces

Staying back in your memory
Are the movies in the past
How you move is all it takes
To sing a song of when I loved
The Prettiest Star

One day though it might as well be someday
You and I will rise up all the way
All because of what you are
The Prettiest Star

Staying back in your memory
Are the movies in the past
How you move is all it takes
To sing a song of when I loved

One day though it might as well be someday
You and I will rise up all the way
All because of what you are

The Pretty Things Are Going To Hell

(David Bowie/Reeves Gabrels)

What to wear
What to say
What to do on a sunny day
Who to phone
Who to fight
Who to dance with on a Sunday night

I'm reaching the very edge, you know
I'm reaching the very edge
I'm going to the other side this time
Reaching the very edge

CHORUS
  You're still breathing but you don't know why
  Life's a bit and sometimes you die
  You're still breathing but you just can't tell
  Don't hold your breath but the pretty things are going to hell

I am a drug
I am a dragon
I am the best jazz you've ever seen
I am a dragon
I am the sky
I am the blood at the corner of your eye
I found the secrets, I found the gold
I find you out before you grow old
I find you out before you grow old

What is eternal?
What is damned?
What is clay and what is sand?
Who to dis?
Who to truss?
Who to listen to?
Who to suss?

I'm reaching the very edge, you know
I'm reaching the very edge
I'm going to the other side this time
I'm reaching the very edge

CHORUS

I am a dragon
I am a drug
I am the best jazz you've ever heard
I am a dragon
I am the sky
I am the blood at the corner of your eye
I found the secrets, I found the gold
I find you out before you grow old
I find you out before you grow old

REPEAT (4x)
  The pretty things are going to hell
  They wore it out but they wore it well

You're still breathing but you don't know why
You're still breathing but you just can't tell
Don't hold your breath but the pretty things are going to hell

Secret secrets never seen
Secret secrets ever green

I was running at the speed of life
Through morning's thoughts and fantasies
Then I saw your eyes at the cross fades
Secret secrets never seen
Secret secrets ever green

The secret life of Arabia
Never here, never seen
Secret life ever green

The secret life of Arabia
You must see the movie the sand in my eyes
I walk through a desert song when the heroine dies

Arabia (secret secret)
Arabia (secret)
Arabia (secret secret)

THREE TIMES:
  Arabia
  Arabia (secret secret)

The secret life of Arabia
Never here never seen
Secret life ever green

(Recorded during the "Heroes" sessions at Hansa Tonstudio, Berlin, Germany in 1977).





The Supermen

 

When all the world was very young
And mountain magic heavy hung
The supermen would walk in file
Guardians of a loveless isle
And gloomy browed with super fear their tragic endless lives
Could heave nor sigh
In solemn, perverse serenity, wondrous beings chained to life

Strange games they would play then
No death for the perfect men
Life rolls into one for them
So softly a supergod cries

Where all were minds in uni-thought
Power weird by mystics taught
No pain, no joy, no power too great
Colossal strength to grasp a fate
Where sad-eyed mermen tossed in slumbers
Nightmare dreams no mortal mind could hold
A man would tear his brother's flesh, a chance to die
To turn to mold

Far out in the red sky
Far out from the sad eyes
Strange, mad celebration
So softly a supergod cries

Far out in the red sky
Far out from the sad eyes
Strange, mad celebration
So softly a supergod dies




The Voyeur Of Utter Destruction (As Beauty)

(Lyrics: David Bowie. Music: David Bowie / Brian Eno / Reeves Gabrels)

Turn, and turn again
Turn, and turn again

I shake
And stare at the sun
Till my eyes burn

I shake
At the mothers brutal vermin

I shake
And stare at the watery moon
With the same desire
As the sober Philistine
An' I shake

Turn and turn again

Blood, the pain and blade
Turn and turn again

The screw
Is a tightening atrocity

I shake
For the reeking flesh
Is as romantic as hell

The need
To have seen it all

The voyeur of utter destruction
As beauty
An' I shake

Turn and turn again

I shake
Turn and turn again
I shake

I shake
I shake

VERSE (two times)
  Research has pierced all extremes of my sex
  Call it a day, call it a day
  Needle point life, blind the will to be next
  Call it a day, call it a day

Call it a day (x15.)
Today (repeat ad. inf.)




The Wedding

 






The Wedding Song

 

These are silver wings
These are golden eyes
These are floating clouds
Angel for life

Dreaming alone and I feel that someone
Listens to me
Angel for life

These are silver wings
These are golden eyes
These are floating clouds
Angel for life

Heaven is smiling down, heaven's girl in a wedding gown
I'm gonna be so good, just like a good boy should
I'm gonna change my ways
Angel for life

Of all the Saints alive
Don't I feel like a Saint alive
She's not mine for eternity
Though I'll never fly so high
I'm smiling

I believe in magic
Angel for life




The Width Of A Circle

 

In the corner of the morning in the past
I would sit and blame the master first and last
All the roads were straight and narrow
And the prayers were small and yellow
And the rumour spread that I was aging fast
Then I ran across a monster who was sleeping by a tree
And I looked and frowned and the monster was me

Well, I said "Hello" and I said "Hello"
And I asked "Why not?" and I replied "I don't know"
So we asked a simple blackbird, who was happy as can be
And he laughed insane and quipped "Kahlil Gibran"
So I cried for all the others till the day was nearly through
For I realised that God's a young man too

So I said "So long" and I waved bye-bye
And I smashed my soul and traded my mind
Got laid by a young bordello
I was vaguely half asleep
For which my reputation swept back home in drag
And the moral of this magic spell
Negotiates my hide
When God did take my logic for a ride
(Riding along)

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

He swallowed his pride and puckered his lips
And showed me the leather belt round his hips
My knees were shaking my cheeks aflame
He said "You'll never go down to the Gods again"
(Turn around, go back!)

He struck the ground a cavern appeared
And I smelt the burning pit of fear
We crashed a thousand yards below
I said "Do it again, do it again"
(Turn around, go back!)

His nebulous body swayed above
His tongue swollen with Devil's love
The snake and I, a venom high
I said "Do it again, do it again"
(Turn around, go back!)

Breathe, breathe, breathe deeply
And I was seething, breathing deeply
Spitting sentry, horned and tailed
Waiting for you

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh




There Is A Happy Land

 

There is a happy land where only children live
They don't have the time to learn the ways
Of you Sir, Mr. Grown-Up

There's a special place in the rhubarb fields underneath the leaves
It's a secret place and adults aren't allowed there, Mr. Grown-Up
Go away, Sir

Charlie Brown's got half a crown, he's gonna buy a kite
Jimmy's ill with chicken pox, and Tommy's learned to ride his bike
Tiny Tim sings prayers and hymns, he's so small we don't notice him
He gets in the way, but we always let him play with us

Mother calls, but we don't hear
There's lots more things to do
It's only five o'clock, and we're not tired yet
But we will be, very shortly

Sissy Steven plays with girls, someone made him cry
Tony climbed a tree and fell, trying hard to touch the sky
Tommy lit a fire one day, nearly burnt the field away
Tommy's mum found out, but he put the blame on me and Ray

There is a happy land where only children live
You've had your chance and now the doors are closed Sir, Mr. Grown-Up
Go away, Sir

Boo, de boo, de boo, de boo dup (repeat)




Things To Do

 

Sometimes, sometimes I feel blue
When I'm, when I'm feeling good
All I, all I have to do
Is think of you, you, you
And the things you do, do, do

I don't know the reason
That you've got me this way
But when I first met you
Oh happy day
I'll make my point here
I just gotta say
I love you, you, you
And the things you do, do, do

Well if the Lord is my shepherd
And Peter was a saint
It's kind of obvious to me
Big guy, a ???? you ain't
But if you turned at the reek?
I was cunning and mean
I'd have to think maybe
That the Lord himself could save me

Sometimes, sometimes I feel blue
When I'm, when I'm feeling good
All I, all I have to do
Is think of you, you, you
And the things you do, do, do

(Recorded during the Ava Cherry and The Astronettes sessions at the Olympic Studios, Barnes, London SW13 in November 1974).





This Boy

(John Lennon/Paul McCartney)

That boy took my love away
He'll regret it someday
But this boy wants you back again

That boy isn't good for you
Though he may want you too
This boy wants you back again

Oh, and this boy would be happy
Just to love you, buy oh my-yi-yi
That boy won't be happy
Till he's seen you cry-hi-hi

This boy wouldn't mind the pain
Would always feel the same
If this boy gets you back again
This boy. This boy

(Performed live at on 27th August 1972 at Bristol Locarno Centre, Electric Village, in Bristol, although appears incorrectly on several bootlegs as the Friars Club, Aylesbury gig from 18th July 1972).





This Is Not America

(David Bowie/Pat Metheny)

This is not America, sha la la la la

A little piece of you
A little peace in me
Will die (This is not a miracle)
For this is not America

Blossom fails to bloom this season
Promise not to stare
Too long (This is not America)
For this is not the miracle

There was a time
A storm that blew so pure
For this could be the biggest sky
That I could have the faintest idea

(For this is not America, sha la la la la, sha la la la la, sha la la la la
This is not America, no, this is not, sha la la la la)

Snowman melting from the inside
Falcon spirals to the ground (This could be the biggest sky)
So bloody red
Tomorrow's plans

A little piece of you
The little piece in me
Will die (This could be a miracle)
For this is not America

There was a time
A wind that blew so young
For this could be the biggest sky
And I could have the faintest idea

(For this is not America, sha la la la la, sha la la la la, sha la la la la
This is not America, no, this is not, sha la la la
This is not America, no, this is not
This is not America, no, this is not, sha la la la)




Threepenny Joe

 

 





Threepenny Pierrot

 

Threepenny Pierrot - we love you
Threepenny Pierrot - loves us too
Pockets of gladness, gay time eyes
Comical hero, Threepenny Pierrot

Happy little feet that dance all day
Lonely little heart with lots to say
Stepping footprints on your mind
Offering thoughts of Columbine

Bang the drum and blow the bugle call
Pierrot takes the stage to play for all
For here's a life his fortune rules
Forsaken by his Columbine

Threepenny Pierrot - we love you
Threepenny Pierrot - loves us too
Pockets of gladness, gay time eyes
Comical hero, Threepenny Pierrot

To tap his feet to greet dear Harlequin
The hearts of folks so keenly hard to win
A patchwork frame of tears and wine
Are nectar for cruel Columbine

???  the three he leaves the stage forlorn
Puppets cold, their faces sad and drawn
Relive each trial of rise and fall
The love which lacks between us all

Threepenny Pierrot - we love you
Threepenny Pierrot - loves us too
Pockets of gladness, gay time eyes
Comical hero, Threepenny Pierrot
(repeat)

(Written and recorded for 'The Looking Glass Murders' production for Scottish TV. Recorded at The Gateway Theatre, Edinburgh, Scotland on 1st February 1970).





Thru' These Architect's Eyes

(Lyrics: David Bowie. Music: David Bowie/Reeves Gabrels)

(Living in a golden age, the golden age, the golden age now) (x3)

An' stomping along on this big Philip Johnson
Is delay just wasting my time?
Looking across at Richard Rogers
Scheming dreams to blow both their minds
It's difficult you see
To give up baby
To leave a job
When you know
You know the money's from day to day

CHORUS
  All the majesty of a city landscape
  All the soaring days in our lives
  All the concrete dreams in my mind's eye
  All the joy I see
  Thru' these architect's eyes

(Living in a golden age, the golden age, the golden age now)
Cold winter bleeds on the girders of Babel
This stone boy watching the crawling land
Rings of flesh and the towers of iron
The steaming caves and the rocks and the sand

Stomping along on this big Phillip Johnson
Is delay just wasting my time?
It's difficult you see
To give up baby
These summer scumholes
This god damned starving life

CHORUS

It's difficult you see
It's difficult you see

CHORUS




Thursday's Child

(David Bowie/Reeves Gabrels)

All of my life I've tried so hard
Doing my best with what I had
Nothing much happened all the same

Something about me stood apart
A whisper of hope that seemed to fail
Maybe I'm born right out of my time?
Breaking my life in two

  (Throw me tomorrow... oh, oh, oh)
Now that I've really got a chance
  (Throw me tomorrow... oh, oh)
Everything's falling into place
  (Throw me tomorrow... oh, oh)
Seeing my past to let it go
  (Throw me tomorrow... oh, oh)
Only for you I don't regret
That I was Thursday's Child

Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday born I was (x2)

Sometimes I cried my heart to sleep
Shuffling days and lonesome nights
Sometimes my courage fell to my feet

Lucky old sun is in my sky
Nothing prepared me for your smile
Lighting the darkness of my soul
Innocence in your arms

  (Throw me tomorrow... oh, oh, oh)
Now that I've really got a chance
  (Throw me tomorrow... oh, oh)
Everything's falling into place
  (Throw me tomorrow... oh, oh)
Seeing my past to let it go
  (Yeah, throw me tomorrow... oh, oh)
Only for you I don't regret
That I was Thursday's Child

Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday born I was Thursday's Child
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday born I was Thursday's Child
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday born I was
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday born I was




Time

 

Time - He's waiting in the wings
      He speaks of senseless things
      His script is you and me, boy

Time - He flexes like a whore
      Falls wanking to the floor
      His trick is you and me, boy

Time - In Quaaludes and red wine
      Demanding Billy Dolls
      And other friends of mine
      Take your time

The sniper in the brain, regurgitating drain
Incestuous and vain, and many other last names
Oh well I look at my watch it says 9:25 and I think 'Oh God I'm still alive'

Should be on by now
We should be on by now

La, la, la, la,   la, la, la, la (x4 times)

You - are not a victim
You - just scream with boredom
You - are not evicting time

Chimes - Goddamn, you're looking old
        You'll freeze and catch a cold
        'Cos you've left your coat behind
        Take your time

Breaking up is hard, but keeping dark is hateful
I had so many dreams, I had so many breakthroughs
But you my love were kind, but love has left you dreamless
The door to dreams was closed, your park was real and dreamless
Perhaps you're smiling now, smiling through this darkness
But all I had to give was guilt for dreaming

We should be on by now (x5 times)
La, la, la, la,  la, la, la, la (x11 times)

Yeah, time!




Time Will Crawl

 

I've never sailed on a sea
I would not challenge a giant
I could not take on the church
Till the 21st century lose

I know a Government man
He was as blind as the Moon, and he
He saw the Sun in the night
He took a top-gun pilot, and he
He made him fly through a hole
Till he grew real old, and he
And he never came down
He just flew till he burst

  Time will crawl
Till our mouths run dry
  Time will crawl
Till our feet grow small
  Time will crawl
Till our tails fall off
  Time will crawl
Till the 21st century lose

I saw a black, black stream
Full of white-eyed fish
And a drowning man
With no eyes at all
I felt a warm, warm breeze
That melted metal and steel
I got a bad migraine
That lasted three long years, and
And the pills that I took
Made my fingers disappear

Time will crawl
Time will crawl
Time will crawl
Till the 21st century lose
Go!

Time will crawl
Time will crawl

You were a talented child
You came to live in our town
We never bothered to scream
When your mask went on
We only smelt the gas
As we lay down to sleep

  Time will crawl
And our heads bowed down
  Time will crawl
And our eyes fell out
  Time will crawl
And the streets run red
  Time will crawl
Till the 21st century lose

And our mouths run dry
  Time will crawl
And our feet grow small
  Time will crawl
And our tails fall off
  Time will crawl
Till the 21st century lose

And our heads bowed down
  Time will crawl
And our eyes fall out
  Time will crawl
And the streets run red
  Time will crawl
Till the 21st century lose

  Time will crawl
For the crazy child
  Time will crawl
We'll give every life
  Time will crawl
For the crackpot notion
  Till the 21st century lose

  Time will crawl
La la la la la la
  Time will crawl
La la la la la la
  Time will crawl
Till the 21st century lose

  Time will crawl
  Time will crawl
  Time will crawl




Tin Machine

(David Bowie/Reeves Gabrels/Tony Sales/Hunt Sales)

Tin machine
Tin machine

Take me anywhere
Somewhere without alcohol
Or goons with muddy hair

Tin machine
Tin machine

Tin machine
Tin machine

The zombies that I pass
The guy that beats his baby up
The preachers and their past

Tin machine
Tin machine

Tin machine

Baby doll
Baby doll

Clarity in prayer
There's more than money moving here
There's mindless maggot glare
Working horrors - humping Tories
Spittle on their chins
Carving up my children's future
Read 'em pal and grin

Raging raging raging
Burning in my room
C'mon and get a good idea
C'mon and get it soon
I'm waiting on the fire escape
I'm not exactly well
I'm neither red nor black or white
I'm grey and blown to hell

Tin machine
Tin machine

Make some new computer thing
That puts me on the moon
Not this psycho-time-bomb planet
Poised to meet its maker
Shake a leg

Tin machine
Tin machine

One sick deathless duty to remain endangered species
They reach right out to touch someone
Then wash their crusty hands

Tin machine
Tin machine

Baby doll
Baby doll

Blue suede tuneless wonders
Mass confusion - faithless blues
Night that spews out watchmen
Mopping up another fortune
Fractured words and Branca-sonic
Anger trapped behind locked doors
And right between the eyes

Raging raging raging
Burning in my room
C'mon and get a good idea
C'mon and get it soon
I'm waiting on the fire escape
I'm not exactly well
I'm neither red nor black or white
I'm grey and blown to hell

Tin machine

Tin machine
Tin machine

Tin machine
Tin machine

Tin machine
Tin machine
Take me anywhere




Tiny Girls

(Iggy Pop/David Bowie)

Well the day begins
You don't want to live
'Cos you can't believe
In the one you're with
'Cos you know her tricks
And you know her past
When she makes a face
You just have to laugh
And you feel like such a know-it-all
When you only want just a tiny girl
And you hope she'll sing

So you turn around
Toward the tiny girls
Who have got no tricks
Who have got no past
Yea that's what you think
And you hope she'll sing
But she sings of greed
Like a young banshee
And she wants for this
And she wants for that
What did you think




Tired Of My Life

 

I don't know why, but I'm tired of my mind
Pain is over me, overloading
I don't know why, but you're trying to be kind
Take off your silver smile, throw your head back
And cry, ahhh...

I don't believe, but I'm trying to decide
Which game is best for me, which can I bear
You don't perceive, so I'm leading you away
Home where you've never been, non-returning
So cry, ahhh...

Throw the rock upon a road and it breaks into pieces
Shake a branch upon the snow, the sun is defeated
Pull the curtains on yesterday and it seems so much later
Put a bullet in my brain and I make all the papers
Ohhh...

I don't know why, but I'm tired of my life
The clouds are in my eyes, overtaking
Ahhh..."

Tonight

(Iggy Pop/David Bowie)

VERSE
  I saw my baby
  She was turning blue
  I knew that soon
  Her young life was through
  And so I got down on my knees
  Down by her bed
  And these are the words
  To her I said

Everything will be alright tonight
Everything will be alright tonight
No one moves
No one talks
No one thinks
No one walks tonight
Tonight
Everyone will be alright tonight
Everyone will be alright tonight
No one moves
No one talks
No one thinks
No one walks tonight
Tonight

I am gonna love you till the end
I will love you till I reach the end
I will love you till I die
I will see you in the sky
Tonight




Too Dizzy

(David Bowie/Erdal Kizilcay)

There's too much talking for a night drive
Too much mist in front of my eyes
I'm trying not to lose control
But you're just pushin' for a fight
You look trapped, turn the radio on
Too much smoke, air conditioning gone
But I'm helpless in love with you
But you're just looking for a break

Is it love or is it what?
Who's this guy I'm gonna blow away?
What kind of love is he giving you?
I'm-a-dizzy's what I'm trying to say
Too Dizzy - You can't have a lover
Too Dizzy - It's me and no other
I'm a bad loser - I'm-a-shakin' in anger
Too Dizzy - you can't have no lover

2nd time: Don't come any harder
    Don't come any closer

You can go on dreaming every night
But I'm not letting you out of my sight
I'm-a-ten times the man than any guy around
But you're just itchin'-twitchin'-itchin' for a break

There's too much talking for a night drive
Too much mist in front of my eyes
But I'm helpless in love with you
But you're just looking for a break

Is it love or is it what?...

Truth

(Goldie)

Would you lie to me lately - truth
Would you die for me maybe - truth
Oh these ? ? ? ?

Truth

Tomorrow for you to know
That sorrow hides in sculpture
Truth
If a kiss could cry for you
Honest true
Then set in stone for you
Love me too
I'm ? away in ???? - truth

Would you lie to me lately - truth
Would you die for me maybe - truth
? these ? ?
Though I'd die to know if I choose ?
If I ???
If I could change my ways
Maybe I would
But there's a blind ?
Vision took enlightened me
Kiss the sky for me
And maybe I should
Or should I cry for you?
One day
One way

If a kiss could cry for you
Honest true
Then set in stone for you
Oh love be true
I'll set a light in me by your truth
But I'd die to know
Yeah I'd die to know

Would you lie to me lately - truth
Would you die for maybe - truth
All these ??? of ?
Tomorrow for you to know
That sorrow hides in sculpture
Tomorrow for you to know
That sorrow hides in sculpture




Trying To Get To Heaven

(Bob Dylan)

The air is getting hotter
There's a rumbling in the skies
I've been wading through the high muddy water
With the heat rising through my eyes
Every day your memory grows dimmer
It doesn't hurt me like it did before
I've been walking through the middle of nowhere
Trying to get to heaven before they close the door
Oh yeah

People on the platforms
Waiting for the trains
I can hear their hearts a-beatin'
Like pendulums swinging on a chain
When you think you've lost everything
You find out you can always lose a little more
I'm just going down that road feeling bad
Trying hard to get to heaven
Before they close the door

CHORUS (x4)
  Oooh, trying to get to heaven
  Before they close the door

I'm going down the river
Going down to New Orleans
They tell me everything's gonna be all right
But I don't know what "all right" even means
I close my eyes and I wonder boys
If everything is as hollow as it seems
I been to Sugar Town and shook the sugar down
Trying to get to heaven before they close the door
Hey-hey!

CHORUS (repeat ad inf.)
  Oooh, trying to get to heaven
  Before they close the door




Tumble And Twirl

(Iggy Pop/David Bowie)

I've seen the city
I took the next flight for Borneo
They say it's pretty
I like the tee shirts in Borneo
Some wear Bob Marley
Others in Playboy or Duvalier
Make the last plane come
Let me rise through the cloudy above
With a book on Borneo

Strangers come and go
It's such a waste of time
Problems far behind
Another day
But even in spring-time
It's a rich slice of life
So send me a letter
I'll reply with a broken spear
That dusky Mulatto
In nylons and tattoos
Hot juice in Coke bottles
We dance in the sand
Well, they twirl and they tumble

Yes, they twirl and they tumble
Well, I'll twirl and I'll tumble
I've been to Leon's
He's got nine daughters
And a stereo
They say that Leon
Watches from the tree tops
In Borneo
When the road is mud
Everything stops with a thud
That's the way it goes down yonder in Borneo
Far beneath his mansion
There's an open drain
Sending all the sewage down the hill
But when the General shows movies
No one hesitates
To sneak from the jungle
They laugh and they mumble
Enjoying the show
And that dusky Mulatto

Hot juice in Coke bottles
In blue jeans and tattoos
Well, they twirl and they tumble
Yes, they twirl and they tumble
Well, I'll twirl and I'll tumble

I like the free world
They say it's pretty
This time of year
They tumble and twirl
They tumble and twirl
I'll tumble and twirl

They twirl and they tumble
They twirl and they tumble

I like the free world
I like the free world

They say it's pretty

This time of year
This time of year




Turn Blue

(Lyrics: Iggy Pop/Walter Lacey. Music: David Bowie/Warren Peace)

See a black Eldorado
Rolling along down below my window
That black girl in the back looks pretty good
Christ! She's beautiful
You know how soft she is
I know just what it'd feel like
I'm so far away from her
Jesus, this is Iggy

You might as well
Come with me
Then you ride
There's talk
And I don't wanna talk
Oh momma
I shot myself down
Oh momma
I shot myself down
Ohhh, momma
I shot myself down
Oooh, momma
Did I tell you
I shot myself down

They're stepping on our hearts    (stepping on our hearts)
Stepping on our hearts
I don't know why
They're stepping on our hearts    (stepping on our hearts)
Stepping on our hearts
Damn, I don't know why
They're stepping on our hearts
Stepping on our hearts (x4)
Can't you see
Stepping on our hearts

How come the blacks
How come they come to you so good?
They get off on you so sexually
If you wanna make it
Young man, you've gotta make somebody come
Come out of you black
Come out of you black and strong
Black and strong
Black and strong
Black
Strong
Black

Jesus it's cold in this room
You know I, I never told you 'bout this
But there's one guy - somebody I really love
He's never around
We'd take things that could be alright, that could be nice
And make 'em so ugly, so damned ugly
And we put out the lights on'm
We make it dark, we put out the lights!
On them
It's idiots like you that screw me up
I know there's nothing to you
And I don't know why I treat you so kind
Up, down and dance with me
Dance with me
You got nobody left but me
Accept me
Don't reject me
Don't forget me

Momma
What colour will the lights be?
Will they turn blow on me?
Momma
What colour will the lights be?
Will they turn blue on me?
Momma    (will they turn blue on me)
I shot myself up
Oh momma
I shot myself    (up, up, up, up, up, up)
Momma
I shot myself up    (up, up, up, up, up)
Momma
I shot myself up
Down
Up
Down
Momma
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Momma
I didn't know what I was doing
I didn't mean to
But I did
Shot myself

Oh oh oh oh oh    oh oh oh oh oh
(Whispered) TVC 15
Oh oh oh oh oh    oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh    oh oh oh oh oh
Oooooo-oo

Up every evening 'bout (ten) half eight or nine
I'll give my, complete attention to a very good friend of mine
He's quadrophonic, he's a, he's got more channels
So hologramic, oh my TVC one five
I brought my baby home, she, she sat around forlorn
She saw my TVC one five, baby's gone, she
She crawled right in, oh my my
She crawled right in my
So hologramic, oh my TVC one five
Oh so demonic, oh my TVC one five

VERSE
  Maybe if I pray every, each night I sit there pleading
  "Send back my dream test baby, she's my main feature, ah"
  My TVC one five, he, he just stares back unblinking
  So hologramic, oh my TVC one five
  One of these nights I may just
  Jump down that rainbow way, be with my baby then
  We'll spend some time together
  So hologramic, oh my TVC one five
  My baby's in there some place, love's rating in the sky
  So hologramic, oh my TVC one five

CHORUS

Oh my TVC one five, oh oh, TVC one five (repeat 7 times and fade)




Twentieth Century Boy

(Marc Bolan)

Ohhhhhhh!

Friends say it's fine
Friends say it's good
Everybody says it's just like Robin Hood
I walk like a rat
Crawl like a cat
Sting like a bee
Babe I'm gonna be your man

And it's plain to see
You were meant for me
Yeah, I'm your toy
Your 20th Century boy

Friends say it's fine
Friends say it's good
Everybody says it's just like Robin Hood
Fly like a plane
Drive like a car
Ball like a hound
Babe I'm gonna be your man

And it's plain to see
You were meant for me
Yeah, I'm your toy
Your 20th Century boy
20th Century boy, I wanna be your toy (x4)

Friends say it's fine
Friends say it's good
Everybody says it's just like Robin Hood

You were meant for me
Yeah I'm your toy
Your 20th Century boy

Uncle Arthur

 

Strikes the bell for 5 o'clock, Uncle Arthur closes shop
Screws the tops on all the bottles, turns the lights out, locks it up
Climbs across his bike and he's away
Cycles past the gas works, past the river, down the high street
Back to mother, it's another empty day

Uncle Arthur likes his mummy
Uncle Arthur still reads comics
Uncle Arthur follows Batman

Round and round the rumours fly, how he ran away from mum
On his 32nd birthday, told her that he'd found a chum
Mother cried and raved and yelled and fussed
Arthur left her no illusion, brought the girl round, save confusion
Sally was the real thing, not just lust

Uncle Arthur vanished quickly
Uncle Arthur and his new bride
Uncle Arthur follows Sally

Round and round goes Arthur's head, hasn't eaten well for days
Little Sally may be lovely, but cooking leaves her in a maze
Uncle Arthur packed his bags and fled
Back to mother, all's forgiven, serving in the family shop
He gets his pocket money, he's well fed

Uncle Arthur past the gas works
Uncle Arthur past the river
Uncle Arthur down the high street
Uncle Arthur follows mother




Uncle Floyd

 

Oogie: "I was just thinking. Did you ever stop and think if there wasn't an Uncle Floyd show what everyone on the show would be doing?"

Uncle Floyd: "Why Oogie I think about that all the time."

Oogie: "I was thinking about it. Take Skip for instance. He wouldn't have anything to worry about he always had a good job as a radio announcer and he would of been in showbiz anyway.

"How about Mugsy? Mugsy would never have to worry he's a musician he could always work as a musician.

"And Netto? Netto wouldn't worry. He wouldn't even notice the show was off the air.

"And how about Charlie? He wouldn't have to worries. He still lives at home.

"Nah, and how about Scott? He would sit home around the home all day and wait till silent movies came back.

"And I was thinking, thinking about you Uncle F. What would you do?"


Oogie waits just another day
Drags his bones to see the Yankees play
Bones Boy talks and flickers grey
Oh, they slip away

Slip away

Once a time they nearly might have been
Bones and Oogie on a moving screen
No one knew what they could do
Except for me and you
They slip away
They slip away

Oogie knew there's never ever time
Some of us will always stay behind
Down in space it's always 1982
The joke we always knew
Oo-oo
What'sa matter with you?
C'mon, let's go
Slip away
Oo-o

(Chorus)
    Don't forget to keep your head warm
    Twinkle twinkle Uncle Floyd
    Watching all the world and war torn
    How I wonder where you are?
    Ohhh-oo
    Sailing over Coney Island
    Twinkle twinkle Uncle Floyd
    We were dumb but you were fun, boy
    How I wonder where you are?

Oh-o-o

(Recorded for the planned March 2001 unreleased album Toy. The song was later reworked and released as Slip Away and appeared on Heathen).





Under Pressure

(David Bowie / Freddie Mercury / John Deacon / Roger Taylor / Brian May)

Bah, bah, bah, bah, bah, bah, bah, bah
Bah, bah, bah, bah, bah, bah

Pressure, pushing down on me
Pressing down on you, no man ask for
Under pressure, that burns a building down
Splits a family in two
Puts people on streets

Bah, bah, bah, bah, bah, bah
Bah, bah, bah, bah, bah, bah

That's okay
It's the terror of knowing
What this world is about
Watching some good friends
Screaming "Let me out"
Pray tomorrow takes me higher
Pressure on people, people on streets

Doh doh doh bah bah bah bah
Okay
Chipping around, kick my brains around the floor
These are the days it never rains but it pours
People on streets, people on streets

It's the terror of knowing
What this world is about
Watching some good friends
Screaming "Let me out"
Pray tomorrow take me higher
Pressure on people, people on streets

Turned away from it all, like a blind man
Sat on a fence but it don't work
Keep coming up with love
But it's so slashed and torn
Why why why?
Love love love love

Insanity laughs, under pressure we're cracking
Can't we give ourselves one more chance
Why can't we give love one more chance
Why can't we give love, give love, give love, give love, give love

'Cos love's such an old fashioned word
And love dares you to care
For the people on the edge of the night
And love dares you to change our way of
Caring about ourselves

This is our last dance (x 2)
This is ourselves
Under pressure
Under pressure
Pressure




Under The God

 

Skin dance back-a-the condo
Skinheads getting to school
Beating on Blacks with a baseball bat
Racism back in rule

White trash picking up Nazi flags
While you was gone, there was war
This is the West, get used to it
They put a swastika over the door

CHORUS
  Under the God
  Under the God
  One step over the red line
  Under the God
  Under the God
  Ten steps over the crazy crazy

Washing their heads in the toilet bowl
They don't see supremacist hate
Right wing dicks in their boiler suits
Picking out who to annihilate

Toxic jungle of Uzi trail
Tribesmen just wouldn't live here
Fascist flare is fashion cool
You're dead - you just ain't buried (yet)

  Under the God
  Under the God
  Oh yeah
  Under the God
  Under the God

As the walls came tumbling down
Though the secrets that we share
I believed you by the palace gate
But now the savage days are here

Under the Gods
Crazy eyed man with a shotgun
Hot headed creep with a knife
Love and peace and harmony
Love you could cut with a life

CHORUS




Underground

 

No one can blame you
For walking away
But too much rejection
No love injection
Life can't be easy
It's not always swell
But don't tell me truth hurts, little girl
'Cos it hurts like hell (echo)
But down in the underground (oh oh oh oh oh)
You'll find someone true (down underground)
Down in the underground (oh oh oh oh oh)
A land serene (oh oh oh oh)
A crystal moon, ah, ah

It's only forever
Not long at all
The lost and lonely
That's underground
Underground

Daddy, daddy, get me out of here (heard about a place today)
I, I'm underground (nothing never hurts again)
Heard about a place today (daddy, get me out of here)

Untitled No. 1

 

In mornings she's so regal that the valley sighs
In the chilly sea that killed her real slow
Now we're swimming up farther with the doll by our sides
Fill the cup with these sleepy souls

CHORUS
  Sleepy Kapoor
  It's clear that some things never take
  Sleepy Kapoor
  Please, heal these tears
  Sleepy Kapoor

She will feel like at tea, make me laugh all along
With such feats like sex only brought upon
Oh lady, oh baby, maybe I'll live my lies alone
Jesus, up here, hear me, I, up-up-up above

CHORUS

Please heal these tears

CHORUS repeat

Some things never
Never never




Unwashed and Somewhat Slightly Dazed

 

Spy, spy, pretty girl
I see you see me through your window
Don't turn your nose up
Well, you can if you need to, you won't be the first or last
It must strain you to look down so far from your father's house
And I know what a louse like me in his house could do for you
I'm the cream
Of the Great Utopia dream
And you're the gleam
In the depths of your banker's spleen

I'm a phallus in pigtails
And there's blood on my nose
And my tissue is rotting
Where the rats chew my bones
And my eye sockets empty
See nothing but pain
I keep having this brainstorm
About twelve times a day
So now, you could spend the morning walking with me, quite amazed
As I'm unwashed and somewhat slightly dazed

I got eyes in my backside
That see electric tomatoes
On credit card rye bread
There are children in washrooms
Holding hands with a Queen
And my heads full of murders
Where only killers scream
So now you could spend the morning talking with me quite amazed
As I'm raving mad and somewhat slightly dazed

Now you run from your window
To the porcelain bowl
And you're sick from your ears
To the red parquet floor
And the Braque on the wall
Slides down your front
And eats through your belly
It's very catching
So now, you should spend the morning lying to your father quite amazed
About the strange unwashed and happily slightly dazed
Oh - o - yea' - oh - (purr) - oooh! - dar-nah-nah-naru - na




Up The Hill Backwards

 

Vacuum created by the arrival of freedom
And the possibilities it seems to offer
It's got nothing to do with you, if one can grasp it
It's got nothing to do with you, if one can grasp it

A series of shocks - sneakers fall apart
Earth keeps on rolling - witnesses falling
It's got nothing to do with you, if one can grasp it
It's got nothing to do with you, if one can grasp it

Yeah, yeah, yeah - up the hill backwards
It'll be alright ooo-ooo

While we sleep they go to work
We're legally crippled it's the death of love
It's got nothing to do with you, if one can grasp it
It's got nothing to do with you, if one can grasp it

More idols than realities, ooo-ooo
I'm OK, you're so-so, ooo-ooo

Yeah, yeah, yeah - up the hill backwards
It'll be alright ooo-ooo




Up The Hill Backwards - (earlier version)

 

Vacuum created by the arrival of freedom
And the possibilities it seems to offer
It's got nothing to do with you, if one can grasp them
It's got nothing to do with you, if one can grasp them

A series of shocks - sneakers fall apart
Earth keeps on rolling - skylights are falling
It's got nothing to do with you, if one can grasp them
It's got nothing to do with you, if one can grasp them

Yeah, yeah, yeah - up the hill backwards
It'll be alright ooo-ooo

While we sleep they go to work
They're legally crippled it's the death of love

We All Go Through

(David Bowie/Reeves Gabrels)

Skeletal city highs
Crazies with dumb replies
Nobody's eyes anymore

Frown on your beggar's face
Walking this lunarscape
Nothing in my lack-a-day

CHORUS
  We'll all be right
  We'll all be right
  We'll all be right in the now
  We all go through
  We all go through
  We all go through it sometimes

Somebody's space to rent
Somebody's soul to dent
Dog is in every word

Hiding the flames of power
Hiding the zone by hour
Nearly got out yesterday

CHORUS

Trouble it travels on the wing
Doorway to door
Open your eyes
Nothing remains
A secret love between us

Nothing can hide for long
We are the morning song
Holding my breath anyway

CHORUS (x2)




We Are Hungry Men

 

(Spoken):
Here is the news...
According to the latest world population survey
Figures have reached danger point, my God
London: Fifteen million seventy-five thousand
New York: Eighty million
Paris: Fifty million and thirty
China: One-thousand million
Billington Spa: Lots

My studies included exophagy
I formed my own society
To crush the power of fecundity
The world will overpopulate
Unless you claim infertility
So who will buy a drink for me, your Messiah

We are not your friends
We don't give a damn for what you're saying
We're here to live our lives

I propose to give the pill
Free of charge to those that feel
That they are not invertible
The crops of few, the cattle gone
There's only one way to linger on
So who will buy a drink for me, your Messiah

We are not your friends
We don't give a damn for what you're saying
We're here to live our lives

(spoken)
Achtung, achtung, these are your orders...
Anyone found guilty of consuming more than their allotted amount of air
Will be slaughtered and cremated
Only one cubic foot of air is...

I prepared a document, legalising mass abortion
We will turn a blind eye to infanticide

We are not your friends
We don't give a damn for what you're saying
We're here to live our lives

You don't seem to hear me clear
Do I talk above your sphere?
Let me explain my project dear
Show you how I'll save the world
Or let it die within the year
Why do you look that way at me, your Messiah

We are not your friends
We don't give a damn for what you're saying
We're here to live our lives

We are hungry men
We don't give a damn for what you're saying
We're here to eat you!




We Are The Dead

 

Something kind of hit me today
I looked at you and wondered if you saw things my way
People will hold us to blame
It hit me today, it hit me today

We're taking it hard all the time
Why don't we pass it by?
Just reply, you've changed your mind
We're fighting with the eyes of the blind
Taking it hard, taking it hard

Yet now
We feel that we are paper, choking on you nightly
They tell me "Son, we want you, be elusive, but don't walk far"
For we're breaking in the new boys, deceive your next of kin
For you're dancing where the dogs decay, defecating ecstasy
You're just an ally of the leecher
Locator for the Virgin King, but I love you in your fuck-me pumps
And your nimble dress that trails
Oh, dress yourself, my urchin one, for I hear them on the rails
Because of all we've seen, because of all we've said
We are the dead

One thing kind of touched me today
I looked at you and counted all the times we had laid
Pressing our love through the night
Knowing it's right, knowing it's right

Now I'm hoping someone will care
Living on the breath of a hope to be shared
Trusting on the sons of our love
That someone will care, someone will care

But now
We're today's scrambled creatures, locked in tomorrow's double feature
Heaven's on the pillow, its silence competes with hell
It's a twenty-four hour service, guaranteed to make you tell
And the streets are full of press men
Bent on getting hung and buried
And the legendary curtains are drawn 'round Baby Bankrupt
Who sucks you while you're sleeping
It's the theatre of financiers
Count them, fifteen 'round a table
White and dressed to kill

Oh caress yourself, my juicy
For my hands have all but withered
Oh dress yourself my urchin one, for I hear them on the stairs
Because of all we've seen, because of all we've said
We are the dead
We are the dead
We are the dead

(Recorded during the Diamond Dogs sessions at the Olympic Studios, Barnes, London SW13 in 1974).





We Prick You

(Lyrics: David Bowie. Music: David Bowie/Brian Eno)

White boys falling on the fires of night
  (I wish you'd tell, I wish you'd tell)
Flesh punks burning in their glue
Revolution comes in the strangest way
  (I wish you'd tell, I wish you'd tell)
I'd rather be inside you

CHORUS 1 (twice)
  Tell the truth
  Tell the truth
  Tell the truth
  We prick you, we prick you, we prick you

CHORUS 2 (twice)
  You show respect even if you disagree
  You show respect

Mama can I kiss you? Daddy can I tell?
  (we wish you well)
Innocence passed me by
I wanna be screwing when the nightmare comes
  (I wish you well, I wish you well)
I wanna come quick and die

CHORUS 1 (twice)
CHORUS 2

All the little rose-kissed foxy girls
  (Shoes, shoes, little white shoes)
Where have all the flowers gone?
All the little fragile champion boys
  (Toys, toys, little black toys)
Dripping on the end of a gun

Even if you disagree

CHORUS 1 (twice)

  You show respect even if you disagree
  You show respect
  You show respect

Shoe, shoe, little white shoe
Wish you well, wish you well
Toy, toy, little black toy
Wish you well, wish you well
Shoe, shoe, little white shoe
Wish you well, wish you well




We Shall Go To Town

(David Bowie/Reeves Gabrels)

No more delight
Or crawling around
Whisper the word
Hold my hand
Never forget
Those who refuse you
Never forget
Who you've been
And you will fight with demons
When we shall go to town
And we'll eat between the rich men
And we'll drink if we don't go down

Follow the lights
Stay on the outside
The only way in
Is swollen with tears
Don't bring your things
Just let me serve you
Only the fool turns around
And you will fight with demons
When we shall go to town
And you will wear your best shoes
And we'll dance if we don't go down
And we'll dance if we don't go down

What'd I Say

(???)

 


(Performed live by Davy Jones and The Manish Boys).





What Kind Of Fool Am I?

(Anthony Newley/Leslie Bricusse)

What kind of fool am I, who never fell in love?
It seems that I'm the only one I have been thinking of
What kind of man is this? An empty shell, a lonely cell
In which an empty heart must dwell?
What kind of lips are these that lied with every kiss?
That whispered empty words of love that left me alone like this?
Why can't I fall in love like any other man?
And maybe then I'll know what kind of fool I am
What kind of clown am I? What do I know of life?
Why can't I cast away the mask of play and live my life?
Why can't I fall in love, till I don't give a damn?
And maybe I'll know what kind of fool I am

(Performed live by David Bowie and The Buzz).





What In The World

 

You're just a little girl with grey eyes
Never mind, say something
Wait until the crowd cries
Oh, wait until the crowd cries
You're just a little girl with grey eyes

So deep in your room, you never leave your room
Something deep inside of me - yearning deep inside of me
Talking through the gloom
What in the world can you do
What in the world can you do
I'm in the mood for your love
For your love
For your love
For your love - oh

I'm just a little bit afraid of you
'Cos love won't make you cry
But, wait until the crowd goes
Oh, wait until the crowd goes
I'm just a little bit afraid of you

So deep in your room, you never leave your room
Something deep inside of me - yearning deep inside of me
Is talking through the gloom
What in the world can I do
What in the world can I do
I'm in the mood for your love
For your love
For your love
For your love

Ohh, what you gonna say?
Ohh, what you gonna do?
Ahh, what you gonna be?
To the real me - to the real me
I'm just a cool
Under the cool, and I'm fighting a wall
What you gonna say to the real me, to the real me?
Ahhhh, ahhhh, ahhhh, ahhhh, ahhhh (fade.)

(Recorded during the Low sessions at The Chateau, Paris, France and Hansa Tonstudio, Berlin, Germany in 1976-1977).





What's Really Happening

(Lyrics: David Bowie / Alex Grant. Music: David Bowie / Reeves Gabrels)

VERSE (x2)
  Grown inside a plastic box
  Micro thoughts and safety locks
  Hearts become outdated clocks
  Ticking in your mind

CHORUS
  What's really happening  What tore us apart
  What's really happening

  What's really happening  What tore us apart
  What's really happening

Now it's time to close our eyes
Now it's time to say goodbye
Now it's time to face the lie
That we'd never cry

CHORUS

All the clouds are made of glass
And they're slowly sinking
Falling like the shattered past
Were we built to last?

CHORUS




When I Live My Dream

 

When I live my dream, I'll take you with me
Riding on a golden horse
We'll live within my castle, with people there to serve you
Happy at the sound of your voice

Maybe, I'll slay a dragon for you
Or banish wicked giants from the land
But you will find, that nothing in my dream can hurt you
We will only love each other as forever
When I live my dream

When I live my dream, I'll forgive the things you've told me
And the empty man you left behind
It's a broken heart that dreams, it's a broken heart you left me
Only love can live in my dream

I'll wish, and the thunder clouds will vanish
Wish, and the storm will fade away
Wish again, and you will stand before me while the sky will paint an overture
And trees will play the rhythm of my dream

When I live my dream, please be there to meet me
Let me be the one to understand
When I live my dream, I'll forget the hurt you gave me
Then we can live in our new land

Till the day my dream cascades around me
I'm content to let you pass me by
Till that day, you'll run to many other men
But let them know it's just for now
Tell them that I've got a dream
And tell them you're the starring role
Tell them I'm a dreaming kind of guy
And I'm going to make my dream
Tell them I will live my dream
Tell them they can laugh at me
But don't forget your date with me
When I live my dream

(German version entitled Mit Mir In Deinem Traum recorded at Trident Studios, Soho, London on 29th January 1969, to be used for an appearance on German television. Part German-English lyrics. Different version also recorded for 'The Looking Glass Murders' production for Scottish TV. Recorded at The Gateway Theatre, Edinburgh, Scotland on 1st February 1970).





When The Wind Blows

(David Bowie/Erdal Kizilcay)

So long child, I'm on my way
And after all is done, after all is done
Don't be down, it's all in the past
Though you may be afraid

So long child, it's awful dark
And I've never felt the sun
I dread to think of when
When the wind blows

When the wind blows (x3)

Life burns a savage wound, angry and wrong
Trusting a twisted word, you'll run, run away
You'll take him home
You'll spit and taunt him
But they won't believe you
No matter what you'll say

So long child, it's awful dark
I never felt the sun
I dread to think of when
When the wind blows

When the wind blows (x3)




When The Boys Come Marching Home

 

How to make amends for the things they said
The girls avoid the stormy skull
But I and my cloudy face
Will be gone, high-tailing out of here
Is the lights a-blazing in their lonely town?
I love the little cars at dawn
But time and my heaving heart
Will be lain upon some foreign shore
Here's the saddest Joe on the corner of the town
"Listen to the words!" he cries
I love him in his craziness, his tatters and his courage
He'll thumb his nose at the straight and true

When the boys come marching home
They'll fly his rags from the highest tree
When the boys come marching home
  (When the boys come marching home)
  (Home, marching home)

Aching for some innocence and peace of mind
While the moon pulls up its net of souls
The sun presses down on my brave new world
But in truth, I don't feel brave at all
Leave it all behind me to the townies and the wags
The kids who never learnt to smile
While I and the cobbled nag I ride
Stumble down another weary mile
Here's to those who cluster
Walking through the wars
The girls who never closed 'til dawn
They rag upon the feeble
And they swan around the stronger
But their eyes are fixed on the edge of town
When the boys come marching home
They'll slide from view - tiny, two by two

When the boys come marching home
  (Home, marching home)
  (Home, marching home)
When the boys come marching home
  (When the boys come marching home)
Boys come marching home
  (Home, marching home)
  (Home, when the boys come marching home)
  (Home, marching home)
  (Home)
  (When the boys come marching home)




Where Have All The Good Times Gone!

(Ray Davies)

In my life I've never stopped to worry about a thing
Opened up and shouted out and never tried to see
Wondering if I'd done wrong
Will this depression last for long?

CHORUS
  Won't you tell me
  Where have all the good times gone
  Where have all the good times gone
  Where have all the good times gone

Once we had an easy ride and always felt the same
Time was on our side and I had everything to gain
Let it be like yesterday
Please let me have happy days

Ma and Pa looked back on all the things they used to do
Didn't have no money and they always told the truth
Daddy didn't have no toys
And Mummy didn't need no boys

CHORUS

Yesterday was such an easy game for you to play
But let's face it things are so much easier today
Guess you need some bringing down
And get your feet back on the ground

CHORUS




White Light/White Heat

(Lou Reed)

VERSE 1
White light - White light gonna drive me out of my brain
White light - White light gonna make me feel so insane
White heat - White shapin' them down to my toes
White light - White light's got it now goodness knows

VERSE 2 White light - White light gonna drive me out of my mind
White light - White light's surely gonna make me blind
White heat - White shaping way down to my toes
White light - White light could kill me now goodness knows

CHORUS
Oh Oh, White light
Oh Oh, White light
Oh Oh, White heat
Oh Oh, White heat

VERSE 1
VERSE 2
CHORUS (x2)

White light's a-flashing

White light
Still feels right
What's that sound, what's that sound
Don't turn on, be dead or alive
No feeling
Here she comes
Oww, yeah
(Oh, oh, oh, oh) here she comes
(Oh, oh, oh, oh)
(Ah, ah, ah, ah)

Shake it, baby, shake...
Shake it, baby, shake...
Shake baby, come on baby shake baby shake

Within You

 

How you turned my world, you precious thing
You starve and near exhaust me
Everything I've done, I've done for you
I move the stars for no one
You've run so long
You've run so far
Your eyes can be so cruel
Just as I can be so cruel
Though I do believe in you
Yes I do
Live without the sunlight
Love without your heartbeat
I, I can't live within you
I can't live within you
(sigh)
I, I can't live within you




Without You I'm Nothing

(Placebo)

Strange infatuation seems to grace the evening tide
I'll take it by your side
Such imagination seems to help the feeling slide
I'll take it by your side
Instant correlation sucks and breeds a pack of lies
I'll take it by your side
Oversaturation curls the skin and tans the hide
I'll take it by your side

Tick - tock (3 times)
Tick - tick - tick - tick - tick - tock - tick

I'm unclean, a libertine
And every time you vent your spleen
I seem to lose the power of speech
You're slipping slowly from my reach
You grow me like an evergreen
You never see the lonely me at all

I...
Take the plan, spin it sideways
I...
Fall
Without you, I'm nothing
Without you, I'm nothing
Without you, I'm nothing
Take the plan, spin it sideways
Without you, I'm nothing at all

(Also performed live with Placebo at The Irving Plaza, New York City on 29th March 1999).





Word On A Wing (1976 Live bonus track)

 

In this age of grand delusion, you walked into my life out of my dreams
I don't need another change, still you forced your way into my scheme of things
You say we're growing, growing heart and soul
In this age of grand delusion, you walked into my life out of my dreams
Oh sweet name, you're born once again for me
Oh sweet name, you're born once again for me
Oh sweet name, I call you again  (you're born once again for me)
Just because I believe don't mean I don't think as well
Don't have to question everything in heaven or hell

CHORUS
  Lord I kneel and offer you, my word on a wing
  And I'm trying hard to fit among your scheme of things
  It's safer than a strange land, though I still care for myself
  And I don't stand in my own light
  Lord, ohh Lord, my prayer flies like a word on a wing
  My prayer flies like a word on a wing
  Does my prayer fit in with your scheme of things?

In this age of grand delusion you walked into my life out of my dream
Oh sweet name, you're born once again for me
Yea' sweet name, you're born once again for me
Just as long as I can see I'll never stop this vision flowing
I look twice and you're still glowing
Just as long as I can walk I'll walk beside you, I'm alive in you
Oh sweet name, you're born once  (you're born once again)
An' I'm ready to shape the scheme of things, oh I'm ready

Ready to shape the scheme of things
Ooh I'm ready, I'm ready, ready
Ohhh I'm ready to shape the scheme of things
Oo I'm ready, ready, ready
Ohhhhh....

Lord I kneel and offer you, my word on a wing
And I'm trying hard to fit among your scheme of things
It's safer than a strange land, though I still care for myself
And I don't stand, in my own light
Oh Lord, Lord, Lord I offer you, my word on a wing
And I'm trying hard to fit among your scheme of things
It's safer than a strange land, though I still care for myself
And I don't stand in my own light
Oh Lord, oh Lord, my prayer flies like a word on a wing
My prayer flies like a word on a wing
Does my prayer fit in with your scheme of things?
Ooooo-ooo-oooo

(Live from Nassau Veterans' Memorial Coliseum, Uniondale, USA, 23rd March 1976).





Yassassin

 

CHORUS
  Yassassin - I'm not a moody guy
  Yassassin - I walk without a sound
  Yassassin - Just a working man, no judge of men
  Yassassin - But such a life I've never known

We came from the farmlands
To live in this city
We walked proud and lustful
In this resonant world
You want to fight
But I don't want to leave
Or drift away

CHORUS

Look at this - no second glances
Look at this - no value of love
Look at this - just sun and steel
Look at this - then look at us

If there's someone in charge
Then listen to me
Don't say nothing's wrong
'Cos I've got a love
And she's afeared
You want to fight
But I don't want to leave
Or drift away

CHORUS

Yassassin, Yassassin, Yassassin



You Can't Sit Down


Hey pretty baby! (you can't sit down)
A don't you hear the drummer thumpin' (you can't sit down)
You gotta shake it like a crazy (you can't sit down)
Because the band is sayin' something (you can't sit down)
And everybody is a jumpin'(you can't sit down)
You gotta slop, bop, flip flop, hip hop
Never stop
(You can't sit down, you can't sit down)

You gotta move, move, move, a round and round (1)
(You can't sit down, you can't sit down)
You gotta fly, fly, fly, way off the ground
You're puttin' down, a crazy, shout
No, no, you can't sit down, no, no, you can't sit down

When you're on South Street (you can't sit down)
And the band is really bootin' (you can't sit down)
You hear the hip beat with the back beat (you can't sit down)
And you see the gang a groovin' (you can't sit down)
You gotta get your bottom movin' (you can't sit down)
You gotta make it, break it, shake it all around
You can't sit down, you can't sit down


You can't sit down, you can't sit down, you can't sit down
You can't sit down, you can't sit down, you can't sit down
You can't sit down, you can't sit down, you movin' em down
A crazy shout, you can't sit down

A, yea, yea, yea, hey pretty baby
You know you really dance so fine now
You're really shakin' like a crazy
A don't you down lead the line now
We're gonna do it one more time now
You got to make it, break it, shake it, all around
(You can't sit down, you can't sit down)


(You can't sit down, you can't sit down)
You gotta move, move, move, a round and round
(You can't sit down, you can't sit down)
You gotta fly, fly, fly, way off the ground


You Got To Have A Job (If You Don't Work - You Can't Eat) / Hot Pants

They say you got to get a job
To put meat on the table
You got to get a job
To keep your family able

They say you got to get a job
To put shoes on your feet
You got to get a job
To make your life complete

You don't work, you can't eat
You don't work, you can't eat
You don't work, you can't eat
You don't work, you can't eat

REEL AROUND THE FOUNTAIN

It's time the tale was told
of how you took a child
and you made him old
Reel around the fountain
slap me on the patio
I'll take it now
Fifteen minutes with you
well, I wouldn't say no
people said that you were virtually dead
and they were so wrong
fifteen minutes with you
well, i wouldn't say no
people said that you were easily led
and they were half-right
I dreamt about you last night
and i fell out of bed twice
you can pin and mount me like a butterfly
but take me to the haven of your bed
was something that you never said
two lumps, please
you're the bee's knees
but so am I
Meet me at the fountain
shove me on the patio
I'll take it slowly
Fifteen minutes with you
oh I wouldn't say no
people see no worth in you
oh but I do

 

YOU'VE GOT EVERYTHING NOW

As merry as the days were long
I was right and you were wrong
back at the old grey school
I would win and you would lose
But you've got everything now
and what a terrible mess I've made of my life
No, I've never had a job
because I've never wanted one
I've seen you smile
but I've never really heard you laugh
So who is rich and who is poor?
I cannot say...
You are your mother's only son
and you're a desperate one
But I don't want a lover
I just want to be seen in the back of your car
A friendship sadly lost?
Well, this is true ...and yet, it's false
Did I ever tell you , by the way
I never did like your face
But you've got everything now
and what a terrible mess I've made of my life
No, I've never had a job
because I'm too shy
But I don't want a lover
I just want to be tied to the back of your car.

 

MISERABLE LIE

So, goodbye
please stay with your own kind
and I'll stay with mine
There's something against us
it's not time
So, goodbye
I know I hardly say
how much I love your casual way
but please put your tongue away
a little higher and we're well away
the dark nights are drawing in
and your humour is as black as them
I look at yours, you laugh at mine
and"love" is just a miserable lie
you have destroyed my flower like-life
not once-but twice
you have corrupt my innocent mind
not once-but twice
I know that wind-swept mystical air
it means: I'd like to see your underwear
I recognise that mystical air
it means: I'd like to see your underwear
what do we get for the trouble and pain?
just a rented room in Whalley Range
into the depths of the criminal world
I followed her...
I need advice, I need advice
because nobody ever looks at me twice
I'm just a country-mile behind
the world
I'm just a country mile behind
the whole world
so take me when you go

 

PRETTY GIRLS MAKE GRAVES

Upon the sand,upon the bay
"there is a quick and easy way" you say
before you illustrate
I'd rather state:
"I'm not the man you think I am
I'm not the man you think I am "
And Sorrow's native son
he will not smile for anyone
And pretty girls makes the graves
End of the pier, end of the bay
you tug my arm and say:"Give into lust,
give up to lust, oh heaven knows we'll
soon be dust..."
But I'm not the man you think I am
I'm not the man you think I am
And Sorrow's native son
he will not rise for anyone
And pretty girls make graves
I could have been wild and I could have been free
but Nature played this trick on me
She wants it Now
and she will not wait
but she's too rough
and I'm too delicate
Then on the sand
another man, he takes her hand
and a smile lights up her stupid face
(and well, it would)
I lost my faith in Womanhood
I lost my faith in Womanhood, I lost my faith

 

THE HAND THAT ROCKS THE CRADLE

Please don't cry
the ghost and the storm outside
will not invade this sacred shire
nor infiltrate your mind
my life down I shall lie
if the bogey-man should try
to play tricks on your sacred mind
to tease, torment and tantalise
wavering shadows loom
a piano plays in an empty room
there'll be blood on the cleaver tonight
when darkness lifts and the room is bright
I'll still be by your side
for you are all that matters
and I'll love you till the day I die
there never need to be longing in your eyes
as long as the hand that rocks the cradle is mine
ceiling shadows shimmy by
and when the wardrobe towers like a beast of prey
there's a sadness in your beautiful eyes
you're untouched, unsoiled, wonderous eyes
my life down I shall lie
should restless spirts try
to play tricks on you sacred mind
but whom I never gave a name
I just looked into his wonderous eyes
and said" never never never again"
all too soon I did return
just like a moth to a flame
so rattle my bones all over the stones
because I'm only a beggar-man whom nobody owns
see how words as old as sin
fit me like a glove I'm here and here I'll stay
together we lie, together we pray
there never need be longing in your eyes
as long as the hand that rocks the cradle is mine

 

STILL ILL

I decree today that life
is simply taking and not giving
England is mine and it owes me a living
ask me why, and I'll spit in your eye
ask me why, and I'll spit in your eye
but we cannot cling to the old dreams anymore
no, we cannot cling to the old dreams anymore
Does the body rule the mind
or does the mind rule the body?
I dunno...
Under the iron bridge we kissed
and although I ended up with sore lips
it just wasn't like the old days anymore
no, it wasn't like those days
am I still ill?
Does the body rule the mind
or does the mind rule the body ?
I dunno...
Ask me why, and I'll die
ask me why, and I'll die
and if you must go to work tomorrow
well, if I were you I wouldn't bother
for there are brighter sides to life
and I should know because I've seen them
but not very often...
under the iron bridge we kissed
and although I ended up with sore lips
it just wasn't like the old days anymore
no, it wasn't like those days
am I still ill?

 

HAND IN GLOVE

Hand in glove
the sun shines out of our behinds
no, it's not like any other love
this one is different-because it's us
Hand in glove
we can go wherever we please
and everything depends upon
how near you stand to me
And if the people stare
then the people stare
I really don't know and I really don't care
Hand in glove
the Good People laugh
yes, we may be hidden by rags
but we have something they'll never have
So, hand in glove I stake my claim
I'll fight to the last breath
If they dare touch a hair on your head
I'll fight to the last breath
The Good Life is out there, somewhere
so stay on my arm, you little charmer
But I know my luck too well
and I'll probably never see you again.

 

WHAT DIFFERENCE DOES IT MAKE?

All men have secrets and here is mine
so let it be known
we have been through hell and high tide,
I can surely rely on you?
and yet you start to recoil,
heavy words are so lightly thrown
but still I'd leap in front of a flying bullet for you
So, what difference does it make?
so, what difference does it make?
it makes none
but you have gone
and you must be looking very old tonight
The devil will find work for idle hands to do
I stole and I lied, and why?
because you asked me to!
but now you make feel so ashamed
because I've only got two hands
well, I'm still fond of you
So, what difference does it make?
so, what difference does it make?
it makes none
but you have gone
and your prejudice won't keep you warm tonight
So, no more apologies
no more apologies
I'm too tired
I'm too sick and tired
and I'm feeling very sick and ill today
But I'm still fond of you

 

I DON'T OWE YOU ANYTHING

Bought on stolen wine
a nod was the first step
you know very well
what was coming next
did I really walk all this way
just to hear you say
"oh I don't want to go out tonight"
but you will
for you must
I don't owe you anything
but you owe me something
repay me now
you should never go to them
let them come to you
just like I do
you should not go to them
let them come to you
just like I do
Too freely on your lips
words prematurely said
oh but I know what will make you smile tonight
Life is never kind
life is never kind
oh but I know what will make you smile tonight

 

SUFFER LITTLE CHILDREN

Over the moors,take me to the moors
dig a shallow grave
and I'll lay me down
Lesley-Anne, with your pretty white beads
oh John, you'll never be a man
and you'll never see your home again
oh Manchester, so much to answer for
Edward, see those alluring lights?
tonight will be your very last night
a woman said "I know my son is dead
I'll never rest my hands on his scared head"
Hindley wakes and Hindley says:
"Wherever he has gone, I have gone "
But fresh lilaced moorland fields
cannot hide the stoild stench of death
Hindley wakes and Hindley says:
"Whatever he has done, I have done"
But this is no easy ride
for a child cries
"find me...find me, nothing more
we're on a sullen misty moor
we may be dead and we may be gone
but we will be right by your side
until the day you die
this is no easy ride
we will haunt you when you laugh
yes, you could say we're a team
you might sleep
BUT YOU WILL NEVER DREAM!"
Oh Manchester, so much to answer for
Oh Manchester, so much to answer for
Over the moor, I'm on the moor
the child is on the moor

 

THE HEADMASTER RITUAL

Belligerent ghouls
run Manchester schools
spineless swines
cemented mines
Sir leads the troops
jealous of youth
same old suit since 1962
he does the military two-step
down the nape of my neck
I wanna go home
I don't want to stay
give up education
is a bad mistake
mid-week on the playing fields
Sir thwacks you on the knees
knees you in the groin
elbow in the face
I wanna go home
I don't want to stay
Belligerent ghouls
run Manchester schools
spineless bastards all
Sir leads the troops
jealous of youth
same old jokes since 1902
he does the military two-step
down the nape of my neck
I wanna go home
I don't want to stay
give up life
as a bad mistake
please excuse me from gym
I've got this terrible cold coming on
he grabs and devours
he kicks me in the showers
kicks me in the showers
and he grabs and devours
I wanna go home
I don't want to stay

 

RUSHOLME RUFFIANS

The last night at the fair
by the big wheel generator
a boy is stabbed
and his money is grabbed
and the air hangs heavy like a dulling wine
she is famous
she is funny
an engagement ring
doesn't mean a thing
to a mind consumed by brass(money)
and though I walk home alone
my faith in love is still devout
the last night at the fair
from a seat on a whirling waltzer
her skirt ascends for a watching eye
it's a hideous trait( on her mother's side)
and though I walk home alone
my faith in love is still devout
then someone falls in love
and someone's beaten up
and the senses being dulled are mine
and someone falls in love
someone's beaten up
and the senses being dulled are mine
and though I walk home alone
my faith in love is still devout
this is the last night of the fair
and the grease in the hair
of a speedway operator
is all a tremulous heart requires
a schoolgirl is denied
she said "How quickly would I die
if I jumped from the top of the parachutes?"
this is the last night of the fair
and the grease in the hair
of a speedway operator

scratch my name on your arm with a fountain pen
(this means you really love me)

I WANT THE ONE I CAN'T HAVE

On the day that your mentality
catches up with your biology
I want the one I can't have
and it's driving me mad
it's written all over my face
A double-bed
and a stalwart lover, for sure
these are the riches of the poor
A double-bed
and a stalwart lover, for sure
these are the riches of the poor
a tough kid who sometimes swallows nails
raised on Prisoner's Aid
he killed a policeman when he was thirteen
and somehow that really impressed me
it's written all over my face
On the day that your mentality
catches up with your biology
And if you ever need self-validation
just meet me in the alley by the
railway-station
it's written all over my face

 

WHAT SHE SAID

What she said:
"How come someone hasn't noticed
that I'm dead
and decided to bury me
God knows, I'm ready"
What she said was
but then, all the rejection she's had
to pretend to be happy
could only be idiocy
What she said was not for the job or
lover that she never had
What she read
all heady books
she'd sit and prophesise
(it took a tattoed boy from Birkenhead
to really really open her eyes)

THAT JOKE ISN'T FUNNY ANYMORE

Park the car at the side of the road
you should know
time's tide will smother you
and I will too
when you laugh about other people who feel so
very lonely
their only desire is to die
well I'm afraid
it doesn't make me smile
I wish I could laugh
but that joke isn't funny anymore
it's too close to home and it's too near the bone
it's too close to home and it's too near the bone
more than you'll ever know
It was dark as I drove the point home
and on cold leather seats
well, it suddenly struck me
I just might die with a smile on my
face after all
I've seen this happen in other people's lives
and now it's happening in mine

 

NOWHERE FAST

I'd like to drop my trousers to the world
I am a man of means(of slender means)
each household appliance
is like a new science in my town
and if a day came when I felt a natural emotion
I'd get such a shock I'd probably jump in the ocean
and when a train goes by
it's such a sad sound
I'd like to drop my trousers to the Queen
every sensible child will know what this means
the poor and the needy
are selfish and greedy on her terms
and if the day came when I felt a natural emotion
I'd get such a shock I'd probably jump in the ocean
and when a train goes by
it's such a sad song
And when I'm lying in my bed
I think about life
and I think about death
and neither one particularly appeals to me
and if the day came when I felt a natural emotion
I'd get such a shock I'd probably lie
in the middle of the street and die
I'd lie down and die

 

WELL I WONDER

Well I wonder
do you hear me when you sleep?
I hoarsely cry
Well I wonder
do you see me when we pass?
I half-die
Please keep me in mind
please keep me in mind
Gasping-but somehow still alive
this is the fierce last stand of all I am
Gasping-dying-but somehow still alive
this is the final stand of all I am
Please keep me in mind

 

BARBARISM BEGINS AT HOME

Unruly boys
who will not grow up
must be taken in hand
Unruly girls
who will not settle down
they must be taken in hand
A crack on the head
is what you get for not asking
and a crack on the head
is what you get for asking

 

MEAT IS MURDER

Heifer whines could be human cries
closer comes the screaming knife
this beautiful creature must die
this beautiful creature must die
a death for no reason
and death for reason is MURDER
and the flesh you so fancifully fry
is not succulent, tasty or nice
it's death for no reason
and death for no reason is MURDER
and the calf that you carve with a smile
is MURDER
and the turkey you festively slice
is MURDER
do you know how animals die?
kitchen aroma aren't very homely
it's not "comforting," "cheery" or kind
it's sizzling blood and the unholy stench
of MURDER
it's not "natural," "normal" or kind
the fleas you so fancifully fry
as you savour the flavour
of MURDER
NO, NO, NO, IT'S MURDER
NO, NO, NO, IT'S MURDER
who hears when animals cry?

 

THE QUEEN IS DEAD

Farewell to this lands cheerless marches
hemmed in like a boar between arches
her very Lowness with her head in a sling
Im truely sorry-but it sounds like a wonderful thing
dear Charles, dont you ever crave
to appear on the front of the Daily mail
dressed in your Mother's bridal veil?
So, I checked all the registered historical facts
and I was shocked into shame to discover
how Im the 18th pale descendent
of some, old queen or other
has the world changed, or have I changed?
has the world changed, or have I changed?
as some 9-year old tough peddles drugs
(I never even knew what drugs were)
And so, I broke into the Palace
with a sponge and a rusty spanner
she said: "Eh, I know you, and you cannot sing"
I said: "that's nothing -you should hear me play piano"
We can go for a walk where it's quiet and dry
and we can talk about precious things
but when you are tied to your mother's apron
not one talks about castration
We can go for a walk where it's quiet and dry
and we can talk about precious things
like love and law and poverty
these are the things that kill me
We can go for a walk where it's quiet and dry
and we can talk about precious things
but the rain that flattens my hair
theses are the things that kill me
Passed the Pub that saps your body
and the church who'll snatch your money
the Queen is dead, boys
and it's so lonely on a limb
Pass the Pub that wrecks your body
and the church-all they want is your money
the Queen is dead, boys`
you can trust me, boys
life is very long, when you're lonely
life is very long, when you're lonely...

 

FRANKLY MR.SHANKLY

Frankly, Mr Shankly, this position Ive held
it pays my way, but it corrodes my soul
I want to leave you will not miss me
I want to go down in musical history
Frankly, Mr Shankly, Im a sickening wreck
Ive got the 21st Century breathing down my neck
I must move fast, you understand me
I want to go down in celluloid history
Fame, Fame, fatal Fame
it can play hideous tricks on the brain
but still I rather be Famous
than righteous or holy, any day
but sometimes Id feel more fulfilled
making Christmas cards with the mentally ill
I want to Live and I want to Love
I want to catch something that I might be ashamed of
Frankly, Mr Shankly, this position I've held
it pays my way and it corrodes my soul
oh, I didnt realise that you wrote poetry
(I didnt realise you wrote such bloody awful poetry)
Frankly, Mr Shankly, since you ask
you are a flatulent pain the arse
I do not mean to be so rude
but still, I must speck frankly, Mr Shankly

 

I KNOW IT'S ALL OVER

Oh Mother, I can fell the soil falling over my head
and as i climb into an empty bed
Oh well, Enough said
I know it's over-still I cling
I don't know where else I can go
Oh Mother, I can feel the soil falling over my head
see, the sea want s to take me
the knife wants to cut me
do you think you can help me?
Sad veiled bride, please be happy
handsome groom, give her room
loud, loutish lover, treat her kindly
(although she needs you
more than she loves you)
and I know it's over
and it never really began
but in my heart it was so real
and you even spoke to me and said:
"If you're so funny
then why are you on your own tonight?
and if you are so clever
then why are you on your own tonight?
if you're so terribly good looking
then why do you sleep alone tonight?
because tonight is just like any other night
that's why you're on your own tonight
with your triumphs and your charms
while they are in each other's arms.."
It's so easy to laugh
it's so easy to hate
it takes strength to be gentle and kind
It's so easy to laugh
it's so easy to hate
it takes guts to be gentle and kind
love is Natural and Real
but not for you, my love
not tonight my love
love is Natural and Real
but not for such as you and I, my love
Oh Mother, I can fell the soil falling over my head
Oh Mother, I can fell the soil falling over my head...

 

NEVER HAD NO ONE EVER

When you walk without ease
on these
the very streets where you were raised
I had a really bad dream
it lasted 20 years, 7 months, and 27 days
Never had no one ever.

 

CEMETERY GATES

A dreaded sunny day
so I meet you at the cemetry gates
Keats and Yeats are on your side
A dreaded sunny day
so I meet you at the cemetry gates
Keats and Yeats are on your side
while Wilde is on mine
So we go inside and we gravely read the stones
all those people all those lives
where are they now ?
with loves, and hates
and passions just like mine
they were born
and then they lived and then they died
which seems so unfair
and I wantr to crv
You say: "ere thrice the sun hath done salutation to the dawn"
and you claim these words as your own
but Im well-read, have heard them said
a hundred times (maybe less, maybe more)
if you must write prose/poems
the words you use should be your own
dont plagiarise or take "on loans"
there's alweays someone, somewhere
with a big nose, who knows
and who trips you up and laughs
when you fall
You say: "ere long done do does did "
words which could only be your own
you then produce the text
from whence was ripped
(some dizzy whore, 1804)
A dreaded sunny day
so let's go where we're happy
so I meet you at the cemetry gates
Keats and Yeats are on your side
A dreaded sunny day
so let's go where we're wanted
so I meet you at the cemetry gates
Keats and Yeats are on your side
but you lose
because Wilde is on mine

 

BIGMOUTH STRIKES AGAIN

Sweetness, sweetness I was only joking
when I said Id like to smash every tooth
in your head
Sweetness, sweetness I was only joking
when I said by right s you should be
bludgeoned in your bed
and now I know how Joan of Arc felt
now I know how Joan of Arc felt
as the flames roseto her roman nose
and her Walkman stared to melt
Bibmouth, bigmouth
bigmouth strikes again
and Ive got no right to take my place
with the Human race
and now I know how Joan of Arc felt
now I know of Joan of Arc felt
as the flames rose to her roman nose
and her hearing aid started to melt
Bigmouth, bigmouth
bigmouth strikes again
and Ive got no right to take my place

THE BOY WITH A THORN IN HIS SIDE

The boy with the thorn in his side
behind the hatred there lies
a murderous desire for love
how can they look into my eyes
and still they dont believe me
how can they hear me say those words
and still they dont believe me
and if they don't believe me now
will they ever believe me?
and if they don't believe me now
will they ever believe me?
The boy with the thorn in his side
behind the hatred there lies
a plundering desire for love
how can they see the Love in our eyes
and still they don't believe us
and after all this time
they don't want to believe us
and if they dont believe us now
will they ever believe us ?
andd when you want to Live
how do you start ?
where do you go ?
who do you know?

 

VICAR IN A TUTU

I was minding mind business
lifting some lead off
the roof of the Holy Name church
it was worthwhile living a laughable life
just to set my eyes on a blistering sight
of a vicar in a tu-tu
he's not strange
he just wants to live his life this way
a scanty bit of a thing
with a decorative ring
that wouldn't cover the head of a child
as Rose collects the money in the cannister
who comes sliding down the bannister
the vicar in a tu-tu
he's not strange
he just wants to live his life this way
the monkish monsignor
with a head full of plaster
said "my man, get your vile soul dry-cleaned"
as Rose counts the money in the cannister
as natural as rain
he dances again
vicar in a tu-tu
The next day in the pulpit
with Freedom and Ease
combating ignoranca,dust and disease
as Rose counts the money in the cannister
as natural as rain
he dances again
the fabric of a tu-tu
any man could get us to
and I am a living sign.

 

THERE IS A LIGHT THAT NEVER GOES OUT

Take me out tonight
where there's music and there's people
who are young and alive
driving in your car
I never never want to go home
because I havent got one
anymore
take me out tonight
because I want to see people and I
want to see lights
driving in your car
oh please dont drop me home
because it's not my home, it's their
home, and Im welcome no morw
and if a double-decker bus
crashes in to us
to die by your side
such a heavenly way to die
and if a ten ton truck
kills the both of us
to die by your side
the pleasure and the privilege is mine
take me out tonight
oh take me anywhere, I dont care
and in the darken underpass
I thought Oh God, my chance has come at last
(but then a strange fear gripped me and I just couldn't ask)
take me out tonight
take me anywhere, I dont care
just driving in your car
I never never want to go home
because I havent got one
I havent got one.

 

SOME GIRLS ARE BIGGER THAN OTHERS

From the ice-age to the dole-age
there is but one concern
and I have just discover
some girls are bigger than others
some girls are bigger than others
some girls mothers are bigger than
other girls mothers
As Anthony said to Cleopatra
as he opened a crate of ale:
some girls are bigger than others
some girls are bigger than others
some girls mothers are bigger than
other girls mothers.

 

A RUSH AND A PUSH AND AND THE LAND IS OURS

HELLO
I am the ghost of Troubled Joe
hung by his pretty white neck
some eighteen months ago
I travelled to a mystical time zone
but I missed my bed
so I soon came home
they said:
"there's too much caffeine
in your bloodstream
and a lack of real spice
in your life"
I said:
"leave me alone
because I'm alright, dad
just surprised to still
be on my own...."
Ooh, but don't mention love
I'd hate the real strain of the pain again
a rush and a push and the land that
we stand on is ours
it has been before
so it shall be again
and people who are uglier than you and I
they take what they need, and leave
Ooh, but don't mention love
I'd hate the pain and the strain all over again
a rush and a push and the land that
we stand on is ours
it has been before
so why can't it be now?
and people who are weaker than you and I
they take what they want from life
Ooh, but don't mention love
no - just don't mention love!
a rush and a push and the land that
we stand on is ours
your youth may be gone
but you're still a young man
so phone me, phone me, phone me
so phone me, phone me, phone me
Ooh, I think I'm in love...
Urrgh, I think I'm in lerv

 

I STARTED SOMETHING I COULDN'T FINISH

The lanes were silent
with nothing or no one around for miles
I doused our friendly venture
with a hard-faced
three-word gesture
I started something
I forced you into a zone
and you were clearly
never meant to go
hair brushed and parted
typical me, typical me, typical me
I started something
...and now I'm not too sure
I grabbed you by the guilded beams
that's what Tradition means
and I doused another venture
with a gesture
that was...absolutely vile
I started something
forced you to a zone
and you were clearly
never meant to go
hair brushed and parted
typical me, typical me, typical me
I started something
...and now I'm not too sure
I grabbed you by the guilded beams
that's what Tradition means
and now eighteen months' hard-labour
seems...fair enough
I started something
forced you to a zone
and you were clearly
never meant to go
hair brushed and parted
typical me, typical me, typical me
I started something
and now I'm not too sure

 

DEATH OF A DISCO DANCER

The death of a disco dancer
well, it happens a lot 'round here
and if you think Peace
is a common goal
well, that goes to show
just how little you know
The death of a disco dancer
well, I'd rather not get involved
I never talk to my neighbour
I'd just rather not get involved
Love, peace and harmony?
Love, peace and harmony?
Oh, very nice, very nice, very nice, very nice
...but maybe in the next world.

 

GIRLFRIEND IN A COMA

Girlfriend in a coma, I know
I know - it's serious
Girlfriend in a coma, I know
I know - it's really serious
there wree times when I could
have 'murdered' her
(but, you know, I would hate
anything to happen to her)
NO, I DON'T WANT TO SEE HER
Do you really think
she'll pull through?
Do you really think
she'll pull through?
Girlfriend in a coma, I know
I know, it's serious
there were time when I could
have 'strangeled' her
(but, you know, I would hate
anything to happen to her)
WOULD YOU PLEASE LET ME SEE HER!
Do you really think she'll pull through?
Do you really think she'll pull through?
Let me wisper my last goodbyes
I know - IT'S SERIOUS

 

STOP ME IF YOU'VE HEARD THIS ONE BEFORE

Stop me, stop me,
stop me if you think that you've heard this one before
stop me, stop me
stop me if you think that you've heard this one before
nothing's changed
I still love you, oh I still love you
...only slightly less than I used to
I was delayed, I was way-laid
an emergency stop
I smelt the last ten seconds of life
I crashed down on the crossbar
and the pain was enough to make
a shy, bald buddhist reflect
and plan a mass-murder
who said I'd lied to her?
who said I'd lied because I never
who said I'd lied because I never
I was detained, I was restrained
he broke my spleen
he broke my knees
(and then he really laid into me)
Friday night in Out-patients
who said I'd lied to her?
who said I'd lied - because I never
who said I'd lied - because I never
Oh, so I drank one
or was it four
and when I fell on the floor
...I drank more
stop me, stop me
stop me if you think that you've heard this one before
nothing's changed
I still love you, I still love you
but only slightly
less than I used to

 

LAST NIGHT I DREAMT THAT SOMEBODY LOVED ME

Last night I dreamt
that somebody loved me
no hope - but no harm
just another false alarm
Las night I felt
real arms around me
no hope - no harm
just another false alarm
so, tell me how long
before the last one?
and tell me how long
before the right one?
this story is old - I KNOW
but it goes on
this story is old - I KNOW
but it goes on

 

UNHAPPY BIRTHDAY

I've come to wish you an unhappy birthday
I've come to wish you an unhappy birthday
because you're evil
and you lie
and if you should die
I may feel slightly sad
(but I won't cry)
Loved and lost
and some may say
when usually its Nothing
surely you're happy
it should be this way?
I say "No, I'm gonna kill my dog"
and: "May the lines sag heavy
and deep tonight XXX"
I've come to wish you an unhappy birthday
I've come to wish you an unhappy birthday
because you're evil
and you lie
and if you should die
I may feel slightly sad
(But I won't cry)
Loved and lost
some people say
when usually its Nothing
surely you're happy
it should be this way?
I said "No"
and then I shot myself
so, drink, drink, drink
and be ill tonight
from the one you left behind
from the one you left behind...

 

PAINT A VULGAR PICTURE

At the record company meeting
On their hands - a dead star
and ooh, the plans that they weave
and ooh, the sikening greed
At the record company meeting
on their hands - a dead star
the sycophantic slags all say:
"I knew him first, and I knew him well"
Re-issue! Re-package! Re-package!
Re-evaluate the songs
double-pack with a photograph
Extra Track (and a tacky badge)
A-list, playlist
"Please them, please them!"
"Please them! Please them!"
(sadly, THIS was your life)
but you could have said no
if you'd wanted to
you could have said no
if you'd wanted to
BPI, MTV, BBC
"Please them! Please them!"
(sadly this was your life)
but you could have said no
if you'd wanted to
you could have walked away
...couldn't you?
I touched you at the soundcheck
you had no real way of knowing
in my heart I bgged "please, take
me with you...
I don't care where you're going"
But to you I was faceless
I was fawning, I was boring
just a child from those ugly new houses
who could never begin to know
who could never really know
Best of? Most of?
Satiate the need
slip them into different sleeves!
Buy both, and be decieved
climber - new entry, re-entry
World tour! ("media whore")
"Please the Press in Belgium!"
(THIS was your life...)
and when it fails to recoup?
Well, maybe:
You just haven't earned it yet, baby
I walked a pace behind you at the soundcheck
you're just the same as I am
what makes most people feel happy
leads us headlong into harm
so, in my bedroom in those 'ugly new houses'
I dance my legs down to the knees
but me and my 'true love'
we will never meet again...
At the record company meeting
on their hands - at last! - a dead star!
but they cannot taint you in my eyes
no, they cannout touch you now
No, they cannot hurt you my darling
they cannot touch you now
but me and my 'true love'
will never meet again

 

DEATH AT ONE'S ELBOW

Ooh Glenn, don't come to the house tonight
Ooh, Glenn, don't come to the house tonight
because there's somebody here
who really really loves you
stay home
be bored
(it's crap, I KNOW)
Ooh, Glenn, don't come to the house tonight
Ooh, Glen, don't come to the house tonight
because there's somebody here
who'll take a hatchet to your ear
how the frustration renders me
hateful, Glenn!
don't come to the house tonight
don't come to the house tonight
because you'll slip on the
trail of my bespattered remains
and so, that's why
GOODBYE MY LOVE, GOODBYE MY LOVE, GOODBYE MY LOVE...
Belch

 

I WON'T SHARE YOU

I won't share you
I won't share you
with the drive and ambition
and the zeal I feel
this is my time
as the note I wrote
was read, she said
has the Perrier gone
straight to my head
or is life plainly sick and cruel, instead?
"YES!"
No-no-no-no-no-no
I won't share you
I won't share you
with the drive and the dreams inside
this is my time
Life tends to come and go
well, that's OK
just as long as you know
Life tends to come and go
well, that's OK
just as long as you know
I won't share you
I won't share you
with the drive and the dreams inside
this is my time, this is my time


THE QUEEN IS DEAD

Farewell to this lands cheerless marches
hemmed in like a boar between arches
her very Lowness with her head in a sling
Im truely sorry-but it sounds like a wonderful thing
dear Charles, dont you ever crave
to appear on the front of the Daily mail
dressed in your Mother's bridal veil?
So, I checked all the registered historical facts
and I was shocked into shame to discover
how Im the 18th pale descendent
of some, old queen or other
has the world changed, or have I changed?
has the world changed, or have I changed?
as some 9-year old tough peddles drugs
(I never even knew what drugs were)
And so, I broke into the Palace
with a sponge and a rusty spanner
she said: "Eh, I know you, and you cannot sing"
I said: "that's nothing -you should hear me play piano"
We can go for a walk where it's quiet and dry
and we can talk about precious things
but when you are tied to your mother's apron
not one talks about castration
We can go for a walk where it's quiet and dry
and we can talk about precious things
like love and law and poverty
these are the things that kill me
We can go for a walk where it's quiet and dry
and we can talk about precious things
but the rain that flattens my hair
theses are the things that kill me
Passed the Pub that saps your body
and the church who'll snatch your money
the Queen is dead, boys
and it's so lonely on a limb
Pass the Pub that wrecks your body
and the church-all they want is your money
the Queen is dead, boys`
you can trust me, boys
life is very long, when you're lonely
life is very long, when you're lonely...

 

PANIC

Panic on the streets of London
Panic on the streets of Birmingham
I wonder to myself
Could life ever be sane again
on the Leeds side-streets that you slip down
I wonder to myself
Hopes may rise on the Grasmeres
But Honey Pie, you're not safe here
So you run down
To the safety of the town
But there's Panic on the streets of Carlisle
Dublin, Dundee, Humberside
I wonder to myself
Burn down the Disco
Hang the blessed D.J.
Because the music that they constantly play
IT SAYS NOTHING TO ME ABOUT MY LIFE
Hang the blessed D.J.
Because the music they constantly play
On the Leeds side-streets that you slip down
On the provincial towns that you jog 'round
Hang the D.J.,. Hang the D.J.,.Hang the D.J...

ASK

Shyness is nice, but
Shyness can stop you
From doing all the things in life
That you'd like to
So, if there's something you'd like to try
ASK ME-I WON'T SAY "NO"-HOW COULD I?
Coyness is nice, but ,
Coyness can stop you
from saying all the things in
life that you want to
If there's something that you'd like to try
ASK ME-I WON'TSAY"NO"-HOW COULD I?
Spending warm, Summer days indoors
Writing fringhtening verse
To a buck-toothed girl in Luxembourg
ASK ME, ASK ME ,ASK ME, ASK ME, ASK ME ,ASK ME
Because if it's not Love
Then it's the Bomb
That will bring us together
Nature is a language-can't you read?
Nature is a language-can't you read?
ASK ME, ASK ME ,ASK ME, ASK ME, ASK ME ,ASK ME

MARIE'S THE NAME (HIS LATEST FLAME) / RUSHOLME RUFFIANS

Very old friend 
Came by today 
As he was telling everyone in town 
Of all the love that he'd just found 
And Marie's the name (of his latest flame) 
Talked and talked 
And I heard him say 
That she had the longest blackest hair 
Prettiest green eyes anywhere 
And Marie's the name (of his latest flame) 
The last night of the fair 
By the big wheel generator 
A boy is stabbed 
His money is grabbed 
And the air hangs heavy like a dulling wine 
She is Famous 
She is Funny 
An engagement ring 
Doesn't mean a thing 
To a mind consumed by brass (money), oh 
The last night of the fair 
From a seat on a whirling waltzer 
Her skirt ascends for a watching eye 
It's a hideous trait (on her mother's side)
From a seat on a whirling waltzer 
Her skirt ascends for a watching eye 
A hideous trait (on her mother's side) 
Then someone falls in love 
Someone's beaten up 
Someone's beaten up 
And the senses being dulled are mine 
And someone falls in love 
Someone's beaten up 
And the senses being dulled are mine 
This is the last night of the fair 
And the grease in the hair 
Of a speedway operator 
Is all a tremulous heart requires 
A schoolgirl is denied 
She said : "How quickly would I die 
If I jumped from the top of the parachutes ?"
This is the last night of the fair 
And the grease in the hair 
Of a speedway operator 
Is all a tremulous heart requires 
A schoolgirl is denied 
She said : "How quickly would I die 
Oh, if I jumped from the top of the parachutes ?"
...Oh, walk home alone 
I might walk home alone 
But my faith in love is still devout

 

THE BOY WITH THE THORN IN HIS SIDE

The boy with the thorn in his side

RUBBER RING / WHAT SHE SAID

Yeah! What she says : 
"How come someone hasn't noticed 
That I'm dead 
And decided to bury me ? 
God knows, I'm ready !"
La-la-la ... 
What she said was sad 
But then, all the rejection she's had 
To pretend to be happy 
Could only be idiocy 
La-la-la ... 
What she said was not for the job or 
Lover that she never had 
No no no ... 
What she read 
All heady books 
She'd sit and prophesise 
(It took a tattooed boy from 
Birkenhead 
To really really open her eyes)

AND I NEED TO CLING TO SOMETHING !"

IS IT REALLY SO STRANGE?

I left the North 
I travelled South 
I found a tiny house 
And I can't help the way I feel 
Oh yes, you can kick me 
And you can punch me 
And you can break my face 
But you won't change the way I feel 
'Cause I love you, Oh ... 
And is it really so strange ? 
Oh, is it really so strange ? 
Oh, is it really so, really so strange ? 
I say NO, you say YES 
(and you will change your mind) 
I left the South 
I travelled North 
I got confused - I killed a horse 
I can't help the way I feel 
Oh yes, you can punch me 
And you can butt me 
And you can break my spine 
But you won't change the way I feel 
'Cause I love you, Oh ... 
And is it really so strange ? 
Oh, is it really so strange ? 
Oh, is it really so, really so strange ? 
I say NO, you say YES 
(But you will change your mind) 
I left the North again 
I travelled South again 
And I got confused - I killed a nun 
I CAN'T HELP THE WAY I FEEL 
(I lost my bag in Newport Pagnell) 
Why is the last mile the hardest mile ? 
My throat was dry, with the sun in my eyes 
And I realised, I realised 
I could never 
I could never, never, never, go back home again

 

CEMETERY GATES

A dreaded sunny day

Keats and Yeats are on your side
A dreaded sunny day
so I meet you at the cemetry gates
Keats and Yeats are on your side
while Wilde is on mine
So we go inside and we gravely read the stones
all those people all those lives
where are they now ?
with loves, and hates
and passions just like mine
they were born
and then they lived and then they died
which seems so unfair
and I wantr to crv

words which could only be your own
you then produce the text
from whence was ripped
(some dizzy whore, 1804)
A dreaded sunny day
so let's go where we're happy
so I meet you at the cemetry gates
Keats and Yeats are on your side
A dreaded sunny day
so let's go where we're wanted
so I meet you at the cemetry gates
Keats and Yeats are on your side
but you lose
because Wilde is on mine

 

LONDON

Smoke
Lingers 'round your fingers
Train
Heave on - to Euston
Do you think you've made
The right decision this time?
You left
Your tired family grieving
And you think they're sad because you're leaving
But didn't you see the Jealousy in the eyes
Of the ones who had to stay behind?
And do you think you've made
The right decision thins time?
You left
Your girlfriend on the platform
With thei really ragged notion that you'll return
But she knows
That when he goes
He really goes
So do you think you've made
The right decision this time?

 

I KNOW IT'S OVER

I can feel the soil falling over my head 
And as I climb into an empty bed 
Oh well. Enough said. 
I know it's over - still I cling 
I don't know where else I can go 
Over ... 
Oh Mother, I can feel the soil falling over my head 
See, the sea wants to take me 
The knife wants to cut me 
Do you think you can help me ? 
Sad veiled bride, please be happy 
Handsome groom, give her room 
Loud, loutish lover, treat her kindly 
(Though she needs you 
More than she loves you) 
And I know it's over - still I cling 
I don't know where else I can go 
Over, it's over, it's over, it's over 
It's over, la ... 
I know it's over 
And it never really began 
But in my heart it was so real
And you even spoke to me, and said : 
"If you're so funny 
Then why are you on your own tonight ? 
And if you're so clever 
Then why are you on your own tonight ? 
I know ... 
'Cause tonight - it's just like any other night 
That's why you're on your own tonight 
Your triumphs and your charms 
While they're in each other's arms..."
It's so easy to laugh 
It's so easy to hate 
It takes strength to be gentle and kind 
Over, over, over, over 
It's so easy to laugh 
It's so easy to hate 
It takes guts to be gentle and kind 
Over, over 
Love is Natural and Real 
But not for you, my love 
Not tonight, my love 
Love is Natural and Real 
But not for such as you and I, my love 
Oh Mother, I can feel the soil falling over my head...
Oh Mother, I can feel the soil fall over, fall over my head 
Oh Mother, I can feel the ... fall over my ... , Oh ...

 

THE DRAIZE TRAIN

A vastly superior version of the instrumental B-side, acting as a peace 
offering to Marr (Morrissey chose the tracks for the compilation, 
and of course, receives no royalties on this track).

 

STILL ILL

I decree today that life
is simply taking and not giving
England is mine and it owes me a living
ask me why, and I'll spit in your eye
ask me why, and I'll spit in your eye
but we cannot cling to the old dreams anymore
no, we cannot cling to the old dreams anymore
Does the body rule the mind
or does the mind rule the body?
I dunno...
Under the iron bridge we kissed
and although I ended up with sore lips
it just wasn't like the old days anymore
no, it wasn't like those days
am I still ill?
Does the body rule the mind
or does the mind rule the body ?
I dunno...
Ask me why, and I'll die
ask me why, and I'll die
and if you must go to work tomorrow
well, if I were you I wouldn't bother
for there are brighter sides to life
and I should know because I've seen them
but not very often...
under the iron bridge we kissed
and although I ended up with sore lips
it just wasn't like the old days anymore
no, it wasn't like those days
am I still ill?

 

BIGMOUTH STRIKES AGAIN

Sweetness, sweetness I was only joking
when I said Id like to smash every tooth
in your head
Sweetness, sweetness I was only joking
when I said by right s you should be
bludgeoned in your bed
and now I know how Joan of Arc felt
now I know how Joan of Arc felt
as the flames roseto her roman nose
and her Walkman stared to melt
Bibmouth, bigmouth
bigmouth strikes again
and Ive got no right to take my place
with the Human race
and now I know how Joan of Arc felt
now I know of Joan of Arc felt
as the flames rose to her roman nose
and her hearing aid started to melt
Bigmouth, bigmouth
bigmouth strikes again
and Ive got no right to take my place
with the Human race

 
ALSATIAN COUSTIN

Were you and he Lovers?
and would you say so if you were?
on a forecourt
on a Friday
passing my way
Were you and he Lovers?
and if you were, then say that you were!
on a groundsheet
under canvas
with your tent-flap
open wide
A note upon his desk:
"P.S. Bring Me Home And Have Me!"
Leather elbows on a tweed coat
- Oh! -
Is THAT the best you can do?
So came his reply:
"...but on the desk is where I want you!"
So I ask (even though I know):
were you and he Lovers?

 

LITTLE MAN, WHAT NOW?

An afternoon nostalgia
television show
you spoke in silhouette
(but they couldn't name you)
although the panel were
very polite to you
but I remembered you
from Friday nights 1969
ATV - you murdered every line
too old to be a child star
too young to take leads
four seasons passed
and they AXED you
nervously juvenile
(WON'T SMILE!)
What became of you?
did that swift eclipse torture you?
a star at eighteen
and then-suddenly gone
down to a few lines
in the back page of a teenage annual
oh but I remembered you
I looked up to you

 

EVERYDAY IS LIKE SUNDAY

Trudging slowly over wet sand
back to the bench
where your clothes were stolen
this is the coastal town
that they forgot to close down
Armageddon - come Armageddon!
Come Armageddon! Come!
Everyday is like Sunday
everyday is silent and grey
Hide on the promenade
scratch out a postcard
"how I dearly with I was not here"
in the seaside town
...that they forgot to bomb
Come! Come! Come - nuclear bomb!
Everyday is like Sunday
everyday is silent and grey
Trudging back over pebbles and sand
and a strange dust lands on your hands
(and on your face)
Everyday is like Sunday
"Win Yourself A Cheap Tray"
share some greased tea with me
everyday is silent and grey

 

BENGALI IN PLATFORMS

No no no
he does not want to depress you
oh no no no no no
he only wants to impress you
Bengali in platform
she only wants to embrace your culture
and to be your friend forever
Bengali, Bengali
oh shelve your Western plans
and understand that life is hard enough when you belong here
A silver-studded rim that glistens
and an ankle-star that...blinds me
a lemon sole so very high
which only reminds me, to tell you
so I break the news gently
I break the news to you gently
"Shelve your plans"
Bengali, Bengali
its the touchy march of time
that blinds you
don't blame me
don't hate me
just because I'm the one to tell you
that life is hard enough when you belong here
life is hard enough when you belong here
shelve your western plans
life is hard enough when you belong here

 

ANGEL, ANGEL, DOWN WE GO TOGETHER

Angel, Angel
don't take your life tonight
I know they take
and that they take in turn
and they give you nothing real
for yourself in return
and when they've used you
and they've broken you
and wasted all your money
and cast your shell aside
and when they've bought you
and they've sold you
and they've billed you for the pleasure
and they've made your parents cry
I will be here
BELIEVE ME
I will be here
...believe me
Angel, don't take your life
some people have got no pride
they do not understand
the Urgency of life
but I love you more than life
I love you more than life
I love you more than life
I love you more than life

 

LALE NIGHT, MAUDLIN STREET

The last night on Maudlin Street
goodbye house
goodbye stairs
I was born here
I was raised here, and
...I took some stick here
love at first sight
may sound trite
but it's true, you know
I could list the details
of everything you ever wore
or said, or how you stood that day
and as we spend the last night
on Maudlin Street, I say
"goodbye house-forever!"
I never stole a happy hour
around here
Where the world's ugliest boy
became what you see
here I am - the ugliest man
Its the last night on Maudlin Street
and truly I do love you
oh, truly I do love you
When I sleep with that picture of
you framed beside my bed
oh, it's childish and it's silly
but I think it's you in my room
by the bed (...yes, I told you it was silly...)
and I know
I took strange pills
but I never meant to hurt you
oh truly I love you
I came home late one night
everyone had gone to bed
nobody stays up for you
when you have sixteen stitches
all around your head
the last buss I missed to Maudlin Street
so, he drove me home in the Van
complaining: "Women only like me for my mind..."
don't leave your torch behind
power-cuts ahead
as we crept through the park
but no I cannot steal a pair of jeans
off a clothesline for you
but you...without clothes
oh I could not keep a straight face
me - without clothes?
well a nation turns its back and gags...
I'm packed
I am moving house
a half-life disappears today
every slag waves me on
(secretly wishing me gone
well, I will be soon
oh - I will be soon)
There were bad times on Maudlin Street
when they took you away in a police car
dear Inspector - don't you know?
don't you care?
don't you know - about Love?
Your gran died
and your mother died
on Maudlin Street
in pain and ashamed
with never time to say
those special things
I took the keys from Maudlin Street
well, it's only bricks and mortar!
and...truly I do love you
wherever you are
wherever you are

 

SUEDHEAD

Why do you come here
why do you hang around
I'm so sorry
I'm so sorry
Why do you come here
when you know it makes
things hard for me
when you know, oh
why do you come?
Why do you telephone?
and why send me silly notes?
I'm so sorry
I'm so sorry
why do you come here
when you know it makes
thing hard for me
when you know, oh
why do you come?
You had to sneak into my room
'just' to read my diary
was it just to see all the things
you knew I'd written about you?
and...so many illustrations
I'm so very sickened
oh, I am so sickened NOW

 

BREAK UP THE FAMILY

The strange logic of your clumsiest line
stayed emblazoned on my mind
break up the family
and lets begin to live our lives
I went to see all my friends tonight
it wasn't Youth, it wasn't even Life
born Old, sadly wise
resigned (well, we were)
to ending our lives
I'm so glad to grow older
to move away from those awful times
I want to see all my friends tonight
Yes you found love but you weren't
at peace with your life
home late, full of Hate
despise the ties that bind
oh I'm so glad to grow older
to move away from those younger years
now I'm in love for the first time
and I don't feel bad
Let me see all my old friends
let me put my arm around them
because I really do love them
now, does that sound mad?
Captain of games, solid framed
I stood on the touchline
hailstones, driven home
in his car - no breaks? I don't mind
I'm just so glad to grow older
to move away from those darker years
I'm in love for the first time
and I don't feel bad
so wish me luck my friends
goodbye

 

HAIRDRESSER ON FIRE

Here is London
here is London
is it home of the free,
or what?
can you squeeze me
into an empty page of your diary
and psychologically save me
I've got faith in you
I sense the power
in the fingers
within an hour the power
can totally destroy me
or it could same my life
here is London
'home of the brash, outrageous
and free'
you are repressed
but you're remarkably dressed
is it Real?
but you're far to busy
busy scissors
busy clippers
hair dresser on fire
all around Sloane Square
and you're far too busy
to see me
"busy,busy"
hairdresser on fire
was a client over-cautious
he made you nervous
and when he said
"I'm gonna sue you"
I really felt for you
so can you squeeze me
into an empty page of your diary
and supernaturally change me
CHANGE ME, CHANGE ME

 

THE ORDINARY BOYS

Ordinary boys, happy knowing nothing
happy being no one, but themselves
Ordinary girls, supermarket clothes
who think it's very clever to be cruel to you
for you were so different
you stood all alone
and you knew
that it had to be so
avoiding ordinary boys
happy going nowhere, just around here
in their rattling cars
and ordinary girls
never seeing further
than the cold, small streets
that trap them
but you were so different
you had to say no
when those empty fools
tried to change you, and claim you
for the lair of their ordinary world
where they feel so lucky
so lucky, so lucky
with their lives laid out before them
they're so lucky, so lucky
so lucky, so lucky

 

I DON'T MIND IF YOU FORGET ME

I don't mind
I don't mind if you forget me
having learned my lesson
I never left an impression on anyone
so now you send me your hardened 'regards'
when once you'd send me 'love'
sincerely I must tell you
your mild 'best wishes'
they make me suspicious
but I don't mind
I don't mind if you forget me
having learned my lesson
I never left
an impression on anyone
the pressure to change, to move on
was strange
and very strong
so this is why I tell you
I really do understand
BYE BYE
I don't mind if you forget me
no no no no no no no
REJECTION IS ONE THING
BUT REJECTION FROM A FOOL
IS CRUEL
REJECTION IS ONE THING
BUT REJECTION FROM A FOOL
IS CRUEL
and I don't mind if you forget me
I don't mind if your forget me

 

DIAL-A-CLICHE

Further into the fog I fall
well, I was just
following you!
when you said:
"Do as I do and scrap your fey ways"
(dial-a-cliche)
"grow up, be a man, and close your mealy-mouth!"
(dial-a-cliche)
But the person underneath
where does he go?
does he slide by the wayside?
or...does he just die?
when you find that you've organized
your feelings, for people
who didn't like you then
and certainly don't like you now
yet still you say:
"Do as I do and scrap your fey ways"
(dial-a-cliche)
"grow up, be a man, and close your mealy-mouth!"
(dial-a-cliche)
"the Safe way is the only way!
there's always time to change, son!"
yes well I've changed
but I'm in pain!
dial-a-chiche

 

MARGARET ON THE GUILLOTINE

The kind people
have a wonderful dream
Margaret on the guillotine
because people like you
make me feel so tired
when will you die?
when will you die?
when will you die?
when will you die?
when will you die?
because people like you
make me feel so old inside
please die
and kind people
do not shelter this dream
make it real
make the dream real
make the dream real
make it real

 

OUR FRANK

Our frank and open
deep conversations
they get me nowhere
they bring me down, so
give it a rest, won't you?
give me a cigarette
God give me patience
just no more conversation
Give us a drink
and make it quick
or else I'm gonna be sick
sick all over
your frankly vulgar
red pullover
now see how the colours blend
Our frank and open
deep conversations
they get me nowhere
they bring me down, so
give it a rest, won't you?
now will you just give over
the world may be ending
but look, I'm only human
Give us a drink
and make it quick
or else I'm gonna be sick
all over
your frankly vulgar
red pullover
now see how the two colours blend
Won't somebody stop me
from thinking all the time
about everything
so deeply
so bleakly

 

ASIAN RUT

Day oh so late
strangely the sun still shone
oh Asian boy
what are you on?
Day oh so late
strangely the sun still shone
what drugs are you on?
Tooled-up Asian boy
has come here to avenge
the cruel, cold killing
of his very best friend
Tooled-up Asian boy
has come here to take revenge
for the cruel, cold killing
of his only friend
Peace through the school
so quiet in the hall
it's a strange sign for one
of what's to come
Tough and hard and pale
oh they may just impale you on railings
oh English boys
it must be wrong
three against one?
Brakes slammed, and
a gun jammed, and
as far as I could tell
brave Asian boy
dealt a blow and fell
I'm just passing through here
on my way to somewhere civilised
and maybe I'll even arrive
maybe I'll even arrive?

 

SING YOUR LIFE

Sing your life
any fool can think of words that rhyme
many others do
why don't you?
do you want to?
Sing your life
just walk right up to the microphone
and name
all the things that you love
all the things that you loathe
sing your life
all the things that you love
all the things that you loathe
oh sing your life
oh sing your life
Others sang your life
but now's your chance to shine
and have the pleasure of
saying what you mean
the rare pleasure of
meaning what you sing
oh, make no mistake, my friend
all of this will end
so sing it now
all the things you love
all the things you loathe
oh sing your life
all the things that you love
all the things that you loathe
oh sing your, oh sing your
Don't leave it all unsaid
somewhere in the wasteland of your head
and make no mistake, my friend
your pointless life will end
but before you go
can you look at the truth?
You have a lovely singing voice
a lovely singing voice
and all of those
who sing on key
they stole the notion
from you and me

 

MUTE WITNESS

Your poor witness
crying so loudly on the floor
oh but she's only trying to tell you
what it was that she saw
she is only trying to tell you
what it was that she saw
Now see her standing on the table
with her small arms flailing
and you feel such compassion
in your soul for
Your poor mute witness
still testing the strength
of our patience
oh but she's only trying to tell you
what it was that she saw
Now see her pointing to the frisbee
with a memory too fuzzy
as her silent words
describe the fright of last night
4 a.m. Norhtside, Clapham Common
who knows what she was doing there?
will she sketch the answer later?
Well, I'll ask her
"now dry your tears, my dear"
Now see her mime in time so nicely
it would all have been so clear
is only she had never volunteered
"your taxi is here, my dear"

 

KING LEER

Your boyfriend, he
went down on one knee
well, could it be
he's only got one knee?
I tried to surprise you
with Vodka
or, Tizer
I can't quite remember
but you didn't thank me
you didn't even thank me
because you never do
Your boyfriend, he
has the gift of the gab
or, could it be
the gift of the grab?
I tried to surprise you
I lay down beside you
and...nothing much happened
and you didn't phone me
you didn't even phone me
because it's not your style
to dial
Your boyfriend, he
displays to me
more than just
a hint of cruelty
I tried to surprise you
I crept up behind you
with a homeless chihuahua
you gushed for an hour
you handed him back and said
"You'll never guess
I'm bored now"

 

FOUND FOUND FOUND

found found found found found found
someone who's worth it
in this murkiness
someone who's never
seeming scheming
found found found found found found
someone who's worth it
in this murkiness
someone who's never
seeming scheming
Oh, but if I'd never found
oh, but if I'd never found
oh, but if I'd never found
I do believe that
the more you give your love
and I do believe that
the more you offer trust
the more you chase
the more you cry
the more you're bound to lose
the more you're bound to lose
Oh, but if I'd never found
oh, but if I'd never found
somebody
who wants to be
who wants to be
with me
all the time

 

DRIVING YOUR GIRLFRIEND HOME

I'm driving
your girlfriend home
and she's saying
how she never chose you
"turn left", she says
so I turn left
and she says
"So how did I end up
so deeply involved in
the very existence
I planned on avoiding?"
and I can't answer
I'm driving
your girlfriend home
and she's laughing
to stop herself crying
"drive on", she says
so I drive on
and she says
"So how did I end up
attached to this person
when his sense of humour
gets gradually worser?"
and I can't tell her
I'm parking
outside her home
and we're shaking hands
goodnight, so politely

 

THE HARSH TRUTH OF THE CAMERA EYE

Churchillian legs
hair barely there
the harsh truth of the camera eye
Your eyes signal pain
because of the strain
of smiling
the harsh truth of the camera eye
telling you all
that you never wnated to know
showing what
you didn't want shown
My so friendly lens
zooms into
"the inner you"
and it tells the harsh truth
and nothing but
Laugh with us all here
that's if you can
then take the pictures home
and screamtelling you all
that you never wanted to know
showing you what
you didn't want shown
This photographer
he must have really had it in for you
"Oh, I don't want
to be judged anymore
I don't wnat to be judged
I would sooner be Loved
I would sooner be
just blindly Loved..."

 

(I'M) THE END OF THE FAMILY LINE

With no complications
fifteen generations
(of mine)
all honouring Nature
until I arrive
(with incredible style)
I'm the end fo the line
the end of the family line
the end of the line
No baby pulled screaming
out into this seething whirl
by chance or whim
(or even love?)
our family tree hacked into decline
and I'm spared the pain
of ever saying
("goodbye")
I'm the end of the line
the end of the family line
the end of the line

 

THERE'S A PLACE IN HELL FOR ME AND MY FRIENDS

There is a place
reserved
for me and my friends
and when we go
we all will go
so you see
I'm never alone
there is a place
with a bit more time
and a few more
gentler words
and looking back
we do forgive
(we had no choice
we always did)
all that we hope
is that when we go
our skin
and our blood
and our bones
don't get in your way
making you ill
the way they did
when we lived
There is a place
a place in hell
reserved
for me and my friends
and if ever I
wanted to cry
then I will
because I can

 

TONY THE PONY

Still drinking on the corner 
Just don't say I didn't warn you 
Always nagging big brother 
He's only looking out for you 
Tony The Pony 
Tony The Pony 
You're still standing on the corner 
Just don't say I didn't warn you 
Old and jealous big brother 
You had your time and you spent it 
Crying 
Now, Tony The Pony 
Tony The Pony 
So, that's what they call you now ? 
When you're free outside 
So cold and hard and in control 
And ... 
There's a free ride on 
Tony The Pony 
Oh, why do you always wanna stop me 
From doing the things in life that make me happy ? 
And when I'm outside with friends, laughing loudly 
Why do you always wanna stop me ? 
Oh, I would never 
I would never 
But you will carry the can for anyone 
The free ride on 
Gullible Tony 
You're drunker quicker 
And you're sicker even quicker 
For something heavy is gonna fall on you 
Oh ... 
And what do they call you now ? 
When you're free outside 
So cold and hard and in control 
And, oh ... been a lark 
There's a free ride on 
Fucked-up Tony 
I will never say I told you so 
Or how I knew that something bad 
Would happen to you 
I don't wanna say I told you so 
Oh, but Tony, I told you so !!! 
I told you so

 

YOU'RE GONNA NEED SOMEONE ON YOUR SIDE

With the world's fate 
Resting on your shoulder 
You're gonna need 
Someone on your side 
You can't do it by yourself 
Any longer 
You're gonna need 
Someone on your side 
Someone kindly told me 
That you'd wasted 
Eight of nine lives
Oh, give yourself a break 
Before you break down 
You're gonna need someone on your side 
And here I am, And here I am 
Well, you don't need 
To look so pleased ! 
Day or night, 
There is no difference 
You're gonna need someone on your side 
Day or night, 
There is no difference 
You're gonna need someone soon 
And here I am, And here I am 
Well, you don't need 
To look so pleased

 

GLAMOROUS GLUE

First day with the jar 
You find 
Everyone lies 
First day with the jar 
You find 
Everyone lies, nobody minds 
Everyone lies 
Where is the man you respect ? 
And where is the woman you love ? 
Where's the woman you love ? 
Third week with the jar
You find 
Everything dies 
We won't vote Conservative 
Because we never have 
Everyone lies, everyone lies 
Where is the man you respect ? 
And where is the woman you love ? 
Where's the woman you love ? 
Everything of worth 
On Earth Is there To share 
I used to dream, and I used to vow 
I wouldn't dream of it now 
We look to Los Angeles 
For the language we use 
London is dead, London is dead, London is dead...
Now I'm too much in love 
I'm too much in love 
I know 
I'll go 
Empty hand 
From the land

 

WE'LL LET YOU KNOW

How sad are we ? 
And how sad have we been ? 
We'll let you know 
We'll let you know 
Oh, but only if - you're really interested 
You wonder how 
We've stayed alive 'till now 
We'll let you know 
We'll let you know 
But only if - you're really interested 
We're all smiles 
Then, honest, I swear, it's the turnstiles 
That make us hostile 
Oh ... 
We will descend 
On anyone unable to defend 
Themselves 
Oh ... 
And the songs we sing 
They're not supposed to mean a thing 
La, la, la, la ... 
Oh ...You're lonely, Oh ... you're lonely, Oh ... 
GET OFF THE ROOF ! Oh ... 
Your Arsenal !
We may seem cold, or 
We may even be 
The most depressing people you've ever known 
At heart, what's left, we sadly know 
That we are the last truly British people you'll ever know 
We are the last truly British people you will ever know 
You'll never never want to know

 

THE NATIONAL FRONT DISCO

David, the wind blows 
The wind blows ... 
Bits of your life away 
Your friends all say ... 
"Where is our boy ? Oh, we've lost our boy" 
But they should know 
Where you've gone 
Because again and again you've explained that 
You're going to ... 
Oh, you're going to ... 
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah 
England for the English ! 
England for the English ! 
David, the winds blow 
The winds blow ...
All of my dreams away 
And I still say : 
"Where is our boy ? Ah, we've lost our boy" 
But I should know 
Why you've gone 
Because again and again you've explained
You've gone to the ... 
National, ah ... 
To the National .. 
There's a country; you don't live there 
But one day you would like to 
And if you show them what you're made of 
Oh, then you might do ... 
But David, we wonder 
We wonder if the thunder 
Is ever really gonna begin 
Begin, begin 
Your mom says : 
"I've lost my boy" 
But she should know 
Why you've gone 
Because again and again you've explained 
You've gone to the : 
National 
To the National 
To the National Front Disco 
Because you want the day to come sooner 
You want the day to come sooner 
You want the day to come sooner 
When you've settled the score 
Oh, the National 
Oh, the National

 

CERTAIN PEOPLE I KNOW

I take the cue from 
Certain people I know 
I use the cue 
And then I 
Hand it on to you 
And when I swing it 
So, it catches his eye ... 
(Weren't you there ? 
- You'd have died !) 
I trust the views of 
Certain people I know 
They look at Danger 
And they 
LAUGH THEIR HEADS OFF 
Their clothes are Imitation 
George the 23rd 
(Don't you find this absurd ?) 
I'd hate to be like 
Certain people I know 
They break their necks 
And can't afford to
Get them fixed 
Ah, they'd sacrifice all 
Of their principles for 
anything cashable 
I do believe it's terrible 
Oh, wo, wo, Ah, ah, ah, ah, Oh, wo, wo...

 

WE HATE IT WHEN OUR FRIENDS BECOME SUCCESSFUL

We hate it when our friends become successful 
We hate it when our friends become successful 
Oh, look at those clothes 
Now look at that face, it's so old 
And such a video ! 
Well, it's really laughable 
Ha, ha, ha ...
We hate it when our friends become successful 
And if they're Northern, that makes it even worse
And if we can destroy them 
You bet your life we will 
Destroy them 
If we can hurt them 
Well, we may as well ... 
It's really laughable 
Ha, ha, ha ... 
You see, it should've been me 
It could've been me 
Everybody knows 
Everybody says so 
They say : 
"Ah, you have loads of songs 
So many songs 
More songs than they'd stand 
Verse 
Chorus 
Middle eight 
Break, fade 
Just listen ..."
La, la-la, la-la

SEASICK, YET STILL DOCKED

I am a poor freezingly cold soul 
So far from where 
I intended to go 
Scavenging through life's very constant lulls 
So far from where I'm determined to go 
Wish I knew the way to reach the one I love
There is no way ... 
Wish I had the charm to attract the one I love 
But you see, I've got no charm 
Mmm...
Tonight I've consumed much more than I can hold 
Oh, this is very clear to you 
And you can tell I have never really loved 
You can tell, by the way, I sleep all day
And all of my life no-one gave me anything 
No-one has ever given me anything 
My love is as sharp as a needle in your eye 
You must be such a fool 
To pass me by

 

I KNOW IT'S GONNA HAPPEN SOMEDAY

My love, wherever you are 
Whatever you are 
Don't lose faith 
I know it's gonna happen someday 
To you 
Please wait ... Please wait ... Oh ... Wait ... 
Don't lose faith 
You say that the day just never arrives 
And it's never seemed so far away 
Still, I know it's gonna happen someday 
To you 
Please wait ... 
Don't lose faith

 

TOMORROW

Tomorrow 
Will it really come ? 
And if it does come 
Will I still be Human ? 
All I ask of you is one thing that you never do 
Would you put your arms around me ?

Tomorrow 
Does it have to come ?
All I ask of you is one thing that you'll never do 
Would you put your arms around me ? 
(I won't tell anybody) 
Tomorrow 
And what must come before ...
Oh, the pain in my arms 
Oh, the pain in my legs 
Ooh, my shiftless body 
Tomorrow 
It's surely nearer now ? 
You don't think I'll make it 
I never said I wanted to ! 
Well did I ? 
Oh, the pain in my arms 
Oh, the pain in my legs 
Oh, yeah; oh, yeah, No, yeah; no, yeah 
Through my shiftless body 
Tomorrow, Tomorrow 
All I ask of you ... oh ... 
Is : would you tell me that you love me 
Tell me, tell me that you love me, Tell me, tell me that you love me ... 
Ah, I know you don't mean it

Tell me, tell me that you love me, Tell me, tell me that you love me ...

NOVEMBER SPAWNED A MONSTER

Sleep on and dream of Love
because it's the closest you will get to love
poor twisted child, so ugly, so ugly
poor twisted child, oh hug me, oh hug me
one November spawned a monster 
in the shape of this child who later cried
"But Jesus made me, so Jesus save me from
pity, sympathy and people discussing me"
a frame of useless limbs what can make GOOD
all the BAD that's been done?
And if the lights were out
could you even bear
to kiss her full on the mouth (or anywhere?)
poor twisted child, so ugly, so ugly
poor twisted child, oh hug me, oh hug me
one November spawned a monster 
in the shape of this child who must remain
a hostage to kindess and the wheels underneath her
a hostage to kindess and the wheels underneath her
a symbol of where mad, mad lovers
must PAUSE and draw the line
So sleep and dream of love
because it's the closest
you will get to love
that November is a time which I must put OUT of my mind
oh one fine day 
LET IT BE SOON
she won't be rich or beautiful
but she'll be walking your streets
in the clothes that she went out
and chose for herself

 

SEASICK, YET STILL DOCKED

THE LOOP

I just wanna say 
I haven't been away 
I'm still right here 
Where I always was 
So one day, if you're bored 
By all means call 
Because you can do 
(But only if you want to) 
I just wanna say 
I haven't been away 
I am still right here 
Where I always was 
So one day, when you're bored 
By all means call 
Because you can do 
But you might not get through

 

SISTER I'M A POET

All over this town 
Yes, a low wind may blow 
And I can see through everybo... 
With no reason 
To hide these words I feel 
And no reason 
To talk about the books I read 
But still I do 
That's 'cause I'm a ... Sister I'm a ... 
All over this town 
Along this way 
Outside the prison gates 
I love the romance of crime 
And I wonder 
Does anybody feel the way I do ? 
And is evil just something you are 
Or something you do ? 
Sister I'm a ... Sister I'm a ... 
All over this town, All over this town 
They pull over 
In their Citroen vans 
Not to shake your hand 
With meths on their breaths 
And you with youth on your side 
A plastic bag stranded at the lights 
This once was me ...
But now I'm a ... Sister I'm a ...
All over this town ... Oh, oh, oh 
All over this town, All over this town, Oh ... 
I still cannot speak French ... I am very lazy

 

JACK THE RIPPER

Oh, you look so tired 
Mouth slack and wide 
Ill-housed and ill-advised 
Your face is as mean 
As your life has been 
Crash into my arms 
I WANT YOU 
You don't agree -
But you don't refuse 
I know you 
And I know a place 
Where no one is likely to pass 
Oh, you don't care if it's late 
And you don't care if you're lost 
And oh, you look so tired 
(But tonight you presumed too much) 
Too much, too much 
And if it's the last 
Thing I ever do 
I'M GONNA GET YOU 
Crash into my arms 
I WANT YOU 
You don't agree -
But you don't refuse 
I know you 
And no one knows a thing about my life 
I can come and go as I please 
And if I want to, I can stay 
Oh, or if I want to, I can leave 
Nobody knows me, Nobody knows me, Nobody knows me Oh, oh...

 

SUCH A LITTLE THING MAKES SUCH A BIG DIFFERENCE

Such a little thing, such a little thing
but the difference it made was grave
there you go
wielding a bicycle chain
oh why won't you change
cange and be nicer?
such a little thing
a gentle tone of kindness
or written words on paper
- can you write?
How I love all of
the very simple things of life
(God's good air)
how I love all of
the very simple things of life
such a little thing
a fumbling politeness
the difference it saved me
wielding a bicycle chain
"I WILL NOT CHANGE AND I WILL NOT BE NICE"
Most people keep their brains between your legs (don't you find?)
Leave me alone - I was only singing, leave me alone because
I was only singing
leave me alone - I was only singing, leave me alone
you have just proved (again)
MOST PEOPLE KEEP THEIR BRAINS BETWEEN THEIR LEGS

 

I KNOW IT'S GONNA HAPPEN SOMEDAY

My love, wherever you are 
Whatever you are 
Don't lose faith 
I know it's gonna happen someday 
To you 
Please wait ... 
Please wait ... 
Oh ... Wait ... 
Don't lose faith 
You say that the day just never arrives 
And it's never seemed so far away 
Still, I know it's gonna happen someday 
To you 
Please wait ... 
Don't lose faith

 

WE'LL LET YOU KNOW

How sad are we ? 
And how sad have we been ? 
We'll let you know, We'll let you know 
Oh, but only if - you're really interested 
You wonder how 
We've stayed alive 'till now 
We'll let you know, We'll let you know 
But only if - you're really interested 
We're all smiles 
Then, honest, I swear, it's the turnstiles 
That make us hostile 
Oh ... We will descend 
On anyone unable to defend 
Themselves 
Oh ... And the songs we sing 
They're not supposed to mean a thing 
La, la, la, la ... Oh ...
You're lonely, Oh ... you're lonely 
Oh ... 
GET OFF THE ROOF !
Oh ... Your Arsenal !
We may seem cold, or 
We may even be 
The most depressing people you've ever known 
At heart, what's left, we sadly know 
That we are the last truly British people you'll ever know 
We are the last truly British people you will ever know 
You'll never never want to know

 

SUEDHEAD

Why do you come here
why do you hang around
I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry
Why do you come here
when you know it makes
things hard for me
when you know, oh
why do you come?
Why do you telephone?
and why send me silly notes?
I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry
why do you come here
when you know it makes
thing hard for me
when you know, oh
why do you come?
You had to sneak into my room
'just' to read my diary
was it just to see all the things
you knew I'd written about you?
and...so many illustrations
I'm so very sickened
oh, I am so sickened NOW

 

HE KNOWS I'D LOVE TO SEE HIM

He Knows (he knows)
Or, I think he does
because when I lived
in the Arse of the world...
he knows, he knows, he knows I'd love
to see him happy (or as close as is allowed)
because when I lived
in the Arse of the world
he knows, he knows, he knows I'd love
to see him happy (or as close as possible
as close as possible, as close as is allowed)
My name still conjours up deadly deeds
and a bad taste in the mouth
the police - they actually knew me
they said:
"You're just another person in the world
you're just another fool with radical views
you're just another who has maddening views
you want to turn it on its head
by staying in bed!"
I said: "I know I do"

 

YOU'RE GONNA NEED SOMEONE ON YOUR SIDE

With the world's fate 
Resting on your shoulder 
You're gonna need 
Someone on your side 
You can't do it by yourself 
Any longer 
You're gonna need 
Someone on your side 
Someone kindly told me 
That you'd wasted 
Eight of nine lives
Oh, give yourself a break 
Before you break down 
You're gonna need someone on your side 
And here I am, And here I am 
Well, you don't need 
To look so pleased ! 
Day or night, 
There is no difference 
You're gonna need someone on your side 
Day or night, 
There is no difference 
You're gonna need someone soon 
And here I am, And here I am 
Well, you don't need 
To look so pleased

 

GLAMOROUS GLUE

First day with the jar 
You find 
Everyone lies 
First day with the jar 
You find 
Everyone lies, nobody minds, Everyone lies 
Where is the man you respect ? 
And where is the woman you love ? 
Where's the woman you love ? 
Third week with the jar
You find 
Everything dies 
We won't vote Conservative 
Because we never have 
Everyone lies, everyone lies 
Where is the man you respect ? 
And where is the woman you love ? 
Where's the woman you love ? 
Everything of worth 
On Earth, Is there, To share 
I used to dream, and I used to vow 
I wouldn't dream of it now 
We look to Los Angeles 
For the language we use 
London is dead, London is dead, London is dead, ...
Now I'm too much in love 
I'm too much in love, 
I know I'll go 
Empty hand 
From the land

NOW MY HEART IS FULL

There's gonna be some trouble 
A whole house will need re-building 
And everyone I love in the house 
Will recline on an analyst's couch quite 
Soon 
Your Father cracks a joke 
And in the usual way 
Empties the room 
Tell all of my friends 
(I don't have too many 
Just some rain-coated lovers' puny brothers)
Dallow, Spicer, Pinkie, Cubitt 
Rush to danger 
Wind up nowhere 
Patric Doonan - raised to wait 
I'm tired again, I've tried again, and 
Now my heart is full 
Now my heart is full 
And I just can't explain 
So I won't even try to
Dallow, Spicer, Pinkie, Cubitt 
Every jammy Stressford poet 
Loafing oafs in all-night chemists 
Loafing oafs in all-night chemists 
Underact - express depression 
Ah, but Bunnie I loved you 
I was tired again 
I've tried again, and 
Now my heart is full 
Now my heart is full 
And I just can't explain 
So I won't even try to 
Could you pass by ? 
Could you pass by ? 
Oh ... 
Now my heart is full 
Now my heart is full 
And I just can't explain 
So ... slow ... 
Slow ... slow ... slow ... slow ... slow ...

 

SPRING-HEELED JIM

Spring-heeled Jim winks an eye 
He'll "do", he'll never be "done to" 
He takes on whoever flew through 
"Well, it's the normal thing to do" ... ah ... 
Spring-heeled Jim lives to love 
Now kissing with his mouth full 
And his eyes on some other fool 
So many women 
His head should be spinning 
Ah, but no ! 
Ah, but no ! 
But no !
Ah, no !
Spring-heeled Jim slurs the words : 
"There's no need to be so knowing
Take life at five times the 
Average speed, like I do" 
Until Jim feels the chill 
"Oh, where did all the time go ?" 
Once always in for the kill 
Now it's too cold 
And he feels too 
old 
Too old
Mmm, old... 
La, la, la, la-la, la ...

 

BILLY BUDD

Say, Billy Budd 
So you think you should ? 
Oh, everyone's laughing 
Say, Billy Budd 
So you think that you should ? 
Everyone's laughing ! 
Since I took up with you 
Things have been bad 
Yeah, but now it's 12 years on 
Now it's 12 years on 
Yes, and I took up with you 
I took my job application 
Into town 
Did you hear ? They turned me down 
Yes, and it's all because of us 
Oh, and what was in our eyes 
Oh, what was in our eyes, yeah 
I said, Billy Budd 
I would happily lose 
Both of my legs 
I would lose both of my legs 
Oh, if it meant you could be free 
Oh, if it meant you could be free 
(Don't leave us in the dark!)

 

HOLD ON TO YOUR FRIENDS

A bond of trust 
Has been abused 
Something of value 
May be lost 
Give up your job 
Squander your cash - be rash 
Just hold on to your friends 
There are more than enough 
To fight and oppose 
Why waste good time 
Fighting the people you like 
Who will fall defending your name 
Oh, don't feel so ashamed 
To have friends 
But now you only call me 
When you're feeling depressed 
When you feel happy I'm 
So far from your mind 
My patience is stretched 
My loyalty vexed 
Oh, you're losing all of your friends 
Hold on to your friends 
Hold on to your friends 
Resist - or move on 
Be mad, be rash 
Smoke and explode 
Sell all of your clothes 
Just bear in mind : 
Oh, there just might come a time 
When you need some friends

 

THE MORE YOU IGNORE ME, THE CLOSER I GET

The more you ignore me 
The closer I get 
You're wasting your time 
The more you ignore me 
The closer I get 
You're wasting your time 
I will be 
In the bar 
With my head 
On the bar 
I am now 
A central part 
Of your mind's landscape 
Whether you care 
Or do not 
Yeah, I've made up your mind 
The more you ignore me 
The closer I get 
You're wasting your time 
The more you ignore me 
The closer I get 
You're wasting your time 
Beware !
I bear more grudges 
Than lonely high court judges 
When you sleep 
I will creep 
Into your thoughts 
Like a bad debt 
That you can't pay 
Take the easy way 
And give in 
Yeah, and let me in 
Oh, let me in 
Oh let me ... 
Oh, let me in 
IT'S WAR 
IT'S WAR 
WAR 
WAR 
Oh, let me in 
Ah, the closer I get 
Ah, you're asking for it 
Ah, the closer I get 
Ooh, the closer I ...

 

WHY DON'T YOU FIND OUT FOR YOURSELF

The sanest days are mad 
Why don't you find out for yourself ? 
Then you'll see the price 
Very closely 
Some men here 
They have a special interest 
In your career 
They wanna help you to grow 
And then syphon all your dough 
Why don't you find out for yourself ? 
Then you'll see the glass 
Hidden in the grass 
You'll never believe me, so 
Why don't you find out for yourself ? 
Sick down to my heart 
That's just the way it goes 
Some men here 
They know the full extent of 
Your distress 
They kneel and pray 
And they say : 
"Long may it last" 
Why don't you find out for yourself ?
Then you'll see the glass 
Hidden in the grass 
Bad scenes come and go 
For which you must allow 
Sick down to my heart 
That's just the way it goes 
Don't rake up my mistakes 
I know exactly what they are 
And ... what do YOU do ? 
Well ... you just SIT THERE 
I've been stabbed in the back 
So many many times 
I don't have any skin 
But that's just the way it goes

A brick in the ... ah ... 
A brick in the small of the back again 
I just don't belong 
To anywhere 
I just don't belong 
Mmm ... 
Ah ...

 

LIFEGUARD SLEEPING, GIRL DROWNING

Always looking for attention 
Always needs to be mentioned 
Who does she 
Think she should be ? 
The shrill cry through darkening air 
Doesn't she know he's 
Had such a busy day ? 
Tell her ... sshhh
Somebody tell her ... sshhh 
Slowest ... 
It was only a test 
But she swam too far 
Against the tide 
She deserves all she gets 
The sky became marked with stars 
As an out-stretched arm slowly 
Disappears 
Hooray 
Oh hooray 
No, oh, oh, woh, there's no movement 
No, oh, hooray 
Oh, hooray 
Please don't worry 
There'll be no fuss 
She was ... nobody's nothing 
(What's your name ?) 
When he awoke 
The sea was calm 
And another day passes like a dream 
There's no ... no way 
(What's your name ?)

 

USED TO BE A SWEET BOY

Used to be a sweet boy 
Holding so tightly 
To Daddy's hand 
But that was all 
In some distant land 
Blazer and tie 
And a big bright healthy smile 
Used to make all 
Of our trials worthwhile 
Used to be a sweet boy 
And I'm not to blame 
Something went wrong 
And I know 
I'm not to blame 
Something went wrong 
Can't be to blame 
Ah ...

 

THE LAZY SUNBATHERS

A world war 
Was announced 
Days ago 
But they didn't know 
The lazy sunbathers 
The lazy sunbathers 
The sun burns through 
To the planet's core 
And it isn't enough 
They want more 
Nothing 
Appears 
To be 
Between the ears of 
The lazy sunbathers 
Too jaded 
To question stagnation 
The sun burns through 
To the planet's core 
And it isn't enough 
They want more 
Religions fall 
Children shelled 
"...Children shelled ? That's all 
Very well, but would you 
Please keep the noise 
Down low ? 
Because you're waking 
The lazy sunbathers ..."
Oh, the lazy sunbathers 
The lazy sunbathers

 

SPEEDWAY

And when you slam 
Down the hammer 
Can you see it in your heart ? 
All of the rumours 
Keeping me grounded 
I never said, I never said that they were 
Completely unfounded 
So when you slam 
Down the hammer 
Can you see it in your heart ? 
Can you delve so low ? 
And when you're standing 
On my fingers 
Can you see it in your heart ? ... ah ... 
And when you try 
To break my spirit 
It won't work 
Because there's nothing left to break 
Anymore 
All of the rumours 
Keeping me grounded 
I never said, I never said that they were 
Completely unfounded 
You won't sleep 
Until the earth that wants me 
Finally has me 
Oh you've done it now 
You won't rest 
Until the hearse that becomes me 
Finally takes me 
Oh you've done it now 
And you won't smile 
Until my loving mouth 
Is shut good and proper 
FOREVER 
All of the rumours 
Keeping me grounded 
I never said, I never said that they were 
Completely unfounded 
And all those lies 
Written lies, twisted lies 
Well, they weren't lies 
They weren't lies 
They weren't lies 
I never said 
I never said 
I could have mentioned your name 
I could have dragged you in 
Guilt by implication 
By association 
I've always been true to you 
In my own strange way 
I've always been true to you 
In my own sick way 
I'll always stay true to you

 

THE TEACHERS ARE AFRAID OF THE PUPILS

There's too many people 
Planning your downfall 
When your spirit's on trial 
These nights can be frightening 
Sleep transports sadness 
To some other mid-brain 
And somebody here 
Will not be here next year 
So you stand by the board 
Full of fear and intention 
And, if you think that they're listening 
Well, you've got to be joking 
Oh, you understand change 
And you think it's essential 
But when your profession 
Is humiliation 
Say the wrong word to our children ...
We'll have you, oh yes, we'll have you 
Lay a hand on our children 
And it's never too late to have you 
Mucus on your collar 
A nail up through the staff chair 
A blade in your soap 
And you cry into your pillow 
To be finished would be a relief 
To be finished would be a relief... 
Say the wrong word to our children ...
We'll have you, oh yes, we'll have you 
Lay a hand on our children 
And it's never too late to have you 
To be finished would be a relief 
To be finished would be a relief...
I'm very glad this thing has come 
Sometimes I'm so glad 
Never bother to play the tunes 
I've seen it coming for dear life

 

READER MEET AUTHOR

You don't know a thing about their lives 
They live where you wouldn't dare to drive
You shake as you think of how they sleep 
But you write as if you are my side-by-side 
Reader, meet Author 
With the hope of hearing sense 
But you may be feeling let down 
By the words of defence 
He says : "No-one ever sees me when I cry"
You don't know a thing about their lives 
Books don't save them, books aren't Stanley knives 
And if a fight broke out here tonight 
You'd be the first away, because you're that type 
And the Year 2000 won't change anyone here 
As each fabled promise flies so fast 
You'll swear it was never there 
Oh, have you ever escaped from a shipwrecked life ? 
So safely with your software; all miles from the front line 
You hear the way their sad voices, and you start to imagine things 
Oh, any excuse to write more lies

THE OPERATION

You fight with your right hand 
And caress with your left hand 
Everyone I know is sick to death of you 
With a tear that's a mile wide 
In the kite that you're flying 
Everyone I know is sick to death of you 
Ever since 
You don't look the same 
You're just not the same, no way 
You say clever things and 
You never used to 
You don't catch what I'm saying 
When you're deafened to advice 
Everyone here is sick to the 
Back teeth of you 
With a tear that's a mile wide 
In the kite that you're flying 
Everyone here is sick to the 
Tattoo of you 
Ever since 
You don't look the same 
You're just not the same, no way 
You say pleasant things and 
There is no need to
Still, you fight with your right hand 
And caress with your left hand 
Ooh, ooh ... Sad to say ... 
How once I was in love with you 
Sad to say ... 
You don't catch what I'm saying 
When you're deafened to advice 
Ooh, ooh ... Ever since 
You don't look the same 
You're just not the same, no way 
What the hell have 
They stuck into you ?

 

DAGENHAM DAVE

Head in the clouds, and a mouthful of pie 
Head in a blouse, everybody loves him 
I see why 
Dagenham Dave, Dagenham Dave, Oh, Dagenham Dave 
Dagenham Dave, Dagenham Dave, Oh, Dagenham Dave 
"I love Karen, I love Sharon" on the windowscreen 
With never the need to fight or to question a single thing 
Dagenham Dave, Dagenham Dave Oh, Dagenham Dave 
Dagenham Dave, Dagenham Dave Oh, Dagenham Dave ...
He'd love to touch, he's afraid that he might self-combust 
I could say more, but you get the general idea

Dagenham, Dagenham Dagenham Dave, Dagenham Dave ...
Oh, Dave, oh, Dagenham, dagenham, Oh, Dave, oh, Dave, ...

 

DO YOUR BEST AND DON'T WORRY

Compare the best of their days 
With the worst of your days 
You won't win 
With your standards so high 
And your spirits so low 
At least remember ... 
This is you on a bad day, you on a pale day 
Just do your best and don't ... Don't worry, oh 
The way you hang yourself is oh, so unfair 
See the best of how they look 
Against the worst of how you are
And again, you won't win 
With your standards so high 
And your spirits so low 
At least remember ... 
This is you on a drab day, you in a drab dress 
Just do your best and don't ... Don't worry, oh 
The way you hang yourself is oh, so unfair 
Just do your best and don't ... Don't worry, oh 
The way you watch yourself is oh, so unfair 
Just do your best and don't ... Don't worry, oh 
Do your best and don't ...

SOUTHPAW

You were a boy before you became a man 
I don't see the joy 
And you ran with your pals in the sun 
You turned around and they were gone 
Again ... 
A sick boy should be treated 
So easily defeated 
Oh, I just don't understand 
So you ran with your pals in the sun 
You turned around 
You were alone 
Again ... 
And you ran back to Ma 
Which set the pace for the rest of your days 
Oh, you ran back to Ma 
Which set the pace for the rest of your days 
Oh, you ran back to Ma 
Which set the pace for the rest of your days 
And now, there is something that you should know 
There is something that you should know 
The girl of your dreams is 
Here all alone 
Girl of your dreams is 
Here all alone 
The girl of your dreams is 
Sad and all alone

There is something that you should know

Sad and is all alone 
The girl of your dreams is 
Sad and is feeling all alone 
Oh, there is something that you should know 
Help me, help me, help me ...

 

MALADJUSTED

I wanna start from 
Before the beginning 
Loot wine, "Be mine, and 
Then let's stay out for the night"
Ride via Parkside 
Semi-perilous lives 
Jeer the lights in the windows 
Of all safe and stable homes 
(But wondering then, well what 
Could peace of mind be like ?)
Anyway do you want to hear 
Our story, or not ? 
As the Fulham Road lights 
Stretch and invite into the night 
From a Stevenage overspill 
We'd kill to live around 
SW6 - with someone like you 
Keep thieves' hours 
With someone like you 
...As long as it slides 
You stalk the house 
In a low-cut blouse : 
"Oh Christ, another stifled 
Friday night !"
And the Fulham Road lights 
Stretch and invite into the night 
Well, I was fifteen 
What could I know ?
When the gulf between 
All the things I need 
And the things I receive 
Is an ancient ocean 
Wide, wild, lost, uncrossed 
Still I maintain there's nothing 
Wrong with you 
You do all that you do 
Because it's all you can do 
Well, I was fifteen 
Where could I go ?
With a soul full of loathing 
For stinging bureaucracy 
Making it anything 
Other than easy 
For working girls like me 
With my hands on my head 
I flop on your bed 
With a head full of dread 
For all I've ever said 
Maladjusted, maladjusted 
Maladjusted maladjusted 
Never to be trusted 
Oh, never to be trusted 
There's nothing wrong with you, oh 
...There's nothing wrong with you

 

ALMA MATTERS

So : the choice I have made 
May seem strange to you 
But who asked you, anyway ? 
It's my life to wreck 
My own way 
You see : to someone, somewhere, oh yeah ... 
Alma matters 
In mind, body and soul 
In part, and in whole 
Because to someone, somewhere, oh yeah ... 
Alma matters 
In mind, body and soul 
In part, and in whole 
So the life I have made 
May seem wrong to you 
But, I've never been surer 
It's my life to ruin 
My own way 
You see : to someone, somewhere, oh yeah ... 
Alma matters 
In mind, body and soul 
In part, and in whole 
Because to someone, somewhere, oh yeah ... 
Alma matters 
In mind, body and soul 
In part, and in whole 
To someone, somewhere, oh yeah ... 
Alma matters 
In mind, body and soul 
Part, and in whole 
So to someone, somewhere, oh yeah ...

To someone, somewhere, oh yeah ... 
Oh yeah ... Oh yeah, oh yeah Oh yeah ...

 

AMBITIOUS OUTSIDERS

Bolt-lock your doors 
Alarm your cars 
And still we move in closer 
Every day 
Top of the list 
Is your smiling kids 
But we'll be smiling too 
So that's OK 
Oh, and by the way 
Thank you, because you're 
Giving, giving, giving 
And we're receiving - 
No, no, we're taking 
Keeping the population down 
Your taxes paid, but 
Police waylaid 
And we knows 
When the school bus 
Comes and goes 
We're on your street, but 
You don't see us 
Or, if you do 
You smile and say Hello 
BUT DON'T UNDERESTIMATE US 
When you are 
Giving, giving, giving 
And we're receiving - 
No, no, we're taking 
Just keeping 
The population down 
You're giving, giving, giving 
Well, it's your own fault 
For reproducing 
We're just keeping 
The population down

 

TROUBLE LOVES ME

Trouble loves me 
Trouble needs me 
Two things 
More than you do 
Or would attempt to 
So, console me 
Otherwise, hold me 
Just when it seems like 
Everything's evened out 
And the balance 
Seems serene 
Trouble loves me 
Walks beside me 
To chide me 
Not to guide me 
It's still much more 
Than you'll do 
So, console me 
Otherwise, hold me 
Just when it seems like 
Everything's evened out 
And the balance seems serene 
See the fool I'll be 
Still running 'round 
On the flesh rampage 
Still running 'round 
Ready with ready-wit 
Still running 'round 
On the flesh rampage 
- At your age ! 
Go to Soho, oh 
Go to waste in 
The wrong arms 
Still running 'round 
Trouble loves me 
Seeks and finds me 
To charlatanize me 
Which is only 
As it should be 
Oh, please fulfill me 
Otherwise, kill me 
Show me a barrel and watch me scrape it 
Faced with the music, as always I'll face it 
In the half-light 
So English, frowning 
Then at midnight I 
Can't get you out of my head 
A disenchanted taste 
Still running 'round 
A disenchanted taste 
Still running 'round

 

PAPA JACK

Papa Jack 
Wants to turn 
Back the clock 
And reach out 
To the kids 
He once had 
Who have flown 
Papa Jack 
In decline 
Feels inclined 
To reach out 
To the kids 
He once had 
Who have flown 
But there was a time 
When the kids reached up 
And Papa Jack just 
Pushed them away 
Looking deep 
In his heart 
Papa Jack 
Doesn't like 
What he sees 
Or the time 
On his hands 
The dying day 
The chilly sun 
Papa Jack 
All alone 
Sings slow 
Grieving and low 
But there was a time 
When the kids reached up 
Now you can't always 
Have it your way 
Papa Jack 
Ah ...

 

AMMUNITION

I know these roads 
Each ridge 
And narrow bridge 
Each cheveron 
Enticing me on 
Each warning sign 
I take in my stride 
I don't need more ammunition 
I've got more than I can spend 
I don't dwell on things I'm missing 
I'm just pleased 
With the things I've found 
I know these roads 
An old hand understands 
Above all, I know what's 
Expected of me now 
Veering cliffwards 
I don't need more ammunition 
I've got more than I can spend 
I don't dwell on things I'm missing 
I'm just pleased 
With the things I've found 
With the things I've found 
With the things I've found 
I've found 
I've been crying 
It comes back on these salient days 
And it stays 
And it says : 
"We've never really been away" 
I don't need more ammunition 
I've got more than I can spend 
I don't think of who I'm missing 
I've got no space and no time 
In my life, anymore 
No space or time 
In my life, anymore 
For Revenge

 

WIDE TO RECEIVE

Download something 
Useful, or useless 
Because I'm lying here 
Wide to receive 
Almost anything 
You'd care to give 
And I don't 
Get along with myself 
And I'm not too keen 
On anyone else 
Turn on, plug in 
Then just walk away 
Unlock, process 
And then just go 
And I've never felt quite so alone 
As I do right now 
I'm lying here 
Wide to receive 
Almost anything 
You'd care to leave 
Wide, wide, wide Wide, wide, wide...

 

ROY'S KEEN

(GO ON !)
He's romancing you 
And chancing his arm 
He'll be here 
Smiling on time 
He's romancing you 
And chancing his arm 
He'll be here 
Smiling on time 
Roy's keen oh Roy's keen 
Roy's keen oh Roy's keen 
We've never seen a 
Keener window-cleaner 
Back up the ladder 
Into each corner 
Dunking the chamois 
Just think of the goodwill 
The ladder's a planet 
Roy is a star, and 
I am a satellite 
(But that's alright) 
He can hold a smile for as long 
As you require (even longer) 
He can hold a smile for as long 
As you require (even longer) 
Roy's keen oh Roy's keen 
Roy's keen oh Roy's keen 
We've never seen a 
Keener window-cleaner 
Back up the ladder 
Into each corner 
Dunking the chamois 
Just think of the goodwill 
The ladder's a planet 
Roy is a star, and 
I am a satellite 
I will be set alight 
Don't say you'll hold it steady 
Then you let it go 
Don't say you'll hold it steady 
Then you let it go Oh ...
You're up the ladder 
Into each corner 
Foot in a bucket 
We trust you to wreck it 
Even when it's under your nose 
Well, you just can't 
See it, can you ? 
Well, it's here 
Right under your nose 
And you just can't 
See it, can you? La la la la ...
Roy's keen, Roy's keen La la la la ...
We've never seen a 
Keener window-cleaner 
Oh ... La la la la ...

 

HE CRIED

I need you 
Simple words 
But words which had never been heard 
By the soul 
Stoned to death 
But still living 
And so he froze where he stood 
And he looked to the ground 
And he cried 
He cried 
Ride our minds 
If you must 
But there's always a line you don't cross 
Time is short 
Don't be cruel 
Oh you don't know the power 
In what you're saying 
Oh ... 
And so he froze where he stood 
And he looked to the ground 
And he cried 
He cried 
People where 
I come from 
They survive without feelings or blood 
I never could 
Was stoned to death 
But I'm still living 
So he froze where he stood 
And he looked to the ground 
And he cried 
He cried 
So he froze 
And he looked, and he looked 
To the ground 
And he cried 
He cried

 

SORROW WILL COME IN THE END

Legalized theft 
Leaves me bereft 
I get it straight in the neck 
(Somehow expecting no less) 
A court of justice 
With no use for Truth 
Lawyer ...liar 
Lawyer ...liar 
You pleaded and squealed 
And you think you've won 
But Sorrow will come 
To you in the end 
And as sure as my words are pure 
I praise the day that brings you pain 
Q.C.'s obsessed with sleaze 
Frantic for Fame 
They're all on the game 
They just use a different name 
You lied 
And you were believed 
By a J.P. senile and vile 
You pleaded and squealed 
And you think you've won 
But Sorrow will come 
To you in the end 
And as sure as my words are pure 
I praise the day that brings you pain 
So don't close your eyes 
Don't close your eyes 
A man who slits throats 
Has time on his hands 
And I'm gonna get you 
So don't close your eyes 
Don't ever close your eyes 
You think you've won 
OH NO

 

SATAN REJECTED MY SOUL

Satan rejected my soul 
He knows my kind 
He won't be dragged down 
He's seen my face around 
He knows Heaven doesn't seem 
To be my home 
So I must find 
Somewhere else to go 
So I must find 
Somewhere else to go 
So, take it - please 
It's free 
You'll never see 
You'll never see 
All the fun in life it's cost me 
Satan rejected my soul 
As low as he goes 
He never quite goes this low 
He's seen my face around 
He knows Heaven doesn't seem 
To be my home 
So I must find 
Somewhere else to go 
So I must find 
Somewhere else to go 
So, take it please 
It's really sly 
Come on, come on, ah Come on, come on, come on 
Take it please, It's really sly 
Come on, come on, ah Come on, come on, come on 
Call me in, Pull me in, call me in 
Come on, come on, oh Come on, come on, come on 
Pull me in, pull me in, Call me in, haul me in, pull me in 
Come on, come on, ah, Come on, come on 
La la la la la, Oh ...

 
 REEL AROUND THE FOUNTAIN

It's time the tale was told
of how you took a child
and you made him old
Reel around the fountain
slap me on the patio
I'll take it now
Fifteen minutes with you
well, I wouldn't say no
people said that you were virtually dead
and they were so wrong
fifteen minutes with you
well, i wouldn't say no
people said that you were easily led
and they were half-right
I dreamt about you last night
and i fell out of bed twice
you can pin and mount me like a butterfly
but take me to the haven of your bed
was something that you never said
two lumps, please
you're the bee's knees
but so am I
Meet me at the fountain
shove me on the patio
I'll take it slowly
Fifteen minutes with you
oh I wouldn't say no
people see no worth in you
oh but I do

 

YOU'VE GOT EVERYTHING NOW

As merry as the days were long
I was right and you were wrong
back at the old grey school
I would win and you would lose
But you've got everything now
and what a terrible mess I've made of my life
No, I've never had a job
because I've never wanted one
I've seen you smile
but I've never really heard you laugh
So who is rich and who is poor?
I cannot say...
You are your mother's only son
and you're a desperate one
But I don't want a lover
I just want to be seen in the back of your car
A friendship sadly lost?
Well, this is true ...and yet, it's false
Did I ever tell you , by the way
I never did like your face
But you've got everything now
and what a terrible mess I've made of my life
No, I've never had a job
because I'm too shy
But I don't want a lover
I just want to be tied to the back of your car.

 

MISERABLE LIE

So, goodbye
please stay with your own kind
and I'll stay with mine
There's something against us
it's not time
So, goodbye
I know I hardly say
how much I love your casual way
but please put your tongue away
a little higher and we're well away
the dark nights are drawing in
and your humour is as black as them
I look at yours, you laugh at mine
and"love" is just a miserable lie
you have destroyed my flower like-life
not once-but twice
you have corrupt my innocent mind
not once-but twice
I know that wind-swept mystical air
it means: I'd like to see your underwear
I recognise that mystical air
it means: I'd like to see your underwear
what do we get for the trouble and pain?
just a rented room in Whalley Range
into the depths of the criminal world
I followed her...
I need advice, I need advice
because nobody ever looks at me twice
I'm just a country-mile behind
the world
I'm just a country mile behind
the whole world
so take me when you go

 

PRETTY GIRLS MAKE GRAVES

Upon the sand,upon the bay
"there is a quick and easy way" you say
before you illustrate
I'd rather state:
"I'm not the man you think I am
I'm not the man you think I am "
And Sorrow's native son
he will not smile for anyone
And pretty girls makes the graves
End of the pier, end of the bay
you tug my arm and say:"Give into lust,
give up to lust, oh heaven knows we'll
soon be dust..."
But I'm not the man you think I am
I'm not the man you think I am
And Sorrow's native son
he will not rise for anyone
And pretty girls make graves
I could have been wild and I could have been free
but Nature played this trick on me
She wants it Now
and she will not wait
but she's too rough
and I'm too delicate
Then on the sand
another man, he takes her hand
and a smile lights up her stupid face
(and well, it would)
I lost my faith in Womanhood
I lost my faith in Womanhood, I lost my faith

 

THE HAND THAT ROCKS THE CRADLE

Please don't cry
the ghost and the storm outside
will not invade this sacred shire
nor infiltrate your mind
my life down I shall lie
if the bogey-man should try
to play tricks on your sacred mind
to tease, torment and tantalise
wavering shadows loom
a piano plays in an empty room
there'll be blood on the cleaver tonight
when darkness lifts and the room is bright
I'll still be by your side
for you are all that matters
and I'll love you till the day I die
there never need to be longing in your eyes
as long as the hand that rocks the cradle is mine
ceiling shadows shimmy by
and when the wardrobe towers like a beast of prey
there's a sadness in your beautiful eyes
you're untouched, unsoiled, wonderous eyes
my life down I shall lie
should restless spirts try
to play tricks on you sacred mind
but whom I never gave a name
I just looked into his wonderous eyes
and said" never never never again"
all too soon I did return
just like a moth to a flame
so rattle my bones all over the stones
because I'm only a beggar-man whom nobody owns
see how words as old as sin
fit me like a glove I'm here and here I'll stay
together we lie, together we pray
there never need be longing in your eyes
as long as the hand that rocks the cradle is mine

 

STILL ILL

I decree today that life
is simply taking and not giving
England is mine and it owes me a living
ask me why, and I'll spit in your eye
ask me why, and I'll spit in your eye
but we cannot cling to the old dreams anymore
no, we cannot cling to the old dreams anymore
Does the body rule the mind
or does the mind rule the body?
I dunno...
Under the iron bridge we kissed
and although I ended up with sore lips
it just wasn't like the old days anymore
no, it wasn't like those days
am I still ill?
Does the body rule the mind
or does the mind rule the body ?
I dunno...
Ask me why, and I'll die
ask me why, and I'll die
and if you must go to work tomorrow
well, if I were you I wouldn't bother
for there are brighter sides to life
and I should know because I've seen them
but not very often...
under the iron bridge we kissed
and although I ended up with sore lips
it just wasn't like the old days anymore
no, it wasn't like those days
am I still ill?

 

HAND IN GLOVE

Hand in glove
the sun shines out of our behinds
no, it's not like any other love
this one is different-because it's us
Hand in glove
we can go wherever we please
and everything depends upon
how near you stand to me
And if the people stare
then the people stare
I really don't know and I really don't care
Hand in glove
the Good People laugh
yes, we may be hidden by rags
but we have something they'll never have
So, hand in glove I stake my claim
I'll fight to the last breath
If they dare touch a hair on your head
I'll fight to the last breath
The Good Life is out there, somewhere
so stay on my arm, you little charmer
But I know my luck too well
and I'll probably never see you again.

 

WHAT DIFFERENCE DOES IT MAKE?

All men have secrets and here is mine
so let it be known
we have been through hell and high tide,
I can surely rely on you?
and yet you start to recoil,
heavy words are so lightly thrown
but still I'd leap in front of a flying bullet for you
So, what difference does it make?
so, what difference does it make?
it makes none
but you have gone
and you must be looking very old tonight
The devil will find work for idle hands to do
I stole and I lied, and why?
because you asked me to!
but now you make feel so ashamed
because I've only got two hands
well, I'm still fond of you
So, what difference does it make?
so, what difference does it make?
it makes none
but you have gone
and your prejudice won't keep you warm tonight
So, no more apologies
no more apologies
I'm too tired
I'm too sick and tired
and I'm feeling very sick and ill today
But I'm still fond of you

 

I DON'T OWE YOU ANYTHING

Bought on stolen wine
a nod was the first step
you know very well
what was coming next
did I really walk all this way
just to hear you say
"oh I don't want to go out tonight"
but you will
for you must
I don't owe you anything
but you owe me something
repay me now
you should never go to them
let them come to you
just like I do
you should not go to them
let them come to you
just like I do
Too freely on your lips
words prematurely said
oh but I know what will make you smile tonight
Life is never kind
life is never kind
oh but I know what will make you smile tonight

 

SUFFER LITTLE CHILDREN

Over the moors,take me to the moors
dig a shallow grave
and I'll lay me down
Lesley-Anne, with your pretty white beads
oh John, you'll never be a man
and you'll never see your home again
oh Manchester, so much to answer for
Edward, see those alluring lights?
tonight will be your very last night
a woman said "I know my son is dead
I'll never rest my hands on his scared head"
Hindley wakes and Hindley says:
"Wherever he has gone, I have gone "
But fresh lilaced moorland fields
cannot hide the stoild stench of death
Hindley wakes and Hindley says:
"Whatever he has done, I have done"
But this is no easy ride
for a child cries
"find me...find me, nothing more
we're on a sullen misty moor
we may be dead and we may be gone
but we will be right by your side
until the day you die
this is no easy ride
we will haunt you when you laugh
yes, you could say we're a team
you might sleep
BUT YOU WILL NEVER DREAM!"
Oh Manchester, so much to answer for
Oh Manchester, so much to answer for
Over the moor, I'm on the moor
the child is on the moor

 

THE HEADMASTER RITUAL

Belligerent ghouls
run Manchester schools
spineless swines
cemented mines
Sir leads the troops
jealous of youth
same old suit since 1962
he does the military two-step
down the nape of my neck
I wanna go home
I don't want to stay
give up education
is a bad mistake
mid-week on the playing fields
Sir thwacks you on the knees
knees you in the groin
elbow in the face
I wanna go home
I don't want to stay
Belligerent ghouls
run Manchester schools
spineless bastards all
Sir leads the troops
jealous of youth
same old jokes since 1902
he does the military two-step
down the nape of my neck
I wanna go home
I don't want to stay
give up life
as a bad mistake
please excuse me from gym
I've got this terrible cold coming on
he grabs and devours
he kicks me in the showers
kicks me in the showers
and he grabs and devours
I wanna go home
I don't want to stay

 

RUSHOLME RUFFIANS

The last night at the fair
by the big wheel generator
a boy is stabbed
and his money is grabbed
and the air hangs heavy like a dulling wine
she is famous
she is funny
an engagement ring
doesn't mean a thing
to a mind consumed by brass(money)
and though I walk home alone
my faith in love is still devout
the last night at the fair
from a seat on a whirling waltzer
her skirt ascends for a watching eye
it's a hideous trait( on her mother's side)
and though I walk home alone
my faith in love is still devout
then someone falls in love
and someone's beaten up
and the senses being dulled are mine
and someone falls in love
someone's beaten up
and the senses being dulled are mine
and though I walk home alone
my faith in love is still devout
this is the last night of the fair
and the grease in the hair
of a speedway operator
is all a tremulous heart requires
a schoolgirl is denied
she said "How quickly would I die
if I jumped from the top of the parachutes?"
this is the last night of the fair

scratch my name on your arm with a fountain pen

I WANT THE ONE I CAN'T HAVE

On the day that your mentality
catches up with your biology
I want the one I can't have
and it's driving me mad
it's written all over my face
A double-bed
and a stalwart lover, for sure
these are the riches of the poor
A double-bed
and a stalwart lover, for sure
these are the riches of the poor
a tough kid who sometimes swallows nails
raised on Prisoner's Aid
he killed a policeman when he was thirteen
and somehow that really impressed me
it's written all over my face
On the day that your mentality
catches up with your biology
And if you ever need self-validation
just meet me in the alley by the
railway-station
it's written all over my face

 

WHAT SHE SAID

What she said:
"How come someone hasn't noticed
that I'm dead
and decided to bury me
God knows, I'm ready"
What she said was
but then, all the rejection she's had
to pretend to be happy
could only be idiocy
What she said was not for the job or
lover that she never had
What she read
all heady books
she'd sit and prophesise
(it took a tattoed boy from Birkenhead
to really really open her eyes)

THAT JOKE ISN'T FUNNY ANYMORE

Park the car at the side of the road
you should know
time's tide will smother you
and I will too
when you laugh about other people who feel so
very lonely
their only desire is to die
well I'm afraid
it doesn't make me smile
I wish I could laugh
but that joke isn't funny anymore
it's too close to home and it's too near the bone
it's too close to home and it's too near the bone
more than you'll ever know
It was dark as I drove the point home
and on cold leather seats
well, it suddenly struck me
I just might die with a smile on my
face after all
I've seen this happen in other people's lives
and now it's happening in mine

 

NOWHERE FAST

I'd like to drop my trousers to the world
I am a man of means(of slender means)
each household appliance
is like a new science in my town
and if a day came when I felt a natural emotion
I'd get such a shock I'd probably jump in the ocean
and when a train goes by
it's such a sad sound
I'd like to drop my trousers to the Queen
every sensible child will know what this means
the poor and the needy
are selfish and greedy on her terms
and if the day came when I felt a natural emotion
I'd get such a shock I'd probably jump in the ocean
and when a train goes by
it's such a sad song
And when I'm lying in my bed
I think about life
and I think about death
and neither one particularly appeals to me
and if the day came when I felt a natural emotion
I'd get such a shock I'd probably lie
in the middle of the street and die
I'd lie down and die

 

WELL I WONDER

Well I wonder
do you hear me when you sleep?
I hoarsely cry
Well I wonder
do you see me when we pass?
I half-die
Please keep me in mind
please keep me in mind
Gasping-but somehow still alive
this is the fierce last stand of all I am
Gasping-dying-but somehow still alive
this is the final stand of all I am
Please keep me in mind

 

BARBARISM BEGINS AT HOME

Unruly boys
who will not grow up
must be taken in hand
Unruly girls
who will not settle down
they must be taken in hand
A crack on the head
is what you get for not asking
and a crack on the head
is what you get for asking

 

MEAT IS MURDER

Heifer whines could be human cries
closer comes the screaming knife
this beautiful creature must die
this beautiful creature must die
a death for no reason
and death for reason is MURDER
and the flesh you so fancifully fry
is not succulent, tasty or nice
it's death for no reason
and death for no reason is MURDER
and the calf that you carve with a smile
is MURDER
and the turkey you festively slice
is MURDER
do you know how animals die?
kitchen aroma aren't very homely
it's not "comforting," "cheery" or kind
it's sizzling blood and the unholy stench
of MURDER
it's not "natural," "normal" or kind
the fleas you so fancifully fry
as you savour the flavour
of MURDER
NO, NO, NO, IT'S MURDER
NO, NO, NO, IT'S MURDER
who hears when animals cry?

 

THE QUEEN IS DEAD

Farewell to this lands cheerless marches
hemmed in like a boar between arches
her very Lowness with her head in a sling
Im truely sorry-but it sounds like a wonderful thing
dear Charles, dont you ever crave
to appear on the front of the Daily mail
dressed in your Mother's bridal veil?
So, I checked all the registered historical facts
and I was shocked into shame to discover
how Im the 18th pale descendent
of some, old queen or other
has the world changed, or have I changed?
has the world changed, or have I changed?
as some 9-year old tough peddles drugs
(I never even knew what drugs were)
And so, I broke into the Palace
with a sponge and a rusty spanner
she said: "Eh, I know you, and you cannot sing"
I said: "that's nothing -you should hear me play piano"
We can go for a walk where it's quiet and dry
and we can talk about precious things
but when you are tied to your mother's apron
not one talks about castration
We can go for a walk where it's quiet and dry
and we can talk about precious things
like love and law and poverty
these are the things that kill me
We can go for a walk where it's quiet and dry
and we can talk about precious things
but the rain that flattens my hair
theses are the things that kill me
Passed the Pub that saps your body
and the church who'll snatch your money
the Queen is dead, boys
and it's so lonely on a limb
Pass the Pub that wrecks your body
and the church-all they want is your money
the Queen is dead, boys`
you can trust me, boys
life is very long, when you're lonely
life is very long, when you're lonely...

 

FRANKLY MR.SHANKLY

Frankly, Mr Shankly, this position Ive held
it pays my way, but it corrodes my soul
I want to leave you will not miss me
I want to go down in musical history
Frankly, Mr Shankly, Im a sickening wreck
Ive got the 21st Century breathing down my neck
I must move fast, you understand me
I want to go down in celluloid history
Fame, Fame, fatal Fame
it can play hideous tricks on the brain
but still I rather be Famous
than righteous or holy, any day
but sometimes Id feel more fulfilled
making Christmas cards with the mentally ill
I want to Live and I want to Love
I want to catch something that I might be ashamed of
Frankly, Mr Shankly, this position I've held
it pays my way and it corrodes my soul
oh, I didnt realise that you wrote poetry
(I didnt realise you wrote such bloody awful poetry)
Frankly, Mr Shankly, since you ask
you are a flatulent pain the arse
I do not mean to be so rude
but still, I must speck frankly, Mr Shankly

 

I KNOW IT'S ALL OVER

Oh Mother, I can fell the soil falling over my head
and as i climb into an empty bed
Oh well, Enough said
I know it's over-still I cling
I don't know where else I can go
Oh Mother, I can feel the soil falling over my head
see, the sea want s to take me
the knife wants to cut me
do you think you can help me?
Sad veiled bride, please be happy
handsome groom, give her room
loud, loutish lover, treat her kindly
(although she needs you
more than she loves you)
and I know it's over
and it never really began
but in my heart it was so real
and you even spoke to me and said:
"If you're so funny
then why are you on your own tonight?
and if you are so clever
then why are you on your own tonight?
if you're so terribly good looking
then why do you sleep alone tonight?
because tonight is just like any other night
that's why you're on your own tonight
with your triumphs and your charms
while they are in each other's arms.."
It's so easy to laugh
it's so easy to hate
it takes strength to be gentle and kind
It's so easy to laugh
it's so easy to hate
it takes guts to be gentle and kind
love is Natural and Real
but not for you, my love
not tonight my love
love is Natural and Real
but not for such as you and I, my love
Oh Mother, I can fell the soil falling over my head
Oh Mother, I can fell the soil falling over my head...

 

NEVER HAD NO ONE EVER

When you walk without ease
on these
the very streets where you were raised
I had a really bad dream
it lasted 20 years, 7 months, and 27 days
Never had no one ever.

 

CEMETERY GATES

A dreaded sunny day
so I meet you at the cemetry gates
Keats and Yeats are on your side
A dreaded sunny day
so I meet you at the cemetry gates
Keats and Yeats are on your side
while Wilde is on mine
So we go inside and we gravely read the stones
all those people all those lives
where are they now ?
with loves, and hates
and passions just like mine
they were born
and then they lived and then they died
which seems so unfair
and I wantr to crv
You say: "ere thrice the sun hath done salutation to the dawn"
and you claim these words as your own
but Im well-read, have heard them said
a hundred times (maybe less, maybe more)
if you must write prose/poems
the words you use should be your own
dont plagiarise or take "on loans"
there's alweays someone, somewhere
with a big nose, who knows
and who trips you up and laughs
when you fall
You say: "ere long done do does did "
words which could only be your own
you then produce the text
from whence was ripped
(some dizzy whore, 1804)
A dreaded sunny day
so let's go where we're happy
so I meet you at the cemetry gates
Keats and Yeats are on your side
A dreaded sunny day
so let's go where we're wanted
so I meet you at the cemetry gates
Keats and Yeats are on your side
but you lose
because Wilde is on mine

 

BIGMOUTH STRIKES AGAIN

Sweetness, sweetness I was only joking
when I said Id like to smash every tooth
in your head
Sweetness, sweetness I was only joking
when I said by right s you should be
bludgeoned in your bed
and now I know how Joan of Arc felt
now I know how Joan of Arc felt
as the flames roseto her roman nose
and her Walkman stared to melt
Bibmouth, bigmouth
bigmouth strikes again
and Ive got no right to take my place
with the Human race
and now I know how Joan of Arc felt
now I know of Joan of Arc felt
as the flames rose to her roman nose
and her hearing aid started to melt
Bigmouth, bigmouth
bigmouth strikes again
and Ive got no right to take my place
with the Human race

 

THE BOY WITH A THORN IN HIS SIDE

The boy with the thorn in his side
behind the hatred there lies
a murderous desire for love
how can they look into my eyes
and still they dont believe me
how can they hear me say those words
and still they dont believe me
and if they don't believe me now
will they ever believe me?
and if they don't believe me now
will they ever believe me?
The boy with the thorn in his side
behind the hatred there lies
a plundering desire for love
how can they see the Love in our eyes
and still they don't believe us
and after all this time
they don't want to believe us
and if they dont believe us now
will they ever believe us ?
andd when you want to Live
how do you start ?
where do you go ?
who do you know?

 

VICAR IN A TUTU

I was minding mind business
lifting some lead off
the roof of the Holy Name church
it was worthwhile living a laughable life
just to set my eyes on a blistering sight
of a vicar in a tu-tu
he's not strange
he just wants to live his life this way
a scanty bit of a thing
with a decorative ring
that wouldn't cover the head of a child
as Rose collects the money in the cannister
who comes sliding down the bannister
the vicar in a tu-tu
he's not strange
he just wants to live his life this way
the monkish monsignor
with a head full of plaster
said "my man, get your vile soul dry-cleaned"
as Rose counts the money in the cannister
as natural as rain
he dances again
vicar in a tu-tu
The next day in the pulpit
with Freedom and Ease
combating ignoranca,dust and disease
as Rose counts the money in the cannister
as natural as rain
he dances again
the fabric of a tu-tu
any man could get us to
and I am a living sign.

 

THERE IS A LIGHT THAT NEVER GOES OUT

Take me out tonight
where there's music and there's people
who are young and alive
driving in your car
I never never want to go home
because I havent got one
anymore
take me out tonight
because I want to see people and I
want to see lights
driving in your car
oh please dont drop me home
because it's not my home, it's their
home, and Im welcome no morw
and if a double-decker bus
crashes in to us
to die by your side
such a heavenly way to die
and if a ten ton truck
kills the both of us
to die by your side
the pleasure and the privilege is mine
take me out tonight
oh take me anywhere, I dont care
and in the darken underpass
I thought Oh God, my chance has come at last
(but then a strange fear gripped me and I just couldn't ask)
take me out tonight
take me anywhere, I dont care
just driving in your car
I never never want to go home
because I havent got one
I havent got one.

 

SOME GIRLS ARE BIGGER THAN OTHERS

From the ice-age to the dole-age
there is but one concern
and I have just discover
some girls are bigger than others
some girls are bigger than others
some girls mothers are bigger than
other girls mothers
As Anthony said to Cleopatra
as he opened a crate of ale:
some girls are bigger than others
some girls are bigger than others
some girls mothers are bigger than
other girls mothers.

 

A RUSH AND A PUSH AND AND THE LAND IS OURS

HELLO
I am the ghost of Troubled Joe
hung by his pretty white neck
some eighteen months ago
I travelled to a mystical time zone
but I missed my bed
so I soon came home
they said:
"there's too much caffeine
in your bloodstream
and a lack of real spice
in your life"
I said:
"leave me alone
because I'm alright, dad
just surprised to still
be on my own...."
Ooh, but don't mention love
I'd hate the real strain of the pain again
a rush and a push and the land that
we stand on is ours
it has been before
so it shall be again
and people who are uglier than you and I
they take what they need, and leave
Ooh, but don't mention love
I'd hate the pain and the strain all over again
a rush and a push and the land that
we stand on is ours
it has been before
so why can't it be now?
and people who are weaker than you and I
they take what they want from life
Ooh, but don't mention love
no - just don't mention love!
a rush and a push and the land that
we stand on is ours
your youth may be gone
but you're still a young man
so phone me, phone me, phone me
so phone me, phone me, phone me
Ooh, I think I'm in love...
Urrgh, I think I'm in lerv

 

I STARTED SOMETHING I COULDN'T FINISH

The lanes were silent
with nothing or no one around for miles
I doused our friendly venture
with a hard-faced
three-word gesture
I started something
I forced you into a zone
and you were clearly
never meant to go
hair brushed and parted
typical me, typical me, typical me
I started something
...and now I'm not too sure
I grabbed you by the guilded beams
that's what Tradition means
and I doused another venture
with a gesture
that was...absolutely vile
I started something
forced you to a zone
and you were clearly
never meant to go
hair brushed and parted
typical me, typical me, typical me
I started something
...and now I'm not too sure
I grabbed you by the guilded beams
that's what Tradition means
and now eighteen months' hard-labour
seems...fair enough
I started something
forced you to a zone
and you were clearly
never meant to go
hair brushed and parted
typical me, typical me, typical me
I started something
and now I'm not too sure

 

DEATH OF A DISCO DANCER

The death of a disco dancer
well, it happens a lot 'round here
and if you think Peace
is a common goal
well, that goes to show
just how little you know
The death of a disco dancer
well, I'd rather not get involved
I never talk to my neighbour
I'd just rather not get involved
Love, peace and harmony?
Love, peace and harmony?
Oh, very nice, very nice, very nice, very nice
...but maybe in the next world.

 

GIRLFRIEND IN A COMA

Girlfriend in a coma, I know
I know - it's serious
Girlfriend in a coma, I know
I know - it's really serious
there wree times when I could
have 'murdered' her
(but, you know, I would hate
anything to happen to her)
NO, I DON'T WANT TO SEE HER
Do you really think
she'll pull through?
Do you really think
she'll pull through?
Girlfriend in a coma, I know
I know, it's serious
there were time when I could
have 'strangeled' her
(but, you know, I would hate
anything to happen to her)
WOULD YOU PLEASE LET ME SEE HER!
Do you really think she'll pull through?
Do you really think she'll pull through?
Let me wisper my last goodbyes
I know - IT'S SERIOUS

 

STOP ME IF YOU'VE HEARD THIS ONE BEFORE

Stop me, stop me,
stop me if you think that you've heard this one before
stop me, stop me
stop me if you think that you've heard this one before
nothing's changed
I still love you, oh I still love you
...only slightly less than I used to
I was delayed, I was way-laid
an emergency stop
I smelt the last ten seconds of life
I crashed down on the crossbar
and the pain was enough to make
a shy, bald buddhist reflect
and plan a mass-murder
who said I'd lied to her?
who said I'd lied because I never
who said I'd lied because I never
I was detained, I was restrained
he broke my spleen
he broke my knees
(and then he really laid into me)
Friday night in Out-patients
who said I'd lied to her?
who said I'd lied - because I never
who said I'd lied - because I never
Oh, so I drank one
or was it four
and when I fell on the floor
...I drank more
stop me, stop me
stop me if you think that you've heard this one before
nothing's changed
I still love you, I still love you
but only slightly
less than I used to

 

LAST NIGHT I DREAMT THAT SOMEBODY LOVED ME

Last night I dreamt
that somebody loved me
no hope - but no harm
just another false alarm
Las night I felt
real arms around me
no hope - no harm
just another false alarm
so, tell me how long
before the last one?
and tell me how long
before the right one?
this story is old - I KNOW
but it goes on
this story is old - I KNOW
but it goes on

 

UNHAPPY BIRTHDAY

I've come to wish you an unhappy birthday
I've come to wish you an unhappy birthday
because you're evil
and you lie
and if you should die
I may feel slightly sad
(but I won't cry)
Loved and lost
and some may say
when usually its Nothing
surely you're happy
it should be this way?
I say "No, I'm gonna kill my dog"
and: "May the lines sag heavy
and deep tonight XXX"
I've come to wish you an unhappy birthday
I've come to wish you an unhappy birthday
because you're evil
and you lie
and if you should die
I may feel slightly sad
(But I won't cry)
Loved and lost
some people say
when usually its Nothing
surely you're happy
it should be this way?
I said "No"
and then I shot myself
so, drink, drink, drink
and be ill tonight
from the one you left behind
from the one you left behind...

 

PAINT A VULGAR PICTURE

At the record company meeting
On their hands - a dead star
and ooh, the plans that they weave
and ooh, the sikening greed
At the record company meeting
on their hands - a dead star
the sycophantic slags all say:
"I knew him first, and I knew him well"
Re-issue! Re-package! Re-package!
Re-evaluate the songs
double-pack with a photograph
Extra Track (and a tacky badge)
A-list, playlist
"Please them, please them!"
"Please them! Please them!"
(sadly, THIS was your life)
but you could have said no
if you'd wanted to
you could have said no
if you'd wanted to
BPI, MTV, BBC
"Please them! Please them!"
(sadly this was your life)
but you could have said no
if you'd wanted to
you could have walked away
...couldn't you?
I touched you at the soundcheck
you had no real way of knowing
in my heart I bgged "please, take
me with you...
I don't care where you're going"
But to you I was faceless
I was fawning, I was boring
just a child from those ugly new houses
who could never begin to know
who could never really know
Best of? Most of?
Satiate the need
slip them into different sleeves!
Buy both, and be decieved
climber - new entry, re-entry
World tour! ("media whore")
"Please the Press in Belgium!"
(THIS was your life...)
and when it fails to recoup?
Well, maybe:
You just haven't earned it yet, baby
I walked a pace behind you at the soundcheck
you're just the same as I am
what makes most people feel happy
leads us headlong into harm
so, in my bedroom in those 'ugly new houses'
I dance my legs down to the knees
but me and my 'true love'
we will never meet again...
At the record company meeting
on their hands - at last! - a dead star!
but they cannot taint you in my eyes
no, they cannout touch you now
No, they cannot hurt you my darling
they cannot touch you now
but me and my 'true love'
will never meet again

 

DEATH AT ONE'S ELBOW

Ooh Glenn, don't come to the house tonight
Ooh, Glenn, don't come to the house tonight
because there's somebody here
who really really loves you
stay home
be bored
(it's crap, I KNOW)
Ooh, Glenn, don't come to the house tonight
Ooh, Glen, don't come to the house tonight
because there's somebody here
who'll take a hatchet to your ear
how the frustration renders me
hateful, Glenn!
don't come to the house tonight
don't come to the house tonight
because you'll slip on the
trail of my bespattered remains
and so, that's why
GOODBYE MY LOVE, GOODBYE MY LOVE, GOODBYE MY LOVE...
Belch

 

I WON'T SHARE YOU

I won't share you
I won't share you
with the drive and ambition
and the zeal I feel
this is my time
as the note I wrote
was read, she said
has the Perrier gone
straight to my head
or is life plainly sick and cruel, instead?
"YES!"
No-no-no-no-no-no
I won't share you
I won't share you
with the drive and the dreams inside
this is my time
Life tends to come and go
well, that's OK
just as long as you know
Life tends to come and go
well, that's OK
just as long as you know
I won't share you
I won't share you
with the drive and the dreams inside
this is my time, this is my time


THE QUEEN IS DEAD

Farewell to this lands cheerless marches
hemmed in like a boar between arches
her very Lowness with her head in a sling
Im truely sorry-but it sounds like a wonderful thing
dear Charles, dont you ever crave
to appear on the front of the Daily mail
dressed in your Mother's bridal veil?
So, I checked all the registered historical facts
and I was shocked into shame to discover
how Im the 18th pale descendent
of some, old queen or other
has the world changed, or have I changed?
has the world changed, or have I changed?
as some 9-year old tough peddles drugs
(I never even knew what drugs were)
And so, I broke into the Palace
with a sponge and a rusty spanner
she said: "Eh, I know you, and you cannot sing"
I said: "that's nothing -you should hear me play piano"
We can go for a walk where it's quiet and dry
and we can talk about precious things
but when you are tied to your mother's apron
not one talks about castration
We can go for a walk where it's quiet and dry
and we can talk about precious things
like love and law and poverty
these are the things that kill me
We can go for a walk where it's quiet and dry
and we can talk about precious things
but the rain that flattens my hair
theses are the things that kill me
Passed the Pub that saps your body
and the church who'll snatch your money
the Queen is dead, boys
and it's so lonely on a limb
Pass the Pub that wrecks your body
and the church-all they want is your money
the Queen is dead, boys`
you can trust me, boys
life is very long, when you're lonely
life is very long, when you're lonely...

 

PANIC

Panic on the streets of London
Panic on the streets of Birmingham
I wonder to myself
Could life ever be sane again
on the Leeds side-streets that you slip down
I wonder to myself
Hopes may rise on the Grasmeres
But Honey Pie, you're not safe here
So you run down
To the safety of the town
But there's Panic on the streets of Carlisle
Dublin, Dundee, Humberside
I wonder to myself
Burn down the Disco
Hang the blessed D.J.
Because the music that they constantly play
IT SAYS NOTHING TO ME ABOUT MY LIFE
Hang the blessed D.J.
Because the music they constantly play
On the Leeds side-streets that you slip down
On the provincial towns that you jog 'round
Hang the D.J.,. Hang the D.J.,.Hang the D.J...

 

VICAR IN A TUTU

I was minding mind business
lifting some lead off
the roof of the Holy Name church
it was worthwhile living a laughable life
just to set my eyes on a blistering sight
of a vicar in a tu-tu
he's not strange
he just wants to live his life this way
a scanty bit of a thing
with a decorative ring
that wouldn't cover the head of a child
as Rose collects the money in the cannister
who comes sliding down the bannister
the vicar in a tu-tu
he's not strange
he just wants to live his life this way
the monkish monsignor
with a head full of plaster
said "my man, get your vile soul dry-cleaned"
as Rose counts the money in the cannister
as natural as rain
he dances again
vicar in a tu-tu
The next day in the pulpit
with Freedom and Ease
combating ignoranca,dust and disease
as Rose counts the money in the cannister
as natural as rain
he dances again
the fabric of a tu-tu
any man could get us to
and I am a living sign.

 

ASK

Shyness is nice, but
Shyness can stop you
From doing all the things in life
That you'd like to
So, if there's something you'd like to try
ASK ME-I WON'T SAY "NO"-HOW COULD I?
Coyness is nice, but ,
Coyness can stop you
from saying all the things in
life that you want to
If there's something that you'd like to try
ASK ME-I WON'TSAY"NO"-HOW COULD I?
Spending warm, Summer days indoors
Writing fringhtening verse
To a buck-toothed girl in Luxembourg
ASK ME, ASK ME ,ASK ME, ASK ME, ASK ME ,ASK ME
Because if it's not Love
Then it's the Bomb
That will bring us together
Nature is a language-can't you read?
Nature is a language-can't you read?
ASK ME, ASK ME ,ASK ME, ASK ME, ASK ME ,ASK ME
Because if it's not Love
Then it's the Bomb
That will bring us together

 

MARIE'S THE NAME (HIS LATEST FLAME) / RUSHOLME RUFFIANS

Very old friend 
Came by today 
As he was telling everyone in town 
Of all the love that he'd just found 
And Marie's the name (of his latest flame) 
Talked and talked 
And I heard him say 
That she had the longest blackest hair 
Prettiest green eyes anywhere 
And Marie's the name (of his latest flame) 
The last night of the fair 
By the big wheel generator 
A boy is stabbed 
His money is grabbed 
And the air hangs heavy like a dulling wine 
She is Famous 
She is Funny 
An engagement ring 
Doesn't mean a thing 
To a mind consumed by brass (money), oh 
The last night of the fair 
From a seat on a whirling waltzer 
Her skirt ascends for a watching eye 
It's a hideous trait (on her mother's side)
From a seat on a whirling waltzer 
Her skirt ascends for a watching eye 
A hideous trait (on her mother's side) 
Then someone falls in love 
Someone's beaten up 
Someone's beaten up 
And the senses being dulled are mine 
And someone falls in love 
Someone's beaten up 
And the senses being dulled are mine 
This is the last night of the fair 
And the grease in the hair 
Of a speedway operator 
Is all a tremulous heart requires 
A schoolgirl is denied 
She said : "How quickly would I die 
If I jumped from the top of the parachutes ?"
This is the last night of the fair 
And the grease in the hair 
Of a speedway operator 
Is all a tremulous heart requires 
A schoolgirl is denied 
She said : "How quickly would I die 
Oh, if I jumped from the top of the parachutes ?"
...Oh, walk home alone 
I might walk home alone 
But my faith in love is still devout

 

THE BOY WITH THE THORN IN HIS SIDE

The boy with the thorn in his side
behind the hatred there lies
a murderous desire for love
how can they look into my eyes
and still they dont believe me
how can they hear me say those words
and still they dont believe me
and if they don't believe me now
will they ever believe me?
and if they don't believe me now
will they ever believe me?
The boy with the thorn in his side
behind the hatred there lies
a plundering desire for love
how can they see the Love in our eyes
and still they don't believe us
and after all this time
they don't want to believe us
and if they dont believe us now
will they ever believe us ?
andd when you want to Live
how do you start ?
where do you go ?
who do you know?

 

RUBBER RING / WHAT SHE SAID

Yeah! What she says : 
"How come someone hasn't noticed 
That I'm dead 
And decided to bury me ? 
God knows, I'm ready !"
La-la-la ... 
What she said was sad 
But then, all the rejection she's had 
To pretend to be happy 
Could only be idiocy 
La-la-la ... 
What she said was not for the job or 
Lover that she never had 
No no no ... 
What she read 
All heady books 
She'd sit and prophesise 
(It took a tattooed boy from 
Birkenhead 
To really really open her eyes)
What she read 
All heady books 
She'd sit and prophesise 
(It took a tattooed boy from 
Birkenhead 
To really really open her eyes)
What she said : 
"I smoke because I'm hoping for an 
Early death 
AND I NEED TO CLING TO SOMETHING !"
What she said : 
"I smoke because I'm hoping for an 
Early death 
AND I NEED TO CLING TO SOMETHING !"
No no no no ...

 

IS IT REALLY SO STRANGE?

I left the North 
I travelled South 
I found a tiny house 
And I can't help the way I feel 
Oh yes, you can kick me 
And you can punch me 
And you can break my face 
But you won't change the way I feel 
'Cause I love you, Oh ... 
And is it really so strange ? 
Oh, is it really so strange ? 
Oh, is it really so, really so strange ? 
I say NO, you say YES 
(and you will change your mind) 
I left the South 
I travelled North 
I got confused - I killed a horse 
I can't help the way I feel 
Oh yes, you can punch me 
And you can butt me 
And you can break my spine 
But you won't change the way I feel 
'Cause I love you, Oh ... 
And is it really so strange ? 
Oh, is it really so strange ? 
Oh, is it really so, really so strange ? 
I say NO, you say YES 
(But you will change your mind) 
I left the North again 
I travelled South again 
And I got confused - I killed a nun 
I CAN'T HELP THE WAY I FEEL 
(I lost my bag in Newport Pagnell) 
Why is the last mile the hardest mile ? 
My throat was dry, with the sun in my eyes 
And I realised, I realised 
I could never 
I could never, never, never, go back home again

 

CEMETERY GATES

A dreaded sunny day
so I meet you at the cemetry gates
Keats and Yeats are on your side
A dreaded sunny day
so I meet you at the cemetry gates
Keats and Yeats are on your side
while Wilde is on mine
So we go inside and we gravely read the stones
all those people all those lives
where are they now ?
with loves, and hates
and passions just like mine
they were born
and then they lived and then they died
which seems so unfair
and I wantr to crv
You say: "ere thrice the sun hath done salutation to the dawn"
and you claim these words as your own
but Im well-read, have heard them said
a hundred times (maybe less, maybe more)
if you must write prose/poems
the words you use should be your own
dont plagiarise or take "on loans"
there's alweays someone, somewhere
with a big nose, who knows
and who trips you up and laughs
when you fall
You say: "ere long done do does did "
words which could only be your own
you then produce the text
from whence was ripped
(some dizzy whore, 1804)
A dreaded sunny day
so let's go where we're happy
so I meet you at the cemetry gates
Keats and Yeats are on your side
A dreaded sunny day
so let's go where we're wanted
so I meet you at the cemetry gates
Keats and Yeats are on your side
but you lose
because Wilde is on mine

 

LONDON

Smoke
Lingers 'round your fingers
Train
Heave on - to Euston
Do you think you've made
The right decision this time?
You left
Your tired family grieving
And you think they're sad because you're leaving
But didn't you see the Jealousy in the eyes
Of the ones who had to stay behind?
And do you think you've made
The right decision thins time?
You left
Your girlfriend on the platform
With thei really ragged notion that you'll return
But she knows
That when he goes
He really goes
So do you think you've made
The right decision this time?

 

I KNOW IT'S OVER

I can feel the soil falling over my head 
And as I climb into an empty bed 
Oh well. Enough said. 
I know it's over - still I cling 
I don't know where else I can go 
Over ... 
Oh Mother, I can feel the soil falling over my head 
See, the sea wants to take me 
The knife wants to cut me 
Do you think you can help me ? 
Sad veiled bride, please be happy 
Handsome groom, give her room 
Loud, loutish lover, treat her kindly 
(Though she needs you 
More than she loves you) 
And I know it's over - still I cling 
I don't know where else I can go 
Over, it's over, it's over, it's over 
It's over, la ... 
I know it's over 
And it never really began 
But in my heart it was so real
And you even spoke to me, and said : 
"If you're so funny 
Then why are you on your own tonight ? 
And if you're so clever 
Then why are you on your own tonight ? 
I know ... 
'Cause tonight - it's just like any other night 
That's why you're on your own tonight 
Your triumphs and your charms 
While they're in each other's arms..."
It's so easy to laugh 
It's so easy to hate 
It takes strength to be gentle and kind 
Over, over, over, over 
It's so easy to laugh 
It's so easy to hate 
It takes guts to be gentle and kind 
Over, over 
Love is Natural and Real 
But not for you, my love 
Not tonight, my love 
Love is Natural and Real 
But not for such as you and I, my love 
Oh Mother, I can feel the soil falling over my head...
Oh Mother, I can feel the soil fall over, fall over my head 
Oh Mother, I can feel the ... fall over my ... , Oh ...

 

THE DRAIZE TRAIN

A vastly superior version of the instrumental B-side, acting as a peace 
offering to Marr (Morrissey chose the tracks for the compilation, 
and of course, receives no royalties on this track).

 

STILL ILL

I decree today that life
is simply taking and not giving
England is mine and it owes me a living
ask me why, and I'll spit in your eye
ask me why, and I'll spit in your eye
but we cannot cling to the old dreams anymore
no, we cannot cling to the old dreams anymore
Does the body rule the mind
or does the mind rule the body?
I dunno...
Under the iron bridge we kissed
and although I ended up with sore lips
it just wasn't like the old days anymore
no, it wasn't like those days
am I still ill?
Does the body rule the mind
or does the mind rule the body ?
I dunno...
Ask me why, and I'll die
ask me why, and I'll die
and if you must go to work tomorrow
well, if I were you I wouldn't bother
for there are brighter sides to life
and I should know because I've seen them
but not very often...
under the iron bridge we kissed
and although I ended up with sore lips
it just wasn't like the old days anymore
no, it wasn't like those days
am I still ill?

 

BIGMOUTH STRIKES AGAIN

Sweetness, sweetness I was only joking
when I said Id like to smash every tooth
in your head
Sweetness, sweetness I was only joking
when I said by right s you should be
bludgeoned in your bed
and now I know how Joan of Arc felt
now I know how Joan of Arc felt
as the flames roseto her roman nose
and her Walkman stared to melt
Bibmouth, bigmouth
bigmouth strikes again
and Ive got no right to take my place
with the Human race
and now I know how Joan of Arc felt
now I know of Joan of Arc felt
as the flames rose to her roman nose
and her hearing aid started to melt
Bigmouth, bigmouth
bigmouth strikes again
and Ive got no right to take my place
with the Human race

 
ALSATIAN COUSTIN

Were you and he Lovers?
and would you say so if you were?
on a forecourt
on a Friday
passing my way
Were you and he Lovers?
and if you were, then say that you were!
on a groundsheet
under canvas
with your tent-flap
open wide
A note upon his desk:
"P.S. Bring Me Home And Have Me!"
Leather elbows on a tweed coat
- Oh! -
Is THAT the best you can do?
So came his reply:
"...but on the desk is where I want you!"
So I ask (even though I know):
were you and he Lovers?

 

LITTLE MAN, WHAT NOW?

An afternoon nostalgia
television show
you spoke in silhouette
(but they couldn't name you)
although the panel were
very polite to you
but I remembered you
from Friday nights 1969
ATV - you murdered every line
too old to be a child star
too young to take leads
four seasons passed
and they AXED you
nervously juvenile
(WON'T SMILE!)
What became of you?
did that swift eclipse torture you?
a star at eighteen
and then-suddenly gone
down to a few lines
in the back page of a teenage annual
oh but I remembered you
I looked up to you

 

EVERYDAY IS LIKE SUNDAY

Trudging slowly over wet sand
back to the bench
where your clothes were stolen
this is the coastal town
that they forgot to close down
Armageddon - come Armageddon!
Come Armageddon! Come!
Everyday is like Sunday
everyday is silent and grey
Hide on the promenade
scratch out a postcard
"how I dearly with I was not here"
in the seaside town
...that they forgot to bomb
Come! Come! Come - nuclear bomb!
Everyday is like Sunday
everyday is silent and grey
Trudging back over pebbles and sand
and a strange dust lands on your hands
(and on your face)
Everyday is like Sunday
"Win Yourself A Cheap Tray"
share some greased tea with me
everyday is silent and grey

 

BENGALI IN PLATFORMS

No no no
he does not want to depress you
oh no no no no no
he only wants to impress you
Bengali in platform
she only wants to embrace your culture
and to be your friend forever
Bengali, Bengali
oh shelve your Western plans
and understand that life is hard enough when you belong here
A silver-studded rim that glistens
and an ankle-star that...blinds me
a lemon sole so very high
which only reminds me, to tell you
so I break the news gently
I break the news to you gently
"Shelve your plans"
Bengali, Bengali
its the touchy march of time
that blinds you
don't blame me
don't hate me
just because I'm the one to tell you
that life is hard enough when you belong here
life is hard enough when you belong here
shelve your western plans
life is hard enough when you belong here

 

ANGEL, ANGEL, DOWN WE GO TOGETHER

Angel, Angel
don't take your life tonight
I know they take
and that they take in turn
and they give you nothing real
for yourself in return
and when they've used you
and they've broken you
and wasted all your money
and cast your shell aside
and when they've bought you
and they've sold you
and they've billed you for the pleasure
and they've made your parents cry
I will be here
BELIEVE ME
I will be here
...believe me
Angel, don't take your life
some people have got no pride
they do not understand
the Urgency of life
but I love you more than life
I love you more than life
I love you more than life
I love you more than life

 

LALE NIGHT, MAUDLIN STREET

The last night on Maudlin Street
goodbye house
goodbye stairs
I was born here
I was raised here, and
...I took some stick here
love at first sight
may sound trite
but it's true, you know
I could list the details
of everything you ever wore
or said, or how you stood that day
and as we spend the last night
on Maudlin Street, I say
"goodbye house-forever!"
I never stole a happy hour
around here
Where the world's ugliest boy
became what you see
here I am - the ugliest man
Its the last night on Maudlin Street
and truly I do love you
oh, truly I do love you
When I sleep with that picture of
you framed beside my bed
oh, it's childish and it's silly
but I think it's you in my room
by the bed (...yes, I told you it was silly...)
and I know
I took strange pills
but I never meant to hurt you
oh truly I love you
I came home late one night
everyone had gone to bed
nobody stays up for you
when you have sixteen stitches
all around your head
the last buss I missed to Maudlin Street
so, he drove me home in the Van
complaining: "Women only like me for my mind..."
don't leave your torch behind
power-cuts ahead
as we crept through the park
but no I cannot steal a pair of jeans
off a clothesline for you
but you...without clothes
oh I could not keep a straight face
me - without clothes?
well a nation turns its back and gags...
I'm packed
I am moving house
a half-life disappears today
every slag waves me on
(secretly wishing me gone
well, I will be soon
oh - I will be soon)
There were bad times on Maudlin Street
when they took you away in a police car
dear Inspector - don't you know?
don't you care?
don't you know - about Love?
Your gran died
and your mother died
on Maudlin Street
in pain and ashamed
with never time to say
those special things
I took the keys from Maudlin Street
well, it's only bricks and mortar!
and...truly I do love you
wherever you are
wherever you are

 

SUEDHEAD

Why do you come here
why do you hang around
I'm so sorry
I'm so sorry
Why do you come here
when you know it makes
things hard for me
when you know, oh
why do you come?
Why do you telephone?
and why send me silly notes?
I'm so sorry
I'm so sorry
why do you come here
when you know it makes
thing hard for me
when you know, oh
why do you come?
You had to sneak into my room
'just' to read my diary
was it just to see all the things
you knew I'd written about you?
and...so many illustrations
I'm so very sickened
oh, I am so sickened NOW

 

BREAK UP THE FAMILY

The strange logic of your clumsiest line
stayed emblazoned on my mind
break up the family
and lets begin to live our lives
I went to see all my friends tonight
it wasn't Youth, it wasn't even Life
born Old, sadly wise
resigned (well, we were)
to ending our lives
I'm so glad to grow older
to move away from those awful times
I want to see all my friends tonight
Yes you found love but you weren't
at peace with your life
home late, full of Hate
despise the ties that bind
oh I'm so glad to grow older
to move away from those younger years
now I'm in love for the first time
and I don't feel bad
Let me see all my old friends
let me put my arm around them
because I really do love them
now, does that sound mad?
Captain of games, solid framed
I stood on the touchline
hailstones, driven home
in his car - no breaks? I don't mind
I'm just so glad to grow older
to move away from those darker years
I'm in love for the first time
and I don't feel bad
so wish me luck my friends
goodbye

 

HAIRDRESSER ON FIRE

Here is London
here is London
is it home of the free,
or what?
can you squeeze me
into an empty page of your diary
and psychologically save me
I've got faith in you
I sense the power
in the fingers
within an hour the power
can totally destroy me
or it could same my life
here is London
'home of the brash, outrageous
and free'
you are repressed
but you're remarkably dressed
is it Real?
but you're far to busy
busy scissors
busy clippers
hair dresser on fire
all around Sloane Square
and you're far too busy
to see me
"busy,busy"
hairdresser on fire
was a client over-cautious
he made you nervous
and when he said
"I'm gonna sue you"
I really felt for you
so can you squeeze me
into an empty page of your diary
and supernaturally change me
CHANGE ME, CHANGE ME

 

THE ORDINARY BOYS

Ordinary boys, happy knowing nothing
happy being no one, but themselves
Ordinary girls, supermarket clothes
who think it's very clever to be cruel to you
for you were so different
you stood all alone
and you knew
that it had to be so
avoiding ordinary boys
happy going nowhere, just around here
in their rattling cars
and ordinary girls
never seeing further
than the cold, small streets
that trap them
but you were so different
you had to say no
when those empty fools
tried to change you, and claim you
for the lair of their ordinary world
where they feel so lucky
so lucky, so lucky
with their lives laid out before them
they're so lucky, so lucky
so lucky, so lucky

 

I DON'T MIND IF YOU FORGET ME

I don't mind
I don't mind if you forget me
having learned my lesson
I never left an impression on anyone
so now you send me your hardened 'regards'
when once you'd send me 'love'
sincerely I must tell you
your mild 'best wishes'
they make me suspicious
but I don't mind
I don't mind if you forget me
having learned my lesson
I never left
an impression on anyone
the pressure to change, to move on
was strange
and very strong
so this is why I tell you
I really do understand
BYE BYE
I don't mind if you forget me
no no no no no no no
REJECTION IS ONE THING
BUT REJECTION FROM A FOOL
IS CRUEL
REJECTION IS ONE THING
BUT REJECTION FROM A FOOL
IS CRUEL
and I don't mind if you forget me
I don't mind if your forget me

 

DIAL-A-CLICHE

Further into the fog I fall
well, I was just
following you!
when you said:
"Do as I do and scrap your fey ways"
(dial-a-cliche)
"grow up, be a man, and close your mealy-mouth!"
(dial-a-cliche)
But the person underneath
where does he go?
does he slide by the wayside?
or...does he just die?
when you find that you've organized
your feelings, for people
who didn't like you then
and certainly don't like you now
yet still you say:
"Do as I do and scrap your fey ways"
(dial-a-cliche)
"grow up, be a man, and close your mealy-mouth!"
(dial-a-cliche)
"the Safe way is the only way!
there's always time to change, son!"
yes well I've changed
but I'm in pain!
dial-a-chiche

 

MARGARET ON THE GUILLOTINE

The kind people
have a wonderful dream
Margaret on the guillotine
because people like you
make me feel so tired
when will you die?
when will you die?
when will you die?
when will you die?
when will you die?
because people like you
make me feel so old inside
please die
and kind people
do not shelter this dream
make it real
make the dream real
make the dream real
make it real

 

OUR FRANK

Our frank and open
deep conversations
they get me nowhere
they bring me down, so
give it a rest, won't you?
give me a cigarette
God give me patience
just no more conversation
Give us a drink
and make it quick
or else I'm gonna be sick
sick all over
your frankly vulgar
red pullover
now see how the colours blend
Our frank and open
deep conversations
they get me nowhere
they bring me down, so
give it a rest, won't you?
now will you just give over
the world may be ending
but look, I'm only human
Give us a drink
and make it quick
or else I'm gonna be sick
all over
your frankly vulgar
red pullover
now see how the two colours blend
Won't somebody stop me
from thinking all the time
about everything
so deeply
so bleakly

 

ASIAN RUT

Day oh so late
strangely the sun still shone
oh Asian boy
what are you on?
Day oh so late
strangely the sun still shone
what drugs are you on?
Tooled-up Asian boy
has come here to avenge
the cruel, cold killing
of his very best friend
Tooled-up Asian boy
has come here to take revenge
for the cruel, cold killing
of his only friend
Peace through the school
so quiet in the hall
it's a strange sign for one
of what's to come
Tough and hard and pale
oh they may just impale you on railings
oh English boys
it must be wrong
three against one?
Brakes slammed, and
a gun jammed, and
as far as I could tell
brave Asian boy
dealt a blow and fell
I'm just passing through here
on my way to somewhere civilised
and maybe I'll even arrive
maybe I'll even arrive?

 

SING YOUR LIFE

Sing your life
any fool can think of words that rhyme
many others do
why don't you?
do you want to?
Sing your life
just walk right up to the microphone
and name
all the things that you love
all the things that you loathe
sing your life
all the things that you love
all the things that you loathe
oh sing your life
oh sing your life
Others sang your life
but now's your chance to shine
and have the pleasure of
saying what you mean
the rare pleasure of
meaning what you sing
oh, make no mistake, my friend
all of this will end
so sing it now
all the things you love
all the things you loathe
oh sing your life
all the things that you love
all the things that you loathe
oh sing your, oh sing your
Don't leave it all unsaid
somewhere in the wasteland of your head
and make no mistake, my friend
your pointless life will end
but before you go
can you look at the truth?
You have a lovely singing voice
a lovely singing voice
and all of those
who sing on key
they stole the notion
from you and me

 

MUTE WITNESS

Your poor witness
crying so loudly on the floor
oh but she's only trying to tell you
what it was that she saw
she is only trying to tell you
what it was that she saw
Now see her standing on the table
with her small arms flailing
and you feel such compassion
in your soul for
Your poor mute witness
still testing the strength
of our patience
oh but she's only trying to tell you
what it was that she saw
Now see her pointing to the frisbee
with a memory too fuzzy
as her silent words
describe the fright of last night
4 a.m. Norhtside, Clapham Common
who knows what she was doing there?
will she sketch the answer later?
Well, I'll ask her
"now dry your tears, my dear"
Now see her mime in time so nicely
it would all have been so clear
is only she had never volunteered
"your taxi is here, my dear"

 

KING LEER

Your boyfriend, he
went down on one knee
well, could it be
he's only got one knee?
I tried to surprise you
with Vodka
or, Tizer
I can't quite remember
but you didn't thank me
you didn't even thank me
because you never do
Your boyfriend, he
has the gift of the gab
or, could it be
the gift of the grab?
I tried to surprise you
I lay down beside you
and...nothing much happened
and you didn't phone me
you didn't even phone me
because it's not your style
to dial
Your boyfriend, he
displays to me
more than just
a hint of cruelty
I tried to surprise you
I crept up behind you
with a homeless chihuahua
you gushed for an hour
you handed him back and said
"You'll never guess
I'm bored now"

 

FOUND FOUND FOUND

found found found found found found
someone who's worth it
in this murkiness
someone who's never
seeming scheming
found found found found found found
someone who's worth it
in this murkiness
someone who's never
seeming scheming
Oh, but if I'd never found
oh, but if I'd never found
oh, but if I'd never found
I do believe that
the more you give your love
and I do believe that
the more you offer trust
the more you chase
the more you cry
the more you're bound to lose
the more you're bound to lose
Oh, but if I'd never found
oh, but if I'd never found
somebody
who wants to be
who wants to be
with me
all the time

 

DRIVING YOUR GIRLFRIEND HOME

I'm driving
your girlfriend home
and she's saying
how she never chose you
"turn left", she says
so I turn left
and she says
"So how did I end up
so deeply involved in
the very existence
I planned on avoiding?"
and I can't answer
I'm driving
your girlfriend home
and she's laughing
to stop herself crying
"drive on", she says
so I drive on
and she says
"So how did I end up
attached to this person
when his sense of humour
gets gradually worser?"
and I can't tell her
I'm parking
outside her home
and we're shaking hands
goodnight, so politely

 

THE HARSH TRUTH OF THE CAMERA EYE

Churchillian legs
hair barely there
the harsh truth of the camera eye
Your eyes signal pain
because of the strain
of smiling
the harsh truth of the camera eye
telling you all
that you never wnated to know
showing what
you didn't want shown
My so friendly lens
zooms into
"the inner you"
and it tells the harsh truth
and nothing but
Laugh with us all here
that's if you can
then take the pictures home
and screamtelling you all
that you never wanted to know
showing you what
you didn't want shown
This photographer
he must have really had it in for you
"Oh, I don't want
to be judged anymore
I don't wnat to be judged
I would sooner be Loved
I would sooner be
just blindly Loved..."

 

(I'M) THE END OF THE FAMILY LINE

With no complications
fifteen generations
(of mine)
all honouring Nature
until I arrive
(with incredible style)
I'm the end fo the line
the end of the family line
the end of the line
No baby pulled screaming
out into this seething whirl
by chance or whim
(or even love?)
our family tree hacked into decline
and I'm spared the pain
of ever saying
("goodbye")
I'm the end of the line
the end of the family line
the end of the line

 

THERE'S A PLACE IN HELL FOR ME AND MY FRIENDS

There is a place
reserved
for me and my friends
and when we go
we all will go
so you see
I'm never alone
there is a place
with a bit more time
and a few more
gentler words
and looking back
we do forgive
(we had no choice
we always did)
all that we hope
is that when we go
our skin
and our blood
and our bones
don't get in your way
making you ill
the way they did
when we lived
There is a place
a place in hell
reserved
for me and my friends
and if ever I
wanted to cry
then I will
because I can

 

TONY THE PONY

Still drinking on the corner 
Just don't say I didn't warn you 
Always nagging big brother 
He's only looking out for you 
Tony The Pony 
Tony The Pony 
You're still standing on the corner 
Just don't say I didn't warn you 
Old and jealous big brother 
You had your time and you spent it 
Crying 
Now, Tony The Pony 
Tony The Pony 
So, that's what they call you now ? 
When you're free outside 
So cold and hard and in control 
And ... 
There's a free ride on 
Tony The Pony 
Oh, why do you always wanna stop me 
From doing the things in life that make me happy ? 
And when I'm outside with friends, laughing loudly 
Why do you always wanna stop me ? 
Oh, I would never 
I would never 
But you will carry the can for anyone 
The free ride on 
Gullible Tony 
You're drunker quicker 
And you're sicker even quicker 
For something heavy is gonna fall on you 
Oh ... 
And what do they call you now ? 
When you're free outside 
So cold and hard and in control 
And, oh ... been a lark 
There's a free ride on 
Fucked-up Tony 
I will never say I told you so 
Or how I knew that something bad 
Would happen to you 
I don't wanna say I told you so 
Oh, but Tony, I told you so !!! 
I told you so

 

YOU'RE GONNA NEED SOMEONE ON YOUR SIDE

With the world's fate 
Resting on your shoulder 
You're gonna need 
Someone on your side 
You can't do it by yourself 
Any longer 
You're gonna need 
Someone on your side 
Someone kindly told me 
That you'd wasted 
Eight of nine lives
Oh, give yourself a break 
Before you break down 
You're gonna need someone on your side 
And here I am, And here I am 
Well, you don't need 
To look so pleased ! 
Day or night, 
There is no difference 
You're gonna need someone on your side 
Day or night, 
There is no difference 
You're gonna need someone soon 
And here I am, And here I am 
Well, you don't need 
To look so pleased

 

GLAMOROUS GLUE

First day with the jar 
You find 
Everyone lies 
First day with the jar 
You find 
Everyone lies, nobody minds 
Everyone lies 
Where is the man you respect ? 
And where is the woman you love ? 
Where's the woman you love ? 
Third week with the jar
You find 
Everything dies 
We won't vote Conservative 
Because we never have 
Everyone lies, everyone lies 
Where is the man you respect ? 
And where is the woman you love ? 
Where's the woman you love ? 
Everything of worth 
On Earth Is there To share 
I used to dream, and I used to vow 
I wouldn't dream of it now 
We look to Los Angeles 
For the language we use 
London is dead, London is dead, London is dead...
Now I'm too much in love 
I'm too much in love 
I know 
I'll go 
Empty hand 
From the land

 

WE'LL LET YOU KNOW

How sad are we ? 
And how sad have we been ? 
We'll let you know 
We'll let you know 
Oh, but only if - you're really interested 
You wonder how 
We've stayed alive 'till now 
We'll let you know 
We'll let you know 
But only if - you're really interested 
We're all smiles 
Then, honest, I swear, it's the turnstiles 
That make us hostile 
Oh ... 
We will descend 
On anyone unable to defend 
Themselves 
Oh ... 
And the songs we sing 
They're not supposed to mean a thing 
La, la, la, la ... 
Oh ...You're lonely, Oh ... you're lonely, Oh ... 
GET OFF THE ROOF ! Oh ... 
Your Arsenal !
We may seem cold, or 
We may even be 
The most depressing people you've ever known 
At heart, what's left, we sadly know 
That we are the last truly British people you'll ever know 
We are the last truly British people you will ever know 
You'll never never want to know

 

THE NATIONAL FRONT DISCO

David, the wind blows 
The wind blows ... 
Bits of your life away 
Your friends all say ... 
"Where is our boy ? Oh, we've lost our boy" 
But they should know 
Where you've gone 
Because again and again you've explained that 
You're going to ... 
Oh, you're going to ... 
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah 
England for the English ! 
England for the English ! 
David, the winds blow 
The winds blow ...
All of my dreams away 
And I still say : 
"Where is our boy ? Ah, we've lost our boy" 
But I should know 
Why you've gone 
Because again and again you've explained
You've gone to the ... 
National, ah ... 
To the National .. 
There's a country; you don't live there 
But one day you would like to 
And if you show them what you're made of 
Oh, then you might do ... 
But David, we wonder 
We wonder if the thunder 
Is ever really gonna begin 
Begin, begin 
Your mom says : 
"I've lost my boy" 
But she should know 
Why you've gone 
Because again and again you've explained 
You've gone to the : 
National 
To the National 
To the National Front Disco 
Because you want the day to come sooner 
You want the day to come sooner 
You want the day to come sooner 
When you've settled the score 
Oh, the National 
Oh, the National

 

CERTAIN PEOPLE I KNOW

I take the cue from 
Certain people I know 
I use the cue 
And then I 
Hand it on to you 
And when I swing it 
So, it catches his eye ... 
(Weren't you there ? 
- You'd have died !) 
I trust the views of 
Certain people I know 
They look at Danger 
And they 
LAUGH THEIR HEADS OFF 
Their clothes are Imitation 
George the 23rd 
(Don't you find this absurd ?) 
I'd hate to be like 
Certain people I know 
They break their necks 
And can't afford to
Get them fixed 
Ah, they'd sacrifice all 
Of their principles for 
anything cashable 
I do believe it's terrible 
Oh, wo, wo, Ah, ah, ah, ah, Oh, wo, wo...

 

WE HATE IT WHEN OUR FRIENDS BECOME SUCCESSFUL

We hate it when our friends become successful 
We hate it when our friends become successful 
Oh, look at those clothes 
Now look at that face, it's so old 
And such a video ! 
Well, it's really laughable 
Ha, ha, ha ...
We hate it when our friends become successful 
And if they're Northern, that makes it even worse
And if we can destroy them 
You bet your life we will 
Destroy them 
If we can hurt them 
Well, we may as well ... 
It's really laughable 
Ha, ha, ha ... 
You see, it should've been me 
It could've been me 
Everybody knows 
Everybody says so 
They say : 
"Ah, you have loads of songs 
So many songs 
More songs than they'd stand 
Verse 
Chorus 
Middle eight 
Break, fade 
Just listen ..."
La, la-la, la-la

SEASICK, YET STILL DOCKED

I am a poor freezingly cold soul 
So far from where 
I intended to go 
Scavenging through life's very constant lulls 
So far from where I'm determined to go 
Wish I knew the way to reach the one I love
There is no way ... 
Wish I had the charm to attract the one I love 
But you see, I've got no charm 
Mmm...
Tonight I've consumed much more than I can hold 
Oh, this is very clear to you 
And you can tell I have never really loved 
You can tell, by the way, I sleep all day
And all of my life no-one gave me anything 
No-one has ever given me anything 
My love is as sharp as a needle in your eye 
You must be such a fool 
To pass me by

 

I KNOW IT'S GONNA HAPPEN SOMEDAY

My love, wherever you are 
Whatever you are 
Don't lose faith 
I know it's gonna happen someday 
To you 
Please wait ... Please wait ... Oh ... Wait ... 
Don't lose faith 
You say that the day just never arrives 
And it's never seemed so far away 
Still, I know it's gonna happen someday 
To you 
Please wait ... 
Don't lose faith

Tomorrow 
Does it have to come ?
All I ask of you is one thing that you'll never do 
Would you put your arms around me ? 
(I won't tell anybody) 
Tomorrow 
And what must come before ...
Oh, the pain in my arms 
Oh, the pain in my legs 
Ooh, my shiftless body 
Tomorrow 
It's surely nearer now ? 
You don't think I'll make it 
I never said I wanted to ! 
Well did I ? 
Oh, the pain in my arms 
Oh, the pain in my legs 
Oh, yeah; oh, yeah, No, yeah; no, yeah 
Through my shiftless body 
Tomorrow, Tomorrow 
All I ask of you ... oh ... 
Is : would you tell me that you love me 
Tell me, tell me that you love me, Tell me, tell me that you love me ... 
Ah, I know you don't mean it 
Ah, I know you don't mean it 
Tell me, tell me that you love me, Tell me, tell me that you love me ...

NOVEMBER SPAWNED A MONSTER

Sleep on and dream of Love
because it's the closest you will get to love
poor twisted child, so ugly, so ugly
poor twisted child, oh hug me, oh hug me
one November spawned a monster 
in the shape of this child who later cried
"But Jesus made me, so Jesus save me from
pity, sympathy and people discussing me"
a frame of useless limbs what can make GOOD
all the BAD that's been done?
And if the lights were out
could you even bear
to kiss her full on the mouth (or anywhere?)
poor twisted child, so ugly, so ugly
poor twisted child, oh hug me, oh hug me
one November spawned a monster 
in the shape of this child who must remain
a hostage to kindess and the wheels underneath her
a hostage to kindess and the wheels underneath her
a symbol of where mad, mad lovers
must PAUSE and draw the line
So sleep and dream of love
because it's the closest
you will get to love
that November is a time which I must put OUT of my mind
oh one fine day 
LET IT BE SOON
she won't be rich or beautiful
but she'll be walking your streets
in the clothes that she went out
and chose for herself

THE LOOP

I just wanna say 
I haven't been away 
I'm still right here

So one day, if you're bored 
By all means call 
Because you can do

I just wanna say

SISTER I'M A POET

All over this town 
Yes, a low wind may blow 
And I can see through everybo... 
With no reason 
To hide these words I feel 
And no reason 
To talk about the books I read 
But still I do 
That's 'cause I'm a ... Sister I'm a ... 
All over this town 
Along this way 
Outside the prison gates 
I love the romance of crime 
And I wonder 
Does anybody feel the way I do ? 
And is evil just something you are 
Or something you do ? 
Sister I'm a ... Sister I'm a ... 
All over this town, All over this town 
They pull over 
In their Citroen vans 
Not to shake your hand 
With meths on their breaths 
And you with youth on your side 
A plastic bag stranded at the lights 
This once was me ...
But now I'm a ... Sister I'm a ...
All over this town ... Oh, oh, oh 
All over this town, All over this town, Oh ... 
I still cannot speak French ... I am very lazy

 

JACK THE RIPPER

Oh, you look so tired 
Mouth slack and wide 
Ill-housed and ill-advised 
Your face is as mean 
As your life has been 
Crash into my arms 
I WANT YOU 
You don't agree -
But you don't refuse 
I know you 
And I know a place 
Where no one is likely to pass 
Oh, you don't care if it's late 
And you don't care if you're lost 
And oh, you look so tired 
(But tonight you presumed too much) 
Too much, too much 
And if it's the last 
Thing I ever do 
I'M GONNA GET YOU 
Crash into my arms 
I WANT YOU 
You don't agree -
But you don't refuse 
I know you 
And no one knows a thing about my life 
I can come and go as I please 
And if I want to, I can stay 
Oh, or if I want to, I can leave 
Nobody knows me, Nobody knows me, Nobody knows me Oh, oh...

 

SUCH A LITTLE THING MAKES SUCH A BIG DIFFERENCE

Such a little thing, such a little thing
but the difference it made was grave
there you go
wielding a bicycle chain
oh why won't you change
cange and be nicer?
such a little thing
a gentle tone of kindness
or written words on paper
- can you write?
How I love all of
the very simple things of life
(God's good air)
how I love all of
the very simple things of life
such a little thing
a fumbling politeness
the difference it saved me
wielding a bicycle chain
"I WILL NOT CHANGE AND I WILL NOT BE NICE"
Most people keep their brains between your legs (don't you find?)
Leave me alone - I was only singing, leave me alone because
I was only singing
leave me alone - I was only singing, leave me alone
you have just proved (again)
MOST PEOPLE KEEP THEIR BRAINS BETWEEN THEIR LEGS

 

I KNOW IT'S GONNA HAPPEN SOMEDAY

My love, wherever you are 
Whatever you are 
Don't lose faith 
I know it's gonna happen someday 
To you 
Please wait ... 
Please wait ... 
Oh ... Wait ... 
Don't lose faith 
You say that the day just never arrives 
And it's never seemed so far away 
Still, I know it's gonna happen someday 
To you 
Please wait ... 
Don't lose faith

 

WE'LL LET YOU KNOW

How sad are we ? 
And how sad have we been ? 
We'll let you know, We'll let you know 
Oh, but only if - you're really interested 
You wonder how 
We've stayed alive 'till now 
We'll let you know, We'll let you know 
But only if - you're really interested 
We're all smiles 
Then, honest, I swear, it's the turnstiles 
That make us hostile 
Oh ... We will descend 
On anyone unable to defend 
Themselves 
Oh ... And the songs we sing 
They're not supposed to mean a thing 
La, la, la, la ... Oh ...
You're lonely, Oh ... you're lonely 
Oh ... 
GET OFF THE ROOF !
Oh ... Your Arsenal !
We may seem cold, or 
We may even be 
The most depressing people you've ever known 
At heart, what's left, we sadly know 
That we are the last truly British people you'll ever know 
We are the last truly British people you will ever know 
You'll never never want to know

 

SUEDHEAD

Why do you come here
why do you hang around
I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry
Why do you come here
when you know it makes
things hard for me
when you know, oh
why do you come?
Why do you telephone?
and why send me silly notes?
I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry
why do you come here
when you know it makes
thing hard for me
when you know, oh
why do you come?
You had to sneak into my room
'just' to read my diary
was it just to see all the things
you knew I'd written about you?
and...so many illustrations
I'm so very sickened
oh, I am so sickened NOW

 

HE KNOWS I'D LOVE TO SEE HIM

He Knows (he knows)
Or, I think he does
because when I lived
in the Arse of the world...
he knows, he knows, he knows I'd love
to see him happy (or as close as is allowed)
because when I lived
in the Arse of the world
he knows, he knows, he knows I'd love
to see him happy (or as close as possible
as close as possible, as close as is allowed)
My name still conjours up deadly deeds
and a bad taste in the mouth
the police - they actually knew me
they said:
"You're just another person in the world
you're just another fool with radical views
you're just another who has maddening views
you want to turn it on its head
by staying in bed!"
I said: "I know I do"

 

YOU'RE GONNA NEED SOMEONE ON YOUR SIDE

With the world's fate 
Resting on your shoulder 
You're gonna need 
Someone on your side 
You can't do it by yourself 
Any longer 
You're gonna need 
Someone on your side 
Someone kindly told me 
That you'd wasted 
Eight of nine lives
Oh, give yourself a break 
Before you break down 
You're gonna need someone on your side 
And here I am, And here I am 
Well, you don't need 
To look so pleased ! 
Day or night, 
There is no difference 
You're gonna need someone on your side 
Day or night, 
There is no difference 
You're gonna need someone soon 
And here I am, And here I am 
Well, you don't need 
To look so pleased

 

GLAMOROUS GLUE

First day with the jar 
You find 
Everyone lies 
First day with the jar 
You find 
Everyone lies, nobody minds, Everyone lies 
Where is the man you respect ? 
And where is the woman you love ? 
Where's the woman you love ? 
Third week with the jar
You find 
Everything dies 
We won't vote Conservative 
Because we never have 
Everyone lies, everyone lies 
Where is the man you respect ? 
And where is the woman you love ? 
Where's the woman you love ? 
Everything of worth 
On Earth, Is there, To share 
I used to dream, and I used to vow 
I wouldn't dream of it now 
We look to Los Angeles 
For the language we use 
London is dead, London is dead, London is dead, ...
Now I'm too much in love 
I'm too much in love, 
I know I'll go 
Empty hand 
From the land

 

WE HATE IT WHEN OUR FRIENDS BECOME SUCCESSFUL

We hate it when our friends become successful 
We hate it when our friends become successful 
Oh, look at those clothes 
Now look at that face, it's so old 
And such a video ! 
Well, it's really laughable 
Ha, ha, ha ...
We hate it when our friends become successful 
And if they're Northern, that makes it even worse
And if we can destroy them 
You bet your life we will 
Destroy them 
If we can hurt them 
Well, we may as well ... 
It's really laughable 
Ha, ha, ha ... 
You see, it should've been me 
It could've been me 
Everybody knows 
Everybody says so 
They say : 
"Ah, you have loads of songs 
So many songs 
More songs than they'd stand 
Verse 
Chorus 
Middle eight 
Break, fade 
Just listen ..."
La, la-la, la-la

 

NOW MY HEART IS FULL

There's gonna be some trouble 
A whole house will need re-building 
And everyone I love in the house 
Will recline on an analyst's couch quite 
Soon 
Your Father cracks a joke 
And in the usual way 
Empties the room 
Tell all of my friends 
(I don't have too many 
Just some rain-coated lovers' puny brothers)
Dallow, Spicer, Pinkie, Cubitt 
Rush to danger 
Wind up nowhere 
Patric Doonan - raised to wait 
I'm tired again, I've tried again, and 
Now my heart is full 
Now my heart is full 
And I just can't explain 
So I won't even try to
Dallow, Spicer, Pinkie, Cubitt 
Every jammy Stressford poet 
Loafing oafs in all-night chemists 
Loafing oafs in all-night chemists 
Underact - express depression 
Ah, but Bunnie I loved you 
I was tired again 
I've tried again, and 
Now my heart is full 
Now my heart is full 
And I just can't explain 
So I won't even try to 
Could you pass by ? 
Could you pass by ? 
Oh ... 
Now my heart is full 
Now my heart is full 
And I just can't explain 
So ... slow ... 
Slow ... slow ... slow ... slow ... slow ...

 

SPRING-HEELED JIM

Spring-heeled Jim winks an eye 
He'll "do", he'll never be "done to" 
He takes on whoever flew through 
"Well, it's the normal thing to do" ... ah ... 
Spring-heeled Jim lives to love 
Now kissing with his mouth full 
And his eyes on some other fool 
So many women 
His head should be spinning 
Ah, but no ! 
Ah, but no ! 
But no !
Ah, no !
Spring-heeled Jim slurs the words : 
"There's no need to be so knowing
Take life at five times the 
Average speed, like I do" 
Until Jim feels the chill 
"Oh, where did all the time go ?" 
Once always in for the kill 
Now it's too cold 
And he feels too 
old 
Too old
Mmm, old... 
La, la, la, la-la, la ...

 

BILLY BUDD

Say, Billy Budd 
So you think you should ? 
Oh, everyone's laughing 
Say, Billy Budd 
So you think that you should ? 
Everyone's laughing ! 
Since I took up with you 
Things have been bad 
Yeah, but now it's 12 years on 
Now it's 12 years on 
Yes, and I took up with you 
I took my job application 
Into town 
Did you hear ? They turned me down 
Yes, and it's all because of us 
Oh, and what was in our eyes 
Oh, what was in our eyes, yeah 
I said, Billy Budd 
I would happily lose 
Both of my legs 
I would lose both of my legs 
Oh, if it meant you could be free 
Oh, if it meant you could be free 
(Don't leave us in the dark!)

 

HOLD ON TO YOUR FRIENDS

A bond of trust 
Has been abused 
Something of value 
May be lost 
Give up your job 
Squander your cash - be rash 
Just hold on to your friends 
There are more than enough 
To fight and oppose 
Why waste good time 
Fighting the people you like 
Who will fall defending your name 
Oh, don't feel so ashamed 
To have friends 
But now you only call me 
When you're feeling depressed 
When you feel happy I'm 
So far from your mind 
My patience is stretched 
My loyalty vexed 
Oh, you're losing all of your friends 
Hold on to your friends 
Hold on to your friends 
Resist - or move on 
Be mad, be rash 
Smoke and explode 
Sell all of your clothes 
Just bear in mind : 
Oh, there just might come a time 
When you need some friends

 

THE MORE YOU IGNORE ME, THE CLOSER I GET

The more you ignore me 
The closer I get 
You're wasting your time 
The more you ignore me 
The closer I get 
You're wasting your time 
I will be 
In the bar 
With my head 
On the bar 
I am now 
A central part 
Of your mind's landscape 
Whether you care 
Or do not 
Yeah, I've made up your mind 
The more you ignore me 
The closer I get 
You're wasting your time 
The more you ignore me 
The closer I get 
You're wasting your time 
Beware !
I bear more grudges 
Than lonely high court judges 
When you sleep 
I will creep 
Into your thoughts 
Like a bad debt 
That you can't pay 
Take the easy way 
And give in 
Yeah, and let me in 
Oh, let me in 
Oh let me ... 
Oh, let me in 
IT'S WAR 
IT'S WAR 
WAR 
WAR 
Oh, let me in 
Ah, the closer I get 
Ah, you're asking for it 
Ah, the closer I get 
Ooh, the closer I ...

 

WHY DON'T YOU FIND OUT FOR YOURSELF

The sanest days are mad 
Why don't you find out for yourself ? 
Then you'll see the price 
Very closely 
Some men here 
They have a special interest 
In your career 
They wanna help you to grow 
And then syphon all your dough 
Why don't you find out for yourself ? 
Then you'll see the glass 
Hidden in the grass 
You'll never believe me, so 
Why don't you find out for yourself ? 
Sick down to my heart 
That's just the way it goes 
Some men here 
They know the full extent of 
Your distress 
They kneel and pray 
And they say : 
"Long may it last" 
Why don't you find out for yourself ?
Then you'll see the glass 
Hidden in the grass 
Bad scenes come and go 
For which you must allow 
Sick down to my heart 
That's just the way it goes 
Don't rake up my mistakes 
I know exactly what they are 
And ... what do YOU do ? 
Well ... you just SIT THERE 
I've been stabbed in the back 
So many many times 
I don't have any skin 
But that's just the way it goes

 

I AM HATED FOR LOVING

I am hated for loving 
I am hated for loving 
Anonymous call, a poison pen 
A brick in the small of the back again 
I still don't belong 
To anyone - I am mine 
And I am hated for loving 
I am haunted for wanting 
Anonymous call, a poison pen 
A brick in the ... ah ... 
A brick in the small of the back again 
I still don't belong 
To anyone - I am mine 
I am falling 
With no-one to catch me 
I am falling 
And there's still 
No-one to catch me 
Ah .. 
Anonymous call, a poison pen 
A brick in the ... ah ... 
A brick in the small of the back again 
I just don't belong 
To anywhere 
I just don't belong 
Mmm ... 
Ah ...

 

LIFEGUARD SLEEPING, GIRL DROWNING

Always looking for attention 
Always needs to be mentioned 
Who does she 
Think she should be ? 
The shrill cry through darkening air 
Doesn't she know he's 
Had such a busy day ? 
Tell her ... sshhh
Somebody tell her ... sshhh 
Slowest ... 
It was only a test 
But she swam too far 
Against the tide 
She deserves all she gets 
The sky became marked with stars 
As an out-stretched arm slowly 
Disappears 
Hooray 
Oh hooray 
No, oh, oh, woh, there's no movement 
No, oh, hooray 
Oh, hooray 
Please don't worry 
There'll be no fuss 
She was ... nobody's nothing 
(What's your name ?) 
When he awoke 
The sea was calm 
And another day passes like a dream 
There's no ... no way 
(What's your name ?)

 

USED TO BE A SWEET BOY

Used to be a sweet boy 
Holding so tightly 
To Daddy's hand 
But that was all 
In some distant land 
Blazer and tie 
And a big bright healthy smile 
Used to make all 
Of our trials worthwhile 
Used to be a sweet boy 
And I'm not to blame 
Something went wrong 
And I know 
I'm not to blame 
Something went wrong 
Can't be to blame 
Ah ...

 

THE LAZY SUNBATHERS

A world war 
Was announced 
Days ago 
But they didn't know 
The lazy sunbathers 
The lazy sunbathers 
The sun burns through 
To the planet's core 
And it isn't enough 
They want more 
Nothing 
Appears 
To be 
Between the ears of 
The lazy sunbathers 
Too jaded 
To question stagnation 
The sun burns through 
To the planet's core 
And it isn't enough 
They want more 
Religions fall 
Children shelled 
"...Children shelled ? That's all 
Very well, but would you 
Please keep the noise 
Down low ? 
Because you're waking 
The lazy sunbathers ..."
Oh, the lazy sunbathers 
The lazy sunbathers

 

SPEEDWAY

And when you slam 
Down the hammer 
Can you see it in your heart ? 
All of the rumours 
Keeping me grounded 
I never said, I never said that they were 
Completely unfounded 
So when you slam 
Down the hammer 
Can you see it in your heart ? 
Can you delve so low ? 
And when you're standing 
On my fingers 
Can you see it in your heart ? ... ah ... 
And when you try 
To break my spirit 
It won't work 
Because there's nothing left to break 
Anymore 
All of the rumours 
Keeping me grounded 
I never said, I never said that they were 
Completely unfounded 
You won't sleep 
Until the earth that wants me 
Finally has me 
Oh you've done it now 
You won't rest 
Until the hearse that becomes me 
Finally takes me 
Oh you've done it now 
And you won't smile 
Until my loving mouth 
Is shut good and proper 
FOREVER 
All of the rumours 
Keeping me grounded 
I never said, I never said that they were 
Completely unfounded 
And all those lies 
Written lies, twisted lies 
Well, they weren't lies 
They weren't lies 
They weren't lies 
I never said 
I never said 
I could have mentioned your name 
I could have dragged you in 
Guilt by implication 
By association 
I've always been true to you 
In my own strange way 
I've always been true to you 
In my own sick way 
I'll always stay true to you

 

THE TEACHERS ARE AFRAID OF THE PUPILS

There's too many people 
Planning your downfall 
When your spirit's on trial 
These nights can be frightening 
Sleep transports sadness 
To some other mid-brain 
And somebody here 
Will not be here next year 
So you stand by the board 
Full of fear and intention 
And, if you think that they're listening 
Well, you've got to be joking 
Oh, you understand change 
And you think it's essential 
But when your profession 
Is humiliation 
Say the wrong word to our children ...
We'll have you, oh yes, we'll have you 
Lay a hand on our children 
And it's never too late to have you 
Mucus on your collar 
A nail up through the staff chair 
A blade in your soap 
And you cry into your pillow 
To be finished would be a relief 
To be finished would be a relief... 
Say the wrong word to our children ...
We'll have you, oh yes, we'll have you 
Lay a hand on our children 
And it's never too late to have you 
To be finished would be a relief 
To be finished would be a relief...
I'm very glad this thing has come 
Sometimes I'm so glad 
Never bother to play the tunes 
I've seen it coming for dear life

 

READER MEET AUTHOR

You don't know a thing about their lives 
They live where you wouldn't dare to drive
You shake as you think of how they sleep 
But you write as if you are my side-by-side 
Reader, meet Author 
With the hope of hearing sense 
But you may be feeling let down 
By the words of defence 
He says : "No-one ever sees me when I cry"
You don't know a thing about their lives 
Books don't save them, books aren't Stanley knives 
And if a fight broke out here tonight 
You'd be the first away, because you're that type 
And the Year 2000 won't change anyone here 
As each fabled promise flies so fast 
You'll swear it was never there 
Oh, have you ever escaped from a shipwrecked life ? 
So safely with your software; all miles from the front line 
You hear the way their sad voices, and you start to imagine things 
Oh, any excuse to write more lies

 

THE BOY RACER

He's just too good-natured and

THE OPERATION

You fight with your right hand 
And caress with your left hand 
Everyone I know is sick to death of you 
With a tear that's a mile wide 
In the kite that you're flying 
Everyone I know is sick to death of you 
Ever since 
You don't look the same 
You're just not the same, no way 
You say clever things and 
You never used to 
You don't catch what I'm saying 
When you're deafened to advice 
Everyone here is sick to the 
Back teeth of you 
With a tear that's a mile wide 
In the kite that you're flying 
Everyone here is sick to the 
Tattoo of you 
Ever since 
You don't look the same 
You're just not the same, no way 
You say pleasant things and 
There is no need to
Still, you fight with your right hand 
And caress with your left hand 
Ooh, ooh ... Sad to say ... 
How once I was in love with you 
Sad to say ... 
You don't catch what I'm saying 
When you're deafened to advice 
Ooh, ooh ... Ever since 
You don't look the same 
You're just not the same, no way 
What the hell have 
They stuck into you ?

 

DAGENHAM DAVE

Head in the clouds, and a mouthful of pie 
Head in a blouse, everybody loves him 
I see why 
Dagenham Dave, Dagenham Dave, Oh, Dagenham Dave 
Dagenham Dave, Dagenham Dave, Oh, Dagenham Dave 
"I love Karen, I love Sharon" on the windowscreen 
With never the need to fight or to question a single thing 
Dagenham Dave, Dagenham Dave Oh, Dagenham Dave 
Dagenham Dave, Dagenham Dave Oh, Dagenham Dave ...
He'd love to touch, he's afraid that he might self-combust 
I could say more, but you get the general idea

Dagenham, Dagenham Dagenham Dave, Dagenham Dave ...
Oh, Dave, oh, Dagenham, dagenham, Oh, Dave, oh, Dave, ...

 

DO YOUR BEST AND DON'T WORRY

Compare the best of their days 
With the worst of your days 
You won't win 
With your standards so high 
And your spirits so low 
At least remember ... 
This is you on a bad day, you on a pale day 
Just do your best and don't ... Don't worry, oh 
The way you hang yourself is oh, so unfair 
See the best of how they look 
Against the worst of how you are
And again, you won't win 
With your standards so high 
And your spirits so low 
At least remember ... 
This is you on a drab day, you in a drab dress 
Just do your best and don't ... Don't worry, oh 
The way you hang yourself is oh, so unfair 
Just do your best and don't ... Don't worry, oh 
The way you watch yourself is oh, so unfair 
Just do your best and don't ... Don't worry, oh 
Do your best and don't ...

SOUTHPAW

You were a boy before you became a man 
I don't see the joy 
And you ran with your pals in the sun 
You turned around and they were gone 
Again ... 
A sick boy should be treated 
So easily defeated 
Oh, I just don't understand 
So you ran with your pals in the sun 
You turned around 
You were alone 
Again ... 
And you ran back to Ma 
Which set the pace for the rest of your days 
Oh, you ran back to Ma 
Which set the pace for the rest of your days 
Oh, you ran back to Ma 
Which set the pace for the rest of your days 
And now, there is something that you should know 
There is something that you should know 
The girl of your dreams is

Sad and is feeling all alone 
Oh, there is something that you should know 
Help me, help me, help me ...

 

MALADJUSTED

I wanna start from 
Before the beginning 
Loot wine, "Be mine, and 
Then let's stay out for the night"
Ride via Parkside 
Semi-perilous lives 
Jeer the lights in the windows 
Of all safe and stable homes 
(But wondering then, well what 
Could peace of mind be like ?)
Anyway do you want to hear 
Our story, or not ? 
As the Fulham Road lights 
Stretch and invite into the night 
From a Stevenage overspill 
We'd kill to live around 
SW6 - with someone like you 
Keep thieves' hours 
With someone like you 
...As long as it slides 
You stalk the house 
In a low-cut blouse : 
"Oh Christ, another stifled 
Friday night !"
And the Fulham Road lights 
Stretch and invite into the night 
Well, I was fifteen 
What could I know ?
When the gulf between 
All the things I need 
And the things I receive 
Is an ancient ocean 
Wide, wild, lost, uncrossed 
Still I maintain there's nothing 
Wrong with you 
You do all that you do 
Because it's all you can do 
Well, I was fifteen 
Where could I go ?
With a soul full of loathing 
For stinging bureaucracy 
Making it anything 
Other than easy 
For working girls like me 
With my hands on my head 
I flop on your bed 
With a head full of dread 
For all I've ever said 
Maladjusted, maladjusted 
Maladjusted maladjusted 
Never to be trusted 
Oh, never to be trusted 
There's nothing wrong with you, oh 
...There's nothing wrong with you

 

ALMA MATTERS

So : the choice I have made 
May seem strange to you 
But who asked you, anyway ? 
It's my life to wreck 
My own way 
You see : to someone, somewhere, oh yeah ... 
Alma matters 
In mind, body and soul 
In part, and in whole 
Because to someone, somewhere, oh yeah ... 
Alma matters 
In mind, body and soul 
In part, and in whole 
So the life I have made 
May seem wrong to you 
But, I've never been surer 
It's my life to ruin 
My own way 
You see : to someone, somewhere, oh yeah ... 
Alma matters 
In mind, body and soul 
In part, and in whole 
Because to someone, somewhere, oh yeah ... 
Alma matters 
In mind, body and soul 
In part, and in whole 
To someone, somewhere, oh yeah ... 
Alma matters 
In mind, body and soul 
Part, and in whole 
So to someone, somewhere, oh yeah ... 
Alma matters 
In mind, body and soul 
Part, and in whole 
To someone, somewhere, oh yeah ... 
Oh yeah ... Oh yeah, oh yeah Oh yeah ...

 

AMBITIOUS OUTSIDERS

Bolt-lock your doors 
Alarm your cars 
And still we move in closer 
Every day 
Top of the list 
Is your smiling kids 
But we'll be smiling too 
So that's OK 
Oh, and by the way 
Thank you, because you're 
Giving, giving, giving 
And we're receiving - 
No, no, we're taking 
Keeping the population down 
Your taxes paid, but 
Police waylaid 
And we knows 
When the school bus 
Comes and goes 
We're on your street, but 
You don't see us 
Or, if you do 
You smile and say Hello 
BUT DON'T UNDERESTIMATE US 
When you are 
Giving, giving, giving 
And we're receiving - 
No, no, we're taking 
Just keeping 
The population down 
You're giving, giving, giving 
Well, it's your own fault 
For reproducing 
We're just keeping 
The population down

 

TROUBLE LOVES ME

Trouble loves me 
Trouble needs me 
Two things 
More than you do 
Or would attempt to 
So, console me 
Otherwise, hold me 
Just when it seems like 
Everything's evened out 
And the balance 
Seems serene 
Trouble loves me 
Walks beside me 
To chide me 
Not to guide me 
It's still much more 
Than you'll do 
So, console me 
Otherwise, hold me 
Just when it seems like 
Everything's evened out 
And the balance seems serene 
See the fool I'll be 
Still running 'round 
On the flesh rampage 
Still running 'round 
Ready with ready-wit 
Still running 'round 
On the flesh rampage 
- At your age ! 
Go to Soho, oh 
Go to waste in 
The wrong arms 
Still running 'round 
Trouble loves me 
Seeks and finds me 
To charlatanize me 
Which is only 
As it should be 
Oh, please fulfill me 
Otherwise, kill me 
Show me a barrel and watch me scrape it 
Faced with the music, as always I'll face it 
In the half-light 
So English, frowning 
Then at midnight I 
Can't get you out of my head 
A disenchanted taste 
Still running 'round 
A disenchanted taste 
Still running 'round

 

PAPA JACK

Papa Jack 
Wants to turn 
Back the clock 
And reach out 
To the kids 
He once had 
Who have flown 
Papa Jack 
In decline 
Feels inclined 
To reach out 
To the kids 
He once had 
Who have flown 
But there was a time 
When the kids reached up 
And Papa Jack just 
Pushed them away 
Looking deep 
In his heart 
Papa Jack 
Doesn't like 
What he sees 
Or the time 
On his hands 
The dying day 
The chilly sun 
Papa Jack 
All alone 
Sings slow 
Grieving and low 
But there was a time 
When the kids reached up 
Now you can't always 
Have it your way 
Papa Jack 
Ah ...

 

AMMUNITION

I know these roads 
Each ridge 
And narrow bridge 
Each cheveron 
Enticing me on 
Each warning sign 
I take in my stride 
I don't need more ammunition 
I've got more than I can spend 
I don't dwell on things I'm missing 
I'm just pleased 
With the things I've found 
I know these roads 
An old hand understands 
Above all, I know what's 
Expected of me now 
Veering cliffwards 
I don't need more ammunition 
I've got more than I can spend 
I don't dwell on things I'm missing 
I'm just pleased 
With the things I've found 
With the things I've found 
With the things I've found 
I've found 
I've been crying 
It comes back on these salient days 
And it stays 
And it says : 
"We've never really been away" 
I don't need more ammunition 
I've got more than I can spend 
I don't think of who I'm missing 
I've got no space and no time 
In my life, anymore 
No space or time 
In my life, anymore 
For Revenge

 

WIDE TO RECEIVE

Download something 
Useful, or useless 
Because I'm lying here 
Wide to receive 
Almost anything 
You'd care to give 
And I don't 
Get along with myself 
And I'm not too keen 
On anyone else 
Turn on, plug in 
Then just walk away 
Unlock, process 
And then just go 
And I've never felt quite so alone 
As I do right now 
I'm lying here 
Wide to receive 
Almost anything 
You'd care to leave 
Wide, wide, wide Wide, wide, wide...

 

ROY'S KEEN

(GO ON !)
He's romancing you 
And chancing his arm 
He'll be here 
Smiling on time 
He's romancing you 
And chancing his arm 
He'll be here 
Smiling on time 
Roy's keen oh Roy's keen 
Roy's keen oh Roy's keen 
We've never seen a 
Keener window-cleaner 
Back up the ladder 
Into each corner 
Dunking the chamois 
Just think of the goodwill 
The ladder's a planet 
Roy is a star, and 
I am a satellite 
(But that's alright) 
He can hold a smile for as long 
As you require (even longer) 
He can hold a smile for as long 
As you require (even longer) 
Roy's keen oh Roy's keen 
Roy's keen oh Roy's keen 
We've never seen a 
Keener window-cleaner 
Back up the ladder 
Into each corner 
Dunking the chamois 
Just think of the goodwill 
The ladder's a planet 
Roy is a star, and 
I am a satellite 
I will be set alight 
Don't say you'll hold it steady 
Then you let it go 
Don't say you'll hold it steady 
Then you let it go Oh ...
You're up the ladder 
Into each corner 
Foot in a bucket 
We trust you to wreck it 
Even when it's under your nose 
Well, you just can't 
See it, can you ? 
Well, it's here 
Right under your nose 
And you just can't 
See it, can you? La la la la ...
Roy's keen, Roy's keen La la la la ...
We've never seen a 
Keener window-cleaner 
Oh ... La la la la ...

 

HE CRIED

I need you 
Simple words 
But words which had never been heard 
By the soul 
Stoned to death 
But still living 
And so he froze where he stood 
And he looked to the ground 
And he cried 
He cried 
Ride our minds 
If you must 
But there's always a line you don't cross 
Time is short 
Don't be cruel 
Oh you don't know the power 
In what you're saying 
Oh ... 
And so he froze where he stood 
And he looked to the ground 
And he cried 
He cried 
People where 
I come from 
They survive without feelings or blood 
I never could 
Was stoned to death 
But I'm still living 
So he froze where he stood 
And he looked to the ground 
And he cried 
He cried 
So he froze 
And he looked, and he looked 
To the ground 
And he cried 
He cried

 

SORROW WILL COME IN THE END

Legalized theft 
Leaves me bereft 
I get it straight in the neck 
(Somehow expecting no less) 
A court of justice 
With no use for Truth 
Lawyer ...liar 
Lawyer ...liar 
You pleaded and squealed 
And you think you've won 
But Sorrow will come 
To you in the end 
And as sure as my words are pure 
I praise the day that brings you pain 
Q.C.'s obsessed with sleaze 
Frantic for Fame 
They're all on the game 
They just use a different name 
You lied 
And you were believed 
By a J.P. senile and vile 
You pleaded and squealed 
And you think you've won 
But Sorrow will come 
To you in the end 
And as sure as my words are pure 
I praise the day that brings you pain 
So don't close your eyes 
Don't close your eyes 
A man who slits throats 
Has time on his hands 
And I'm gonna get you 
So don't close your eyes 
Don't ever close your eyes 
You think you've won 
OH NO

 

SATAN REJECTED MY SOUL

Satan rejected my soul 
He knows my kind 
He won't be dragged down 
He's seen my face around 
He knows Heaven doesn't seem 
To be my home 
So I must find 
Somewhere else to go 
So I must find 
Somewhere else to go 
So, take it - please 
It's free 
You'll never see 
You'll never see 
All the fun in life it's cost me 
Satan rejected my soul 
As low as he goes 
He never quite goes this low 
He's seen my face around 
He knows Heaven doesn't seem 
To be my home 
So I must find 
Somewhere else to go 
So I must find 
Somewhere else to go 
So, take it please 
It's really sly 
Come on, come on, ah Come on, come on, come on 
Take it please, It's really sly 
Come on, come on, ah Come on, come on, come on 
Call me in, Pull me in, call me in 
Come on, come on, oh Come on, come on, come on 
Pull me in, pull me in, Call me in, haul me in, pull me in 
Come on, come on, ah, Come on, come on 
La la la la la, Oh ...

 
 REEL AROUND THE FOUNTAIN

It's time the tale was told
of how you took a child
and you made him old
Reel around the fountain
slap me on the patio
I'll take it now
Fifteen minutes with you
well, I wouldn't say no
people said that you were virtually dead
and they were so wrong
fifteen minutes with you
well, i wouldn't say no
people said that you were easily led
and they were half-right
I dreamt about you last night
and i fell out of bed twice
you can pin and mount me like a butterfly
but take me to the haven of your bed
was something that you never said
two lumps, please
you're the bee's knees
but so am I
Meet me at the fountain
shove me on the patio
I'll take it slowly
Fifteen minutes with you
oh I wouldn't say no
people see no worth in you
oh but I do

 

YOU'VE GOT EVERYTHING NOW

As merry as the days were long
I was right and you were wrong
back at the old grey school
I would win and you would lose
But you've got everything now
and what a terrible mess I've made of my life
No, I've never had a job
because I've never wanted one
I've seen you smile
but I've never really heard you laugh
So who is rich and who is poor?
I cannot say...
You are your mother's only son
and you're a desperate one
But I don't want a lover
I just want to be seen in the back of your car
A friendship sadly lost?
Well, this is true ...and yet, it's false
Did I ever tell you , by the way
I never did like your face
But you've got everything now
and what a terrible mess I've made of my life
No, I've never had a job
because I'm too shy
But I don't want a lover
I just want to be tied to the back of your car.

 

MISERABLE LIE

So, goodbye
please stay with your own kind
and I'll stay with mine
There's something against us
it's not time
So, goodbye
I know I hardly say
how much I love your casual way
but please put your tongue away
a little higher and we're well away
the dark nights are drawing in
and your humour is as black as them
I look at yours, you laugh at mine
and"love" is just a miserable lie
you have destroyed my flower like-life
not once-but twice
you have corrupt my innocent mind
not once-but twice
I know that wind-swept mystical air
it means: I'd like to see your underwear
I recognise that mystical air
it means: I'd like to see your underwear
what do we get for the trouble and pain?
just a rented room in Whalley Range
into the depths of the criminal world
I followed her...
I need advice, I need advice
because nobody ever looks at me twice
I'm just a country-mile behind
the world
I'm just a country mile behind
the whole world
so take me when you go

 

PRETTY GIRLS MAKE GRAVES

Upon the sand,upon the bay
"there is a quick and easy way" you say
before you illustrate
I'd rather state:
"I'm not the man you think I am
I'm not the man you think I am "
And Sorrow's native son
he will not smile for anyone
And pretty girls makes the graves
End of the pier, end of the bay
you tug my arm and say:"Give into lust,
give up to lust, oh heaven knows we'll
soon be dust..."
But I'm not the man you think I am
I'm not the man you think I am
And Sorrow's native son
he will not rise for anyone
And pretty girls make graves
I could have been wild and I could have been free
but Nature played this trick on me
She wants it Now
and she will not wait
but she's too rough
and I'm too delicate
Then on the sand
another man, he takes her hand
and a smile lights up her stupid face
(and well, it would)
I lost my faith in Womanhood
I lost my faith in Womanhood, I lost my faith

 

THE HAND THAT ROCKS THE CRADLE

Please don't cry
the ghost and the storm outside
will not invade this sacred shire
nor infiltrate your mind
my life down I shall lie
if the bogey-man should try
to play tricks on your sacred mind
to tease, torment and tantalise
wavering shadows loom
a piano plays in an empty room
there'll be blood on the cleaver tonight
when darkness lifts and the room is bright
I'll still be by your side
for you are all that matters
and I'll love you till the day I die
there never need to be longing in your eyes
as long as the hand that rocks the cradle is mine
ceiling shadows shimmy by
and when the wardrobe towers like a beast of prey
there's a sadness in your beautiful eyes
you're untouched, unsoiled, wonderous eyes
my life down I shall lie
should restless spirts try
to play tricks on you sacred mind
but whom I never gave a name
I just looked into his wonderous eyes
and said" never never never again"
all too soon I did return
just like a moth to a flame
so rattle my bones all over the stones
because I'm only a beggar-man whom nobody owns
see how words as old as sin
fit me like a glove I'm here and here I'll stay
together we lie, together we pray
there never need be longing in your eyes
as long as the hand that rocks the cradle is mine

 

STILL ILL

I decree today that life
is simply taking and not giving
England is mine and it owes me a living
ask me why, and I'll spit in your eye
ask me why, and I'll spit in your eye
but we cannot cling to the old dreams anymore
no, we cannot cling to the old dreams anymore
Does the body rule the mind
or does the mind rule the body?
I dunno...
Under the iron bridge we kissed
and although I ended up with sore lips
it just wasn't like the old days anymore
no, it wasn't like those days
am I still ill?
Does the body rule the mind
or does the mind rule the body ?
I dunno...
Ask me why, and I'll die
ask me why, and I'll die
and if you must go to work tomorrow
well, if I were you I wouldn't bother
for there are brighter sides to life
and I should know because I've seen them
but not very often...
under the iron bridge we kissed
and although I ended up with sore lips
it just wasn't like the old days anymore
no, it wasn't like those days
am I still ill?

 

HAND IN GLOVE

Hand in glove
the sun shines out of our behinds
no, it's not like any other love
this one is different-because it's us
Hand in glove
we can go wherever we please
and everything depends upon
how near you stand to me
And if the people stare
then the people stare
I really don't know and I really don't care
Hand in glove
the Good People laugh
yes, we may be hidden by rags
but we have something they'll never have
So, hand in glove I stake my claim
I'll fight to the last breath
If they dare touch a hair on your head
I'll fight to the last breath
The Good Life is out there, somewhere
so stay on my arm, you little charmer
But I know my luck too well
and I'll probably never see you again.

 

WHAT DIFFERENCE DOES IT MAKE?

All men have secrets and here is mine
so let it be known
we have been through hell and high tide,
I can surely rely on you?
and yet you start to recoil,
heavy words are so lightly thrown
but still I'd leap in front of a flying bullet for you
So, what difference does it make?
so, what difference does it make?
it makes none
but you have gone
and you must be looking very old tonight
The devil will find work for idle hands to do
I stole and I lied, and why?
because you asked me to!
but now you make feel so ashamed
because I've only got two hands
well, I'm still fond of you
So, what difference does it make?
so, what difference does it make?
it makes none
but you have gone
and your prejudice won't keep you warm tonight
So, no more apologies
no more apologies
I'm too tired
I'm too sick and tired
and I'm feeling very sick and ill today
But I'm still fond of you

 

I DON'T OWE YOU ANYTHING

Bought on stolen wine
a nod was the first step
you know very well
what was coming next
did I really walk all this way
just to hear you say
"oh I don't want to go out tonight"
but you will
for you must
I don't owe you anything
but you owe me something
repay me now
you should never go to them
let them come to you
just like I do
you should not go to them
let them come to you
just like I do
Too freely on your lips
words prematurely said
oh but I know what will make you smile tonight
Life is never kind
life is never kind
oh but I know what will make you smile tonight

 

SUFFER LITTLE CHILDREN

Over the moors,take me to the moors
dig a shallow grave
and I'll lay me down
Lesley-Anne, with your pretty white beads
oh John, you'll never be a man
and you'll never see your home again
oh Manchester, so much to answer for
Edward, see those alluring lights?
tonight will be your very last night
a woman said "I know my son is dead
I'll never rest my hands on his scared head"
Hindley wakes and Hindley says:
"Wherever he has gone, I have gone "
But fresh lilaced moorland fields
cannot hide the stoild stench of death
Hindley wakes and Hindley says:
"Whatever he has done, I have done"
But this is no easy ride
for a child cries
"find me...find me, nothing more
we're on a sullen misty moor
we may be dead and we may be gone
but we will be right by your side
until the day you die
this is no easy ride
we will haunt you when you laugh
yes, you could say we're a team
you might sleep
BUT YOU WILL NEVER DREAM!"
Oh Manchester, so much to answer for
Oh Manchester, so much to answer for
Over the moor, I'm on the moor
the child is on the moor

 

THE HEADMASTER RITUAL

Belligerent ghouls
run Manchester schools
spineless swines
cemented mines
Sir leads the troops
jealous of youth
same old suit since 1962
he does the military two-step
down the nape of my neck
I wanna go home
I don't want to stay
give up education
is a bad mistake
mid-week on the playing fields
Sir thwacks you on the knees
knees you in the groin
elbow in the face
I wanna go home
I don't want to stay
Belligerent ghouls
run Manchester schools
spineless bastards all
Sir leads the troops
jealous of youth
same old jokes since 1902
he does the military two-step
down the nape of my neck
I wanna go home
I don't want to stay
give up life
as a bad mistake
please excuse me from gym
I've got this terrible cold coming on
he grabs and devours
he kicks me in the showers
kicks me in the showers
and he grabs and devours
I wanna go home
I don't want to stay

 

RUSHOLME RUFFIANS

The last night at the fair
by the big wheel generator
a boy is stabbed
and his money is grabbed
and the air hangs heavy like a dulling wine
she is famous
she is funny
an engagement ring
doesn't mean a thing
to a mind consumed by brass(money)
and though I walk home alone
my faith in love is still devout
the last night at the fair
from a seat on a whirling waltzer
her skirt ascends for a watching eye
it's a hideous trait( on her mother's side)
and though I walk home alone
my faith in love is still devout
then someone falls in love
and someone's beaten up
and the senses being dulled are mine
and someone falls in love
someone's beaten up
and the senses being dulled are mine
and though I walk home alone
my faith in love is still devout
this is the last night of the fair
and the grease in the hair
of a speedway operator
is all a tremulous heart requires
a schoolgirl is denied
she said "How quickly would I die
if I jumped from the top of the parachutes?"
this is the last night of the fair

I WANT THE ONE I CAN'T HAVE

On the day that your mentality
catches up with your biology
I want the one I can't have
and it's driving me mad
it's written all over my face
A double-bed
and a stalwart lover, for sure
these are the riches of the poor
A double-bed
and a stalwart lover, for sure
these are the riches of the poor
a tough kid who sometimes swallows nails
raised on Prisoner's Aid
he killed a policeman when he was thirteen
and somehow that really impressed me
it's written all over my face
On the day that your mentality
catches up with your biology
And if you ever need self-validation
just meet me in the alley by the
railway-station
it's written all over my face

 

WHAT SHE SAID

What she said:
"How come someone hasn't noticed
that I'm dead
and decided to bury me
God knows, I'm ready"
What she said was
but then, all the rejection she's had
to pretend to be happy
could only be idiocy
What she said was not for the job or
lover that she never had
What she read
all heady books
she'd sit and prophesise
(it took a tattoed boy from Birkenhead
to really really open her eyes)

THAT JOKE ISN'T FUNNY ANYMORE

Park the car at the side of the road
you should know
time's tide will smother you
and I will too
when you laugh about other people who feel so
very lonely
their only desire is to die
well I'm afraid
it doesn't make me smile
I wish I could laugh
but that joke isn't funny anymore
it's too close to home and it's too near the bone
it's too close to home and it's too near the bone
more than you'll ever know
It was dark as I drove the point home
and on cold leather seats
well, it suddenly struck me
I just might die with a smile on my
face after all
I've seen this happen in other people's lives
and now it's happening in mine

 

NOWHERE FAST

I'd like to drop my trousers to the world
I am a man of means(of slender means)
each household appliance
is like a new science in my town
and if a day came when I felt a natural emotion
I'd get such a shock I'd probably jump in the ocean
and when a train goes by
it's such a sad sound
I'd like to drop my trousers to the Queen
every sensible child will know what this means
the poor and the needy
are selfish and greedy on her terms
and if the day came when I felt a natural emotion
I'd get such a shock I'd probably jump in the ocean
and when a train goes by
it's such a sad song
And when I'm lying in my bed
I think about life
and I think about death
and neither one particularly appeals to me
and if the day came when I felt a natural emotion
I'd get such a shock I'd probably lie
in the middle of the street and die
I'd lie down and die

 

WELL I WONDER

Well I wonder
do you hear me when you sleep?
I hoarsely cry
Well I wonder
do you see me when we pass?
I half-die
Please keep me in mind
please keep me in mind
Gasping-but somehow still alive
this is the fierce last stand of all I am
Gasping-dying-but somehow still alive
this is the final stand of all I am
Please keep me in mind

 

BARBARISM BEGINS AT HOME

Unruly boys
who will not grow up
must be taken in hand
Unruly girls
who will not settle down
they must be taken in hand
A crack on the head
is what you get for not asking
and a crack on the head
is what you get for asking

 

MEAT IS MURDER

Heifer whines could be human cries
closer comes the screaming knife
this beautiful creature must die
this beautiful creature must die
a death for no reason
and death for reason is MURDER
and the flesh you so fancifully fry
is not succulent, tasty or nice
it's death for no reason
and death for no reason is MURDER
and the calf that you carve with a smile
is MURDER
and the turkey you festively slice
is MURDER
do you know how animals die?
kitchen aroma aren't very homely
it's not "comforting," "cheery" or kind
it's sizzling blood and the unholy stench
of MURDER
it's not "natural," "normal" or kind
the fleas you so fancifully fry
as you savour the flavour
of MURDER
NO, NO, NO, IT'S MURDER
NO, NO, NO, IT'S MURDER
who hears when animals cry?

 

THE QUEEN IS DEAD

Farewell to this lands cheerless marches
hemmed in like a boar between arches
her very Lowness with her head in a sling
Im truely sorry-but it sounds like a wonderful thing
dear Charles, dont you ever crave
to appear on the front of the Daily mail
dressed in your Mother's bridal veil?
So, I checked all the registered historical facts
and I was shocked into shame to discover
how Im the 18th pale descendent
of some, old queen or other
has the world changed, or have I changed?
has the world changed, or have I changed?
as some 9-year old tough peddles drugs
(I never even knew what drugs were)
And so, I broke into the Palace
with a sponge and a rusty spanner
she said: "Eh, I know you, and you cannot sing"
I said: "that's nothing -you should hear me play piano"
We can go for a walk where it's quiet and dry
and we can talk about precious things
but when you are tied to your mother's apron
not one talks about castration
We can go for a walk where it's quiet and dry
and we can talk about precious things
like love and law and poverty
these are the things that kill me
We can go for a walk where it's quiet and dry
and we can talk about precious things
but the rain that flattens my hair
theses are the things that kill me
Passed the Pub that saps your body
and the church who'll snatch your money
the Queen is dead, boys
and it's so lonely on a limb
Pass the Pub that wrecks your body
and the church-all they want is your money
the Queen is dead, boys`
you can trust me, boys
life is very long, when you're lonely
life is very long, when you're lonely...

 

FRANKLY MR.SHANKLY

Frankly, Mr Shankly, this position Ive held
it pays my way, but it corrodes my soul
I want to leave you will not miss me
I want to go down in musical history
Frankly, Mr Shankly, Im a sickening wreck
Ive got the 21st Century breathing down my neck
I must move fast, you understand me
I want to go down in celluloid history
Fame, Fame, fatal Fame
it can play hideous tricks on the brain
but still I rather be Famous
than righteous or holy, any day
but sometimes Id feel more fulfilled
making Christmas cards with the mentally ill
I want to Live and I want to Love
I want to catch something that I might be ashamed of
Frankly, Mr Shankly, this position I've held
it pays my way and it corrodes my soul
oh, I didnt realise that you wrote poetry
(I didnt realise you wrote such bloody awful poetry)
Frankly, Mr Shankly, since you ask
you are a flatulent pain the arse
I do not mean to be so rude
but still, I must speck frankly, Mr Shankly

 

I KNOW IT'S ALL OVER

Oh Mother, I can fell the soil falling over my head
and as i climb into an empty bed
Oh well, Enough said
I know it's over-still I cling
I don't know where else I can go
Oh Mother, I can feel the soil falling over my head
see, the sea want s to take me
the knife wants to cut me
do you think you can help me?
Sad veiled bride, please be happy
handsome groom, give her room
loud, loutish lover, treat her kindly
(although she needs you
more than she loves you)
and I know it's over
and it never really began
but in my heart it was so real
and you even spoke to me and said:
"If you're so funny
then why are you on your own tonight?
and if you are so clever
then why are you on your own tonight?
if you're so terribly good looking
then why do you sleep alone tonight?
because tonight is just like any other night
that's why you're on your own tonight
with your triumphs and your charms
while they are in each other's arms.."
It's so easy to laugh
it's so easy to hate
it takes strength to be gentle and kind
It's so easy to laugh
it's so easy to hate
it takes guts to be gentle and kind
love is Natural and Real
but not for you, my love
not tonight my love
love is Natural and Real
but not for such as you and I, my love
Oh Mother, I can fell the soil falling over my head
Oh Mother, I can fell the soil falling over my head...

 

NEVER HAD NO ONE EVER

When you walk without ease
on these
the very streets where you were raised
I had a really bad dream
it lasted 20 years, 7 months, and 27 days
Never had no one ever.

 

CEMETERY GATES

A dreaded sunny day
so I meet you at the cemetry gates
Keats and Yeats are on your side
A dreaded sunny day
so I meet you at the cemetry gates
Keats and Yeats are on your side
while Wilde is on mine
So we go inside and we gravely read the stones
all those people all those lives
where are they now ?
with loves, and hates
and passions just like mine
they were born
and then they lived and then they died
which seems so unfair
and I wantr to crv
You say: "ere thrice the sun hath done salutation to the dawn"
and you claim these words as your own
but Im well-read, have heard them said
a hundred times (maybe less, maybe more)
if you must write prose/poems
the words you use should be your own
dont plagiarise or take "on loans"
there's alweays someone, somewhere
with a big nose, who knows
and who trips you up and laughs
when you fall
You say: "ere long done do does did "
words which could only be your own
you then produce the text
from whence was ripped
(some dizzy whore, 1804)
A dreaded sunny day
so let's go where we're happy
so I meet you at the cemetry gates
Keats and Yeats are on your side
A dreaded sunny day
so let's go where we're wanted
so I meet you at the cemetry gates
Keats and Yeats are on your side
but you lose
because Wilde is on mine

 

BIGMOUTH STRIKES AGAIN

Sweetness, sweetness I was only joking
when I said Id like to smash every tooth
in your head
Sweetness, sweetness I was only joking
when I said by right s you should be
bludgeoned in your bed
and now I know how Joan of Arc felt
now I know how Joan of Arc felt
as the flames roseto her roman nose
and her Walkman stared to melt
Bibmouth, bigmouth
bigmouth strikes again
and Ive got no right to take my place
with the Human race
and now I know how Joan of Arc felt
now I know of Joan of Arc felt
as the flames rose to her roman nose
and her hearing aid started to melt
Bigmouth, bigmouth
bigmouth strikes again
and Ive got no right to take my place
with the Human race

 

THE BOY WITH A THORN IN HIS SIDE

The boy with the thorn in his side
behind the hatred there lies
a murderous desire for love
how can they look into my eyes
and still they dont believe me
how can they hear me say those words
and still they dont believe me
and if they don't believe me now
will they ever believe me?
and if they don't believe me now
will they ever believe me?
The boy with the thorn in his side
behind the hatred there lies
a plundering desire for love
how can they see the Love in our eyes
and still they don't believe us
and after all this time
they don't want to believe us
and if they dont believe us now
will they ever believe us ?
andd when you want to Live
how do you start ?
where do you go ?
who do you know?

 

VICAR IN A TUTU

I was minding mind business
lifting some lead off
the roof of the Holy Name church
it was worthwhile living a laughable life
just to set my eyes on a blistering sight
of a vicar in a tu-tu
he's not strange
he just wants to live his life this way
a scanty bit of a thing
with a decorative ring
that wouldn't cover the head of a child
as Rose collects the money in the cannister
who comes sliding down the bannister
the vicar in a tu-tu
he's not strange
he just wants to live his life this way
the monkish monsignor
with a head full of plaster
said "my man, get your vile soul dry-cleaned"
as Rose counts the money in the cannister
as natural as rain
he dances again
vicar in a tu-tu
The next day in the pulpit
with Freedom and Ease
combating ignoranca,dust and disease
as Rose counts the money in the cannister
as natural as rain
he dances again
the fabric of a tu-tu
any man could get us to
and I am a living sign.

 

THERE IS A LIGHT THAT NEVER GOES OUT

Take me out tonight
where there's music and there's people
who are young and alive
driving in your car
I never never want to go home
because I havent got one
anymore
take me out tonight
because I want to see people and I
want to see lights
driving in your car
oh please dont drop me home
because it's not my home, it's their
home, and Im welcome no morw
and if a double-decker bus
crashes in to us
to die by your side
such a heavenly way to die
and if a ten ton truck
kills the both of us
to die by your side
the pleasure and the privilege is mine
take me out tonight
oh take me anywhere, I dont care
and in the darken underpass
I thought Oh God, my chance has come at last
(but then a strange fear gripped me and I just couldn't ask)
take me out tonight
take me anywhere, I dont care
just driving in your car
I never never want to go home
because I havent got one
I havent got one.

 

SOME GIRLS ARE BIGGER THAN OTHERS

From the ice-age to the dole-age
there is but one concern
and I have just discover
some girls are bigger than others
some girls are bigger than others
some girls mothers are bigger than
other girls mothers
As Anthony said to Cleopatra
as he opened a crate of ale:
some girls are bigger than others
some girls are bigger than others
some girls mothers are bigger than
other girls mothers.

 

A RUSH AND A PUSH AND AND THE LAND IS OURS

HELLO
I am the ghost of Troubled Joe
hung by his pretty white neck
some eighteen months ago
I travelled to a mystical time zone
but I missed my bed
so I soon came home
they said:
"there's too much caffeine
in your bloodstream
and a lack of real spice
in your life"
I said:
"leave me alone
because I'm alright, dad
just surprised to still
be on my own...."
Ooh, but don't mention love
I'd hate the real strain of the pain again
a rush and a push and the land that
we stand on is ours
it has been before
so it shall be again
and people who are uglier than you and I
they take what they need, and leave
Ooh, but don't mention love
I'd hate the pain and the strain all over again
a rush and a push and the land that
we stand on is ours
it has been before
so why can't it be now?
and people who are weaker than you and I
they take what they want from life
Ooh, but don't mention love
no - just don't mention love!
a rush and a push and the land that
we stand on is ours
your youth may be gone
but you're still a young man
so phone me, phone me, phone me
so phone me, phone me, phone me
Ooh, I think I'm in love...
Urrgh, I think I'm in lerv

 

I STARTED SOMETHING I COULDN'T FINISH

The lanes were silent
with nothing or no one around for miles
I doused our friendly venture
with a hard-faced
three-word gesture
I started something
I forced you into a zone
and you were clearly
never meant to go
hair brushed and parted
typical me, typical me, typical me
I started something
...and now I'm not too sure
I grabbed you by the guilded beams
that's what Tradition means
and I doused another venture
with a gesture
that was...absolutely vile
I started something
forced you to a zone
and you were clearly
never meant to go
hair brushed and parted
typical me, typical me, typical me
I started something
...and now I'm not too sure
I grabbed you by the guilded beams
that's what Tradition means
and now eighteen months' hard-labour
seems...fair enough
I started something
forced you to a zone
and you were clearly
never meant to go
hair brushed and parted
typical me, typical me, typical me
I started something
and now I'm not too sure

 

DEATH OF A DISCO DANCER

The death of a disco dancer
well, it happens a lot 'round here
and if you think Peace
is a common goal
well, that goes to show
just how little you know
The death of a disco dancer
well, I'd rather not get involved
I never talk to my neighbour
I'd just rather not get involved
Love, peace and harmony?
Love, peace and harmony?
Oh, very nice, very nice, very nice, very nice
...but maybe in the next world.

 

GIRLFRIEND IN A COMA

Girlfriend in a coma, I know
I know - it's serious
Girlfriend in a coma, I know
I know - it's really serious
there wree times when I could
have 'murdered' her
(but, you know, I would hate
anything to happen to her)
NO, I DON'T WANT TO SEE HER
Do you really think
she'll pull through?
Do you really think
she'll pull through?
Girlfriend in a coma, I know
I know, it's serious
there were time when I could
have 'strangeled' her
(but, you know, I would hate
anything to happen to her)
WOULD YOU PLEASE LET ME SEE HER!
Do you really think she'll pull through?
Do you really think she'll pull through?
Let me wisper my last goodbyes
I know - IT'S SERIOUS

 

STOP ME IF YOU'VE HEARD THIS ONE BEFORE

Stop me, stop me,
stop me if you think that you've heard this one before
stop me, stop me
stop me if you think that you've heard this one before
nothing's changed
I still love you, oh I still love you
...only slightly less than I used to
I was delayed, I was way-laid
an emergency stop
I smelt the last ten seconds of life
I crashed down on the crossbar
and the pain was enough to make
a shy, bald buddhist reflect
and plan a mass-murder
who said I'd lied to her?
who said I'd lied because I never
who said I'd lied because I never
I was detained, I was restrained
he broke my spleen
he broke my knees
(and then he really laid into me)
Friday night in Out-patients
who said I'd lied to her?
who said I'd lied - because I never
who said I'd lied - because I never
Oh, so I drank one
or was it four
and when I fell on the floor
...I drank more
stop me, stop me
stop me if you think that you've heard this one before
nothing's changed
I still love you, I still love you
but only slightly
less than I used to

 

LAST NIGHT I DREAMT THAT SOMEBODY LOVED ME

Last night I dreamt
that somebody loved me
no hope - but no harm
just another false alarm
Las night I felt
real arms around me
no hope - no harm
just another false alarm
so, tell me how long
before the last one?
and tell me how long
before the right one?
this story is old - I KNOW
but it goes on
this story is old - I KNOW
but it goes on

 

UNHAPPY BIRTHDAY

I've come to wish you an unhappy birthday
I've come to wish you an unhappy birthday
because you're evil
and you lie
and if you should die
I may feel slightly sad
(but I won't cry)
Loved and lost
and some may say
when usually its Nothing
surely you're happy
it should be this way?
I say "No, I'm gonna kill my dog"
and: "May the lines sag heavy
and deep tonight XXX"
I've come to wish you an unhappy birthday
I've come to wish you an unhappy birthday
because you're evil
and you lie
and if you should die
I may feel slightly sad
(But I won't cry)
Loved and lost
some people say
when usually its Nothing
surely you're happy
it should be this way?
I said "No"
and then I shot myself
so, drink, drink, drink
and be ill tonight
from the one you left behind
from the one you left behind...

 

PAINT A VULGAR PICTURE

At the record company meeting
On their hands - a dead star
and ooh, the plans that they weave
and ooh, the sikening greed
At the record company meeting
on their hands - a dead star
the sycophantic slags all say:
"I knew him first, and I knew him well"
Re-issue! Re-package! Re-package!
Re-evaluate the songs
double-pack with a photograph
Extra Track (and a tacky badge)
A-list, playlist
"Please them, please them!"
"Please them! Please them!"
(sadly, THIS was your life)
but you could have said no
if you'd wanted to
you could have said no
if you'd wanted to
BPI, MTV, BBC
"Please them! Please them!"
(sadly this was your life)
but you could have said no
if you'd wanted to
you could have walked away
...couldn't you?
I touched you at the soundcheck
you had no real way of knowing
in my heart I bgged "please, take
me with you...
I don't care where you're going"
But to you I was faceless
I was fawning, I was boring
just a child from those ugly new houses
who could never begin to know
who could never really know
Best of? Most of?
Satiate the need
slip them into different sleeves!
Buy both, and be decieved
climber - new entry, re-entry
World tour! ("media whore")
"Please the Press in Belgium!"
(THIS was your life...)
and when it fails to recoup?
Well, maybe:
You just haven't earned it yet, baby
I walked a pace behind you at the soundcheck
you're just the same as I am
what makes most people feel happy
leads us headlong into harm
so, in my bedroom in those 'ugly new houses'
I dance my legs down to the knees
but me and my 'true love'
we will never meet again...
At the record company meeting
on their hands - at last! - a dead star!
but they cannot taint you in my eyes
no, they cannout touch you now
No, they cannot hurt you my darling
they cannot touch you now
but me and my 'true love'
will never meet again

 

DEATH AT ONE'S ELBOW

Ooh Glenn, don't come to the house tonight
Ooh, Glenn, don't come to the house tonight
because there's somebody here
who really really loves you
stay home
be bored
(it's crap, I KNOW)
Ooh, Glenn, don't come to the house tonight
Ooh, Glen, don't come to the house tonight
because there's somebody here
who'll take a hatchet to your ear
how the frustration renders me
hateful, Glenn!
don't come to the house tonight
don't come to the house tonight
because you'll slip on the
trail of my bespattered remains
and so, that's why
GOODBYE MY LOVE, GOODBYE MY LOVE, GOODBYE MY LOVE...
Belch

 

I WON'T SHARE YOU

I won't share you
I won't share you
with the drive and ambition
and the zeal I feel
this is my time
as the note I wrote
was read, she said
has the Perrier gone
straight to my head
or is life plainly sick and cruel, instead?
"YES!"
No-no-no-no-no-no
I won't share you
I won't share you
with the drive and the dreams inside
this is my time
Life tends to come and go
well, that's OK
just as long as you know
Life tends to come and go
well, that's OK
just as long as you know
I won't share you
I won't share you
with the drive and the dreams inside
this is my time, this is my time

PANIC

Panic on the streets of London
Panic on the streets of Birmingham
I wonder to myself
Could life ever be sane again
on the Leeds side-streets that you slip down
I wonder to myself
Hopes may rise on the Grasmeres
But Honey Pie, you're not safe here
So you run down
To the safety of the town
But there's Panic on the streets of Carlisle
Dublin, Dundee, Humberside
I wonder to myself
Burn down the Disco
Hang the blessed D.J.
Because the music that they constantly play
IT SAYS NOTHING TO ME ABOUT MY LIFE
Hang the blessed D.J.
Because the music they constantly play
On the Leeds side-streets that you slip down
On the provincial towns that you jog 'round
Hang the D.J.,. Hang the D.J.,.Hang the D.J...

ASK

Shyness is nice, but
Shyness can stop you
From doing all the things in life
That you'd like to
So, if there's something you'd like to try
ASK ME-I WON'T SAY "NO"-HOW COULD I?
Coyness is nice, but ,
Coyness can stop you
from saying all the things in
life that you want to
If there's something that you'd like to try
ASK ME-I WON'TSAY"NO"-HOW COULD I?
Spending warm, Summer days indoors
Writing fringhtening verse
To a buck-toothed girl in Luxembourg
ASK ME, ASK ME ,ASK ME, ASK ME, ASK ME ,ASK ME
Because if it's not Love
Then it's the Bomb
That will bring us together
Nature is a language-can't you read?

MARIE'S THE NAME (HIS LATEST FLAME) / RUSHOLME RUFFIANS

Very old friend 
Came by today 
As he was telling everyone in town 
Of all the love that he'd just found 
And Marie's the name (of his latest flame) 
Talked and talked 
And I heard him say 
That she had the longest blackest hair 
Prettiest green eyes anywhere 
And Marie's the name (of his latest flame) 
The last night of the fair 
By the big wheel generator 
A boy is stabbed 
His money is grabbed 
And the air hangs heavy like a dulling wine 
She is Famous 
She is Funny 
An engagement ring 
Doesn't mean a thing 
To a mind consumed by brass (money), oh 
The last night of the fair 
From a seat on a whirling waltzer 
Her skirt ascends for a watching eye 
It's a hideous trait (on her mother's side)
From a seat on a whirling waltzer 
Her skirt ascends for a watching eye 
A hideous trait (on her mother's side) 
Then someone falls in love 
Someone's beaten up 
Someone's beaten up 
And the senses being dulled are mine 
And someone falls in love 
Someone's beaten up 
And the senses being dulled are mine 
This is the last night of the fair 
And the grease in the hair 
Of a speedway operator 
Is all a tremulous heart requires 
A schoolgirl is denied 
She said : "How quickly would I die 
If I jumped from the top of the parachutes ?"
This is the last night of the fair 
And the grease in the hair 
Of a speedway operator 
Is all a tremulous heart requires 
A schoolgirl is denied 
She said : "How quickly would I die 
Oh, if I jumped from the top of the parachutes ?"
...Oh, walk home alone 
I might walk home alone 
But my faith in love is still devout

RUBBER RING / WHAT SHE SAID

Yeah! What she says : 
"How come someone hasn't noticed 
That I'm dead 
And decided to bury me ? 
God knows, I'm ready !"
La-la-la ... 
What she said was sad 
But then, all the rejection she's had 
To pretend to be happy 
Could only be idiocy 
La-la-la ... 
What she said was not for the job or 
Lover that she never had 
No no no ... 
What she read 
All heady books 
She'd sit and prophesise 
(It took a tattooed boy from 
Birkenhead 
To really really open her eyes)

IS IT REALLY SO STRANGE?

I left the North 
I travelled South 
I found a tiny house 
And I can't help the way I feel 
Oh yes, you can kick me 
And you can punch me 
And you can break my face 
But you won't change the way I feel 
'Cause I love you, Oh ... 
And is it really so strange ? 
Oh, is it really so strange ? 
Oh, is it really so, really so strange ? 
I say NO, you say YES 
(and you will change your mind) 
I left the South 
I travelled North 
I got confused - I killed a horse 
I can't help the way I feel 
Oh yes, you can punch me 
And you can butt me 
And you can break my spine 
But you won't change the way I feel 
'Cause I love you, Oh ... 
And is it really so strange ? 
Oh, is it really so strange ? 
Oh, is it really so, really so strange ? 
I say NO, you say YES 
(But you will change your mind) 
I left the North again 
I travelled South again 
And I got confused - I killed a nun 
I CAN'T HELP THE WAY I FEEL 
(I lost my bag in Newport Pagnell) 
Why is the last mile the hardest mile ? 
My throat was dry, with the sun in my eyes 
And I realised, I realised 
I could never 
I could never, never, never, go back home again

 

CEMETERY GATES

A dreaded sunny day
so I meet you at the cemetry gates
Keats and Yeats are on your side
A dreaded sunny day
so I meet you at the cemetry gates
Keats and Yeats are on your side
while Wilde is on mine
So we go inside and we gravely read the stones
all those people all those lives
where are they now ?
with loves, and hates
and passions just like mine
they were born
and then they lived and then they died
which seems so unfair
and I wantr to crv
You say: "ere thrice the sun hath done salutation to the dawn"
and you claim these words as your own
but Im well-read, have heard them said
a hundred times (maybe less, maybe more)
if you must write prose/poems
the words you use should be your own
dont plagiarise or take "on loans"
there's alweays someone, somewhere
with a big nose, who knows
and who trips you up and laughs
when you fall
You say: "ere long done do does did "
words which could only be your own
you then produce the text
from whence was ripped
(some dizzy whore, 1804)
A dreaded sunny day
so let's go where we're happy
so I meet you at the cemetry gates
Keats and Yeats are on your side
A dreaded sunny day
so let's go where we're wanted
so I meet you at the cemetry gates
Keats and Yeats are on your side
but you lose
because Wilde is on mine

 

LONDON

Smoke
Lingers 'round your fingers
Train
Heave on - to Euston
Do you think you've made
The right decision this time?
You left
Your tired family grieving
And you think they're sad because you're leaving
But didn't you see the Jealousy in the eyes
Of the ones who had to stay behind?
And do you think you've made
The right decision thins time?
You left
Your girlfriend on the platform
With thei really ragged notion that you'll return
But she knows
That when he goes
He really goes
So do you think you've made
The right decision this time?

 

I KNOW IT'S OVER

I can feel the soil falling over my head 
And as I climb into an empty bed 
Oh well. Enough said. 
I know it's over - still I cling 
I don't know where else I can go 
Over ... 
Oh Mother, I can feel the soil falling over my head 
See, the sea wants to take me 
The knife wants to cut me 
Do you think you can help me ? 
Sad veiled bride, please be happy 
Handsome groom, give her room 
Loud, loutish lover, treat her kindly 
(Though she needs you 
More than she loves you) 
And I know it's over - still I cling 
I don't know where else I can go 
Over, it's over, it's over, it's over 
It's over, la ... 
I know it's over 
And it never really began 
But in my heart it was so real
And you even spoke to me, and said : 
"If you're so funny 
Then why are you on your own tonight ? 
And if you're so clever 
Then why are you on your own tonight ? 
I know ... 
'Cause tonight - it's just like any other night 
That's why you're on your own tonight 
Your triumphs and your charms 
While they're in each other's arms..."
It's so easy to laugh 
It's so easy to hate 
It takes strength to be gentle and kind 
Over, over, over, over 
It's so easy to laugh 
It's so easy to hate 
It takes guts to be gentle and kind 
Over, over 
Love is Natural and Real 
But not for you, my love 
Not tonight, my love 
Love is Natural and Real 
But not for such as you and I, my love 
Oh Mother, I can feel the soil falling over my head...
Oh Mother, I can feel the soil fall over, fall over my head 
Oh Mother, I can feel the ... fall over my ... , Oh ...

 

THE DRAIZE TRAIN

A vastly superior version of the instrumental B-side, acting as a peace 
offering to Marr (Morrissey chose the tracks for the compilation, 
and of course, receives no royalties on this track).

 

STILL ILL

I decree today that life
is simply taking and not giving
England is mine and it owes me a living
ask me why, and I'll spit in your eye
ask me why, and I'll spit in your eye
but we cannot cling to the old dreams anymore
no, we cannot cling to the old dreams anymore
Does the body rule the mind
or does the mind rule the body?
I dunno...
Under the iron bridge we kissed
and although I ended up with sore lips
it just wasn't like the old days anymore
no, it wasn't like those days
am I still ill?
Does the body rule the mind
or does the mind rule the body ?
I dunno...
Ask me why, and I'll die
ask me why, and I'll die
and if you must go to work tomorrow
well, if I were you I wouldn't bother
for there are brighter sides to life
and I should know because I've seen them
but not very often...
under the iron bridge we kissed
and although I ended up with sore lips
it just wasn't like the old days anymore
no, it wasn't like those days
am I still ill?

 

BIGMOUTH STRIKES AGAIN

Sweetness, sweetness I was only joking
when I said Id like to smash every tooth
in your head
Sweetness, sweetness I was only joking
when I said by right s you should be
bludgeoned in your bed
and now I know how Joan of Arc felt
now I know how Joan of Arc felt
as the flames roseto her roman nose
and her Walkman stared to melt
Bibmouth, bigmouth
bigmouth strikes again
and Ive got no right to take my place
with the Human race
and now I know how Joan of Arc felt
now I know of Joan of Arc felt
as the flames rose to her roman nose
and her hearing aid started to melt
Bigmouth, bigmouth
bigmouth strikes again
and Ive got no right to take my place
with the Human race

 
ALSATIAN COUSTIN

Were you and he Lovers?
and would you say so if you were?
on a forecourt
on a Friday
passing my way
Were you and he Lovers?
and if you were, then say that you were!
on a groundsheet
under canvas
with your tent-flap
open wide
A note upon his desk:
"P.S. Bring Me Home And Have Me!"
Leather elbows on a tweed coat
- Oh! -
Is THAT the best you can do?
So came his reply:
"...but on the desk is where I want you!"
So I ask (even though I know):
were you and he Lovers?

 

LITTLE MAN, WHAT NOW?

An afternoon nostalgia
television show
you spoke in silhouette
(but they couldn't name you)
although the panel were
very polite to you
but I remembered you
from Friday nights 1969
ATV - you murdered every line
too old to be a child star
too young to take leads
four seasons passed
and they AXED you
nervously juvenile
(WON'T SMILE!)
What became of you?
did that swift eclipse torture you?
a star at eighteen
and then-suddenly gone
down to a few lines
in the back page of a teenage annual
oh but I remembered you
I looked up to you

 

EVERYDAY IS LIKE SUNDAY

Trudging slowly over wet sand
back to the bench
where your clothes were stolen
this is the coastal town
that they forgot to close down
Armageddon - come Armageddon!
Come Armageddon! Come!
Everyday is like Sunday
everyday is silent and grey
Hide on the promenade
scratch out a postcard
"how I dearly with I was not here"
in the seaside town
...that they forgot to bomb
Come! Come! Come - nuclear bomb!
Everyday is like Sunday
everyday is silent and grey
Trudging back over pebbles and sand
and a strange dust lands on your hands
(and on your face)
Everyday is like Sunday
"Win Yourself A Cheap Tray"
share some greased tea with me
everyday is silent and grey

 

BENGALI IN PLATFORMS

No no no
he does not want to depress you
oh no no no no no
he only wants to impress you
Bengali in platform
she only wants to embrace your culture
and to be your friend forever
Bengali, Bengali
oh shelve your Western plans
and understand that life is hard enough when you belong here
A silver-studded rim that glistens
and an ankle-star that...blinds me
a lemon sole so very high
which only reminds me, to tell you
so I break the news gently
I break the news to you gently
"Shelve your plans"
Bengali, Bengali
its the touchy march of time
that blinds you
don't blame me
don't hate me
just because I'm the one to tell you
that life is hard enough when you belong here
life is hard enough when you belong here
shelve your western plans
life is hard enough when you belong here

 

ANGEL, ANGEL, DOWN WE GO TOGETHER

Angel, Angel
don't take your life tonight
I know they take
and that they take in turn
and they give you nothing real
for yourself in return
and when they've used you
and they've broken you
and wasted all your money
and cast your shell aside
and when they've bought you
and they've sold you
and they've billed you for the pleasure
and they've made your parents cry
I will be here
BELIEVE ME
I will be here
...believe me
Angel, don't take your life
some people have got no pride
they do not understand
the Urgency of life
but I love you more than life
I love you more than life
I love you more than life
I love you more than life

 

LALE NIGHT, MAUDLIN STREET

The last night on Maudlin Street
goodbye house
goodbye stairs
I was born here
I was raised here, and
...I took some stick here
love at first sight
may sound trite
but it's true, you know
I could list the details
of everything you ever wore
or said, or how you stood that day
and as we spend the last night
on Maudlin Street, I say
"goodbye house-forever!"
I never stole a happy hour
around here
Where the world's ugliest boy
became what you see
here I am - the ugliest man
Its the last night on Maudlin Street
and truly I do love you
oh, truly I do love you
When I sleep with that picture of
you framed beside my bed
oh, it's childish and it's silly
but I think it's you in my room
by the bed (...yes, I told you it was silly...)
and I know
I took strange pills
but I never meant to hurt you
oh truly I love you
I came home late one night
everyone had gone to bed
nobody stays up for you
when you have sixteen stitches
all around your head
the last buss I missed to Maudlin Street
so, he drove me home in the Van
complaining: "Women only like me for my mind..."
don't leave your torch behind
power-cuts ahead
as we crept through the park
but no I cannot steal a pair of jeans
off a clothesline for you
but you...without clothes
oh I could not keep a straight face
me - without clothes?
well a nation turns its back and gags...
I'm packed
I am moving house
a half-life disappears today
every slag waves me on
(secretly wishing me gone
well, I will be soon
oh - I will be soon)
There were bad times on Maudlin Street
when they took you away in a police car
dear Inspector - don't you know?
don't you care?
don't you know - about Love?
Your gran died
and your mother died
on Maudlin Street
in pain and ashamed
with never time to say
those special things
I took the keys from Maudlin Street
well, it's only bricks and mortar!
and...truly I do love you
wherever you are
wherever you are

 

SUEDHEAD

Why do you come here
why do you hang around
I'm so sorry
I'm so sorry
Why do you come here
when you know it makes
things hard for me
when you know, oh
why do you come?
Why do you telephone?
and why send me silly notes?
I'm so sorry
I'm so sorry
why do you come here
when you know it makes
thing hard for me
when you know, oh
why do you come?
You had to sneak into my room
'just' to read my diary
was it just to see all the things
you knew I'd written about you?
and...so many illustrations
I'm so very sickened
oh, I am so sickened NOW

 

BREAK UP THE FAMILY

The strange logic of your clumsiest line
stayed emblazoned on my mind
break up the family
and lets begin to live our lives
I went to see all my friends tonight
it wasn't Youth, it wasn't even Life
born Old, sadly wise
resigned (well, we were)
to ending our lives
I'm so glad to grow older
to move away from those awful times
I want to see all my friends tonight
Yes you found love but you weren't
at peace with your life
home late, full of Hate
despise the ties that bind
oh I'm so glad to grow older
to move away from those younger years
now I'm in love for the first time
and I don't feel bad
Let me see all my old friends
let me put my arm around them
because I really do love them
now, does that sound mad?
Captain of games, solid framed
I stood on the touchline
hailstones, driven home
in his car - no breaks? I don't mind
I'm just so glad to grow older
to move away from those darker years
I'm in love for the first time
and I don't feel bad
so wish me luck my friends
goodbye

 

HAIRDRESSER ON FIRE

Here is London
here is London
is it home of the free,
or what?
can you squeeze me
into an empty page of your diary
and psychologically save me
I've got faith in you
I sense the power
in the fingers
within an hour the power
can totally destroy me
or it could same my life
here is London
'home of the brash, outrageous
and free'
you are repressed
but you're remarkably dressed
is it Real?
but you're far to busy
busy scissors
busy clippers
hair dresser on fire
all around Sloane Square
and you're far too busy
to see me
"busy,busy"
hairdresser on fire
was a client over-cautious
he made you nervous
and when he said
"I'm gonna sue you"
I really felt for you
so can you squeeze me
into an empty page of your diary
and supernaturally change me
CHANGE ME, CHANGE ME

 

THE ORDINARY BOYS

Ordinary boys, happy knowing nothing
happy being no one, but themselves
Ordinary girls, supermarket clothes
who think it's very clever to be cruel to you
for you were so different
you stood all alone
and you knew
that it had to be so
avoiding ordinary boys
happy going nowhere, just around here
in their rattling cars
and ordinary girls
never seeing further
than the cold, small streets
that trap them
but you were so different
you had to say no
when those empty fools
tried to change you, and claim you
for the lair of their ordinary world
where they feel so lucky
so lucky, so lucky
with their lives laid out before them
they're so lucky, so lucky
so lucky, so lucky

 

I DON'T MIND IF YOU FORGET ME

I don't mind
I don't mind if you forget me
having learned my lesson
I never left an impression on anyone
so now you send me your hardened 'regards'
when once you'd send me 'love'
sincerely I must tell you
your mild 'best wishes'
they make me suspicious
but I don't mind
I don't mind if you forget me
having learned my lesson
I never left
an impression on anyone
the pressure to change, to move on
was strange
and very strong
so this is why I tell you
I really do understand
BYE BYE
I don't mind if you forget me
no no no no no no no
REJECTION IS ONE THING
BUT REJECTION FROM A FOOL
IS CRUEL
REJECTION IS ONE THING
BUT REJECTION FROM A FOOL
IS CRUEL
and I don't mind if you forget me
I don't mind if your forget me

 

DIAL-A-CLICHE

Further into the fog I fall
well, I was just
following you!
when you said:
"Do as I do and scrap your fey ways"
(dial-a-cliche)
"grow up, be a man, and close your mealy-mouth!"
(dial-a-cliche)
But the person underneath
where does he go?
does he slide by the wayside?
or...does he just die?
when you find that you've organized
your feelings, for people
who didn't like you then
and certainly don't like you now
yet still you say:
"Do as I do and scrap your fey ways"
(dial-a-cliche)
"grow up, be a man, and close your mealy-mouth!"
(dial-a-cliche)
"the Safe way is the only way!
there's always time to change, son!"
yes well I've changed
but I'm in pain!
dial-a-chiche

 

MARGARET ON THE GUILLOTINE

The kind people
have a wonderful dream
Margaret on the guillotine
because people like you
make me feel so tired
when will you die?
when will you die?
when will you die?
when will you die?
when will you die?
because people like you
make me feel so old inside
please die
and kind people
do not shelter this dream
make it real
make the dream real
make the dream real
make it real

 

OUR FRANK

Our frank and open
deep conversations
they get me nowhere
they bring me down, so
give it a rest, won't you?
give me a cigarette
God give me patience
just no more conversation
Give us a drink
and make it quick
or else I'm gonna be sick
sick all over
your frankly vulgar
red pullover
now see how the colours blend
Our frank and open
deep conversations
they get me nowhere
they bring me down, so
give it a rest, won't you?
now will you just give over
the world may be ending
but look, I'm only human
Give us a drink
and make it quick
or else I'm gonna be sick
all over
your frankly vulgar
red pullover
now see how the two colours blend
Won't somebody stop me
from thinking all the time
about everything
so deeply
so bleakly

 

ASIAN RUT

Day oh so late
strangely the sun still shone
oh Asian boy
what are you on?
Day oh so late
strangely the sun still shone
what drugs are you on?
Tooled-up Asian boy
has come here to avenge
the cruel, cold killing
of his very best friend
Tooled-up Asian boy
has come here to take revenge
for the cruel, cold killing
of his only friend
Peace through the school
so quiet in the hall
it's a strange sign for one
of what's to come
Tough and hard and pale
oh they may just impale you on railings
oh English boys
it must be wrong
three against one?
Brakes slammed, and
a gun jammed, and
as far as I could tell
brave Asian boy
dealt a blow and fell
I'm just passing through here
on my way to somewhere civilised
and maybe I'll even arrive
maybe I'll even arrive?

 

SING YOUR LIFE

Sing your life
any fool can think of words that rhyme
many others do
why don't you?
do you want to?
Sing your life
just walk right up to the microphone
and name
all the things that you love
all the things that you loathe
sing your life
all the things that you love
all the things that you loathe
oh sing your life
oh sing your life
Others sang your life
but now's your chance to shine
and have the pleasure of
saying what you mean
the rare pleasure of
meaning what you sing
oh, make no mistake, my friend
all of this will end
so sing it now
all the things you love
all the things you loathe
oh sing your life
all the things that you love
all the things that you loathe
oh sing your, oh sing your
Don't leave it all unsaid
somewhere in the wasteland of your head
and make no mistake, my friend
your pointless life will end
but before you go
can you look at the truth?
You have a lovely singing voice
a lovely singing voice
and all of those
who sing on key
they stole the notion
from you and me

 

MUTE WITNESS

Your poor witness
crying so loudly on the floor
oh but she's only trying to tell you
what it was that she saw
she is only trying to tell you
what it was that she saw
Now see her standing on the table
with her small arms flailing
and you feel such compassion
in your soul for
Your poor mute witness
still testing the strength
of our patience
oh but she's only trying to tell you
what it was that she saw
Now see her pointing to the frisbee
with a memory too fuzzy
as her silent words
describe the fright of last night
4 a.m. Norhtside, Clapham Common
who knows what she was doing there?
will she sketch the answer later?
Well, I'll ask her
"now dry your tears, my dear"
Now see her mime in time so nicely
it would all have been so clear
is only she had never volunteered
"your taxi is here, my dear"

 

KING LEER

Your boyfriend, he
went down on one knee
well, could it be
he's only got one knee?
I tried to surprise you
with Vodka
or, Tizer
I can't quite remember
but you didn't thank me
you didn't even thank me
because you never do
Your boyfriend, he
has the gift of the gab
or, could it be
the gift of the grab?
I tried to surprise you
I lay down beside you
and...nothing much happened
and you didn't phone me
you didn't even phone me
because it's not your style
to dial
Your boyfriend, he
displays to me
more than just
a hint of cruelty
I tried to surprise you
I crept up behind you
with a homeless chihuahua
you gushed for an hour
you handed him back and said
"You'll never guess
I'm bored now"

 

FOUND FOUND FOUND

found found found found found found
someone who's worth it
in this murkiness
someone who's never
seeming scheming
found found found found found found
someone who's worth it
in this murkiness
someone who's never
seeming scheming
Oh, but if I'd never found
oh, but if I'd never found
oh, but if I'd never found
I do believe that
the more you give your love
and I do believe that
the more you offer trust
the more you chase
the more you cry
the more you're bound to lose
the more you're bound to lose
Oh, but if I'd never found
oh, but if I'd never found
somebody
who wants to be
who wants to be
with me
all the time

 

DRIVING YOUR GIRLFRIEND HOME

I'm driving
your girlfriend home
and she's saying
how she never chose you
"turn left", she says
so I turn left
and she says
"So how did I end up
so deeply involved in
the very existence
I planned on avoiding?"
and I can't answer
I'm driving
your girlfriend home
and she's laughing
to stop herself crying
"drive on", she says
so I drive on
and she says
"So how did I end up
attached to this person
when his sense of humour
gets gradually worser?"
and I can't tell her
I'm parking
outside her home
and we're shaking hands
goodnight, so politely

 

THE HARSH TRUTH OF THE CAMERA EYE

Churchillian legs
hair barely there
the harsh truth of the camera eye
Your eyes signal pain
because of the strain
of smiling
the harsh truth of the camera eye
telling you all
that you never wnated to know
showing what
you didn't want shown
My so friendly lens
zooms into
"the inner you"
and it tells the harsh truth
and nothing but
Laugh with us all here
that's if you can
then take the pictures home
and screamtelling you all
that you never wanted to know
showing you what
you didn't want shown
This photographer
he must have really had it in for you
"Oh, I don't want
to be judged anymore
I don't wnat to be judged
I would sooner be Loved
I would sooner be
just blindly Loved..."

 

(I'M) THE END OF THE FAMILY LINE

With no complications
fifteen generations
(of mine)
all honouring Nature
until I arrive
(with incredible style)
I'm the end fo the line
the end of the family line
the end of the line
No baby pulled screaming
out into this seething whirl
by chance or whim
(or even love?)
our family tree hacked into decline
and I'm spared the pain
of ever saying
("goodbye")
I'm the end of the line
the end of the family line
the end of the line

 

THERE'S A PLACE IN HELL FOR ME AND MY FRIENDS

There is a place
reserved
for me and my friends
and when we go
we all will go
so you see
I'm never alone
there is a place
with a bit more time
and a few more
gentler words
and looking back
we do forgive
(we had no choice
we always did)
all that we hope
is that when we go
our skin
and our blood
and our bones
don't get in your way
making you ill
the way they did
when we lived
There is a place
a place in hell
reserved
for me and my friends
and if ever I
wanted to cry
then I will
because I can

 

TONY THE PONY

Still drinking on the corner 
Just don't say I didn't warn you 
Always nagging big brother 
He's only looking out for you 
Tony The Pony 
Tony The Pony 
You're still standing on the corner 
Just don't say I didn't warn you 
Old and jealous big brother 
You had your time and you spent it 
Crying 
Now, Tony The Pony 
Tony The Pony 
So, that's what they call you now ? 
When you're free outside 
So cold and hard and in control 
And ... 
There's a free ride on 
Tony The Pony 
Oh, why do you always wanna stop me 
From doing the things in life that make me happy ? 
And when I'm outside with friends, laughing loudly 
Why do you always wanna stop me ? 
Oh, I would never 
I would never 
But you will carry the can for anyone 
The free ride on 
Gullible Tony 
You're drunker quicker 
And you're sicker even quicker 
For something heavy is gonna fall on you 
Oh ... 
And what do they call you now ? 
When you're free outside 
So cold and hard and in control 
And, oh ... been a lark 
There's a free ride on 
Fucked-up Tony 
I will never say I told you so 
Or how I knew that something bad 
Would happen to you 
I don't wanna say I told you so 
Oh, but Tony, I told you so !!! 
I told you so

 

YOU'RE GONNA NEED SOMEONE ON YOUR SIDE

With the world's fate 
Resting on your shoulder 
You're gonna need 
Someone on your side 
You can't do it by yourself 
Any longer 
You're gonna need 
Someone on your side 
Someone kindly told me 
That you'd wasted 
Eight of nine lives
Oh, give yourself a break 
Before you break down 
You're gonna need someone on your side 
And here I am, And here I am 
Well, you don't need 
To look so pleased ! 
Day or night, 
There is no difference 
You're gonna need someone on your side 
Day or night, 
There is no difference 
You're gonna need someone soon 
And here I am, And here I am 
Well, you don't need 
To look so pleased

 

GLAMOROUS GLUE

First day with the jar 
You find 
Everyone lies 
First day with the jar 
You find 
Everyone lies, nobody minds 
Everyone lies 
Where is the man you respect ? 
And where is the woman you love ? 
Where's the woman you love ? 
Third week with the jar
You find 
Everything dies 
We won't vote Conservative 
Because we never have 
Everyone lies, everyone lies 
Where is the man you respect ? 
And where is the woman you love ? 
Where's the woman you love ? 
Everything of worth 
On Earth Is there To share 
I used to dream, and I used to vow 
I wouldn't dream of it now 
We look to Los Angeles 
For the language we use 
London is dead, London is dead, London is dead...
Now I'm too much in love 
I'm too much in love 
I know 
I'll go 
Empty hand 
From the land

 

WE'LL LET YOU KNOW

How sad are we ? 
And how sad have we been ? 
We'll let you know 
We'll let you know 
Oh, but only if - you're really interested 
You wonder how 
We've stayed alive 'till now 
We'll let you know 
We'll let you know 
But only if - you're really interested 
We're all smiles 
Then, honest, I swear, it's the turnstiles 
That make us hostile 
Oh ... 
We will descend 
On anyone unable to defend 
Themselves 
Oh ... 
And the songs we sing 
They're not supposed to mean a thing 
La, la, la, la ... 
Oh ...You're lonely, Oh ... you're lonely, Oh ... 
GET OFF THE ROOF ! Oh ... 
Your Arsenal !
We may seem cold, or 
We may even be 
The most depressing people you've ever known 
At heart, what's left, we sadly know 
That we are the last truly British people you'll ever know 
We are the last truly British people you will ever know 
You'll never never want to know

 

THE NATIONAL FRONT DISCO

David, the wind blows 
The wind blows ... 
Bits of your life away 
Your friends all say ... 
"Where is our boy ? Oh, we've lost our boy" 
But they should know 
Where you've gone 
Because again and again you've explained that 
You're going to ... 
Oh, you're going to ... 
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah 
England for the English ! 
England for the English ! 
David, the winds blow 
The winds blow ...
All of my dreams away 
And I still say : 
"Where is our boy ? Ah, we've lost our boy" 
But I should know 
Why you've gone 
Because again and again you've explained
You've gone to the ... 
National, ah ... 
To the National .. 
There's a country; you don't live there 
But one day you would like to 
And if you show them what you're made of 
Oh, then you might do ... 
But David, we wonder 
We wonder if the thunder 
Is ever really gonna begin 
Begin, begin 
Your mom says : 
"I've lost my boy" 
But she should know 
Why you've gone 
Because again and again you've explained 
You've gone to the : 
National 
To the National 
To the National Front Disco 
Because you want the day to come sooner 
You want the day to come sooner 
You want the day to come sooner 
When you've settled the score 
Oh, the National 
Oh, the National

 

CERTAIN PEOPLE I KNOW

I take the cue from 
Certain people I know 
I use the cue 
And then I 
Hand it on to you 
And when I swing it 
So, it catches his eye ... 
(Weren't you there ? 
- You'd have died !) 
I trust the views of 
Certain people I know 
They look at Danger 
And they 
LAUGH THEIR HEADS OFF 
Their clothes are Imitation 
George the 23rd 
(Don't you find this absurd ?) 
I'd hate to be like 
Certain people I know 
They break their necks 
And can't afford to
Get them fixed 
Ah, they'd sacrifice all 
Of their principles for 
anything cashable 
I do believe it's terrible 
Oh, wo, wo, Ah, ah, ah, ah, Oh, wo, wo...

 

WE HATE IT WHEN OUR FRIENDS BECOME SUCCESSFUL

We hate it when our friends become successful 
We hate it when our friends become successful 
Oh, look at those clothes 
Now look at that face, it's so old 
And such a video ! 
Well, it's really laughable 
Ha, ha, ha ...
We hate it when our friends become successful 
And if they're Northern, that makes it even worse
And if we can destroy them 
You bet your life we will 
Destroy them 
If we can hurt them 
Well, we may as well ... 
It's really laughable 
Ha, ha, ha ... 
You see, it should've been me 
It could've been me 
Everybody knows 
Everybody says so 
They say : 
"Ah, you have loads of songs 
So many songs 
More songs than they'd stand 
Verse 
Chorus 
Middle eight 
Break, fade 
Just listen ..."
La, la-la, la-la

SEASICK, YET STILL DOCKED

I am a poor freezingly cold soul 
So far from where 
I intended to go 
Scavenging through life's very constant lulls 
So far from where I'm determined to go 
Wish I knew the way to reach the one I love
There is no way ... 
Wish I had the charm to attract the one I love 
But you see, I've got no charm 
Mmm...
Tonight I've consumed much more than I can hold 
Oh, this is very clear to you 
And you can tell I have never really loved 
You can tell, by the way, I sleep all day
And all of my life no-one gave me anything 
No-one has ever given me anything 
My love is as sharp as a needle in your eye 
You must be such a fool 
To pass me by

 

I KNOW IT'S GONNA HAPPEN SOMEDAY

My love, wherever you are 
Whatever you are 
Don't lose faith 
I know it's gonna happen someday 
To you 
Please wait ... Please wait ... Oh ... Wait ... 
Don't lose faith 
You say that the day just never arrives 
And it's never seemed so far away 
Still, I know it's gonna happen someday 
To you 
Please wait ... 
Don't lose faith

 

TOMORROW

Tomorrow 
Will it really come ? 
And if it does come

All I ask of you is one thing that you never do 
Would you put your arms around me ?

Tomorrow 
Does it have to come ?
All I ask of you is one thing that you'll never do 
Would you put your arms around me ? 
(I won't tell anybody) 
Tomorrow 
And what must come before ...
Oh, the pain in my arms 
Oh, the pain in my legs 
Ooh, my shiftless body 
Tomorrow 
It's surely nearer now ? 
You don't think I'll make it 
I never said I wanted to ! 
Well did I ? 
Oh, the pain in my arms 
Oh, the pain in my legs 
Oh, yeah; oh, yeah, No, yeah; no, yeah 
Through my shiftless body 
Tomorrow, Tomorrow 
All I ask of you ... oh ... 
Is : would you tell me that you love me 
Tell me, tell me that you love me, Tell me, tell me that you love me ... 
Ah, I know you don't mean it

NOVEMBER SPAWNED A MONSTER

Sleep on and dream of Love
because it's the closest you will get to love
poor twisted child, so ugly, so ugly
poor twisted child, oh hug me, oh hug me
one November spawned a monster 
in the shape of this child who later cried
"But Jesus made me, so Jesus save me from
pity, sympathy and people discussing me"
a frame of useless limbs what can make GOOD
all the BAD that's been done?
And if the lights were out
could you even bear
to kiss her full on the mouth (or anywhere?)
poor twisted child, so ugly, so ugly
poor twisted child, oh hug me, oh hug me
one November spawned a monster 
in the shape of this child who must remain
a hostage to kindess and the wheels underneath her
a hostage to kindess and the wheels underneath her
a symbol of where mad, mad lovers
must PAUSE and draw the line
So sleep and dream of love
because it's the closest
you will get to love
that November is a time which I must put OUT of my mind
oh one fine day 
LET IT BE SOON
she won't be rich or beautiful
but she'll be walking your streets
in the clothes that she went out
and chose for herself

 

SEASICK, YET STILL DOCKED

I am a poor freezingly cold soul

THE LOOP

I just wanna say 
I haven't been away 
I'm still right here 
Where I always was 
So one day, if you're bored 
By all means call 
Because you can do 
(But only if you want to) 
I just wanna say 
I haven't been away 
I am still right here 
Where I always was 
So one day, when you're bored 
By all means call 
Because you can do 
But you might not get through

 

SISTER I'M A POET

All over this town 
Yes, a low wind may blow 
And I can see through everybo... 
With no reason 
To hide these words I feel 
And no reason 
To talk about the books I read 
But still I do 
That's 'cause I'm a ... Sister I'm a ... 
All over this town 
Along this way 
Outside the prison gates 
I love the romance of crime 
And I wonder 
Does anybody feel the way I do ? 
And is evil just something you are 
Or something you do ? 
Sister I'm a ... Sister I'm a ... 
All over this town, All over this town 
They pull over 
In their Citroen vans 
Not to shake your hand 
With meths on their breaths 
And you with youth on your side 
A plastic bag stranded at the lights 
This once was me ...
But now I'm a ... Sister I'm a ...
All over this town ... Oh, oh, oh 
All over this town, All over this town, Oh ... 
I still cannot speak French ... I am very lazy

 

JACK THE RIPPER

Oh, you look so tired 
Mouth slack and wide 
Ill-housed and ill-advised 
Your face is as mean 
As your life has been 
Crash into my arms 
I WANT YOU 
You don't agree -
But you don't refuse 
I know you 
And I know a place 
Where no one is likely to pass 
Oh, you don't care if it's late 
And you don't care if you're lost 
And oh, you look so tired 
(But tonight you presumed too much) 
Too much, too much 
And if it's the last 
Thing I ever do 
I'M GONNA GET YOU 
Crash into my arms 
I WANT YOU 
You don't agree -
But you don't refuse 
I know you 
And no one knows a thing about my life 
I can come and go as I please 
And if I want to, I can stay 
Oh, or if I want to, I can leave 
Nobody knows me, Nobody knows me, Nobody knows me Oh, oh...

 

SUCH A LITTLE THING MAKES SUCH A BIG DIFFERENCE

Such a little thing, such a little thing
but the difference it made was grave
there you go
wielding a bicycle chain
oh why won't you change
cange and be nicer?
such a little thing
a gentle tone of kindness
or written words on paper
- can you write?
How I love all of
the very simple things of life
(God's good air)
how I love all of
the very simple things of life
such a little thing
a fumbling politeness
the difference it saved me
wielding a bicycle chain
"I WILL NOT CHANGE AND I WILL NOT BE NICE"
Most people keep their brains between your legs (don't you find?)
Leave me alone - I was only singing, leave me alone because
I was only singing
leave me alone - I was only singing, leave me alone
you have just proved (again)
MOST PEOPLE KEEP THEIR BRAINS BETWEEN THEIR LEGS

 

I KNOW IT'S GONNA HAPPEN SOMEDAY

My love, wherever you are 
Whatever you are 
Don't lose faith 
I know it's gonna happen someday 
To you 
Please wait ... 
Please wait ... 
Oh ... Wait ... 
Don't lose faith 
You say that the day just never arrives 
And it's never seemed so far away 
Still, I know it's gonna happen someday 
To you 
Please wait ... 
Don't lose faith

 

WE'LL LET YOU KNOW

How sad are we ? 
And how sad have we been ? 
We'll let you know, We'll let you know 
Oh, but only if - you're really interested 
You wonder how 
We've stayed alive 'till now 
We'll let you know, We'll let you know 
But only if - you're really interested 
We're all smiles 
Then, honest, I swear, it's the turnstiles 
That make us hostile 
Oh ... We will descend 
On anyone unable to defend 
Themselves 
Oh ... And the songs we sing 
They're not supposed to mean a thing 
La, la, la, la ... Oh ...
You're lonely, Oh ... you're lonely 
Oh ... 
GET OFF THE ROOF !
Oh ... Your Arsenal !
We may seem cold, or 
We may even be 
The most depressing people you've ever known 
At heart, what's left, we sadly know 
That we are the last truly British people you'll ever know 
We are the last truly British people you will ever know 
You'll never never want to know

 

SUEDHEAD

Why do you come here
why do you hang around
I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry
Why do you come here
when you know it makes
things hard for me
when you know, oh
why do you come?
Why do you telephone?
and why send me silly notes?
I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry
why do you come here
when you know it makes
thing hard for me
when you know, oh
why do you come?
You had to sneak into my room
'just' to read my diary
was it just to see all the things
you knew I'd written about you?
and...so many illustrations
I'm so very sickened
oh, I am so sickened NOW

 

HE KNOWS I'D LOVE TO SEE HIM

He Knows (he knows)
Or, I think he does
because when I lived
in the Arse of the world...
he knows, he knows, he knows I'd love
to see him happy (or as close as is allowed)
because when I lived
in the Arse of the world
he knows, he knows, he knows I'd love
to see him happy (or as close as possible
as close as possible, as close as is allowed)
My name still conjours up deadly deeds
and a bad taste in the mouth
the police - they actually knew me
they said:
"You're just another person in the world
you're just another fool with radical views
you're just another who has maddening views
you want to turn it on its head
by staying in bed!"
I said: "I know I do"

 

YOU'RE GONNA NEED SOMEONE ON YOUR SIDE

With the world's fate 
Resting on your shoulder 
You're gonna need 
Someone on your side 
You can't do it by yourself 
Any longer 
You're gonna need 
Someone on your side 
Someone kindly told me 
That you'd wasted 
Eight of nine lives
Oh, give yourself a break 
Before you break down 
You're gonna need someone on your side 
And here I am, And here I am 
Well, you don't need 
To look so pleased ! 
Day or night, 
There is no difference 
You're gonna need someone on your side 
Day or night, 
There is no difference 
You're gonna need someone soon 
And here I am, And here I am 
Well, you don't need 
To look so pleased

 

GLAMOROUS GLUE

First day with the jar

First day with the jar

And where is the woman you love ? 
Where's the woman you love ? 
Third week with the jar
You find 
Everything dies 
We won't vote Conservative 
Because we never have 
Everyone lies, everyone lies 
Where is the man you respect ? 
And where is the woman you love ? 
Where's the woman you love ? 
Everything of worth 
On Earth, Is there, To share 
I used to dream, and I used to vow 
I wouldn't dream of it now 
We look to Los Angeles 
For the language we use 
London is dead, London is dead, London is dead, ...
Now I'm too much in love 
I'm too much in love, 
I know I'll go 
Empty hand 
From the land

NOW MY HEART IS FULL

There's gonna be some trouble 
A whole house will need re-building 
And everyone I love in the house 
Will recline on an analyst's couch quite 
Soon 
Your Father cracks a joke 
And in the usual way 
Empties the room 
Tell all of my friends 
(I don't have too many 
Just some rain-coated lovers' puny brothers)
Dallow, Spicer, Pinkie, Cubitt 
Rush to danger 
Wind up nowhere 
Patric Doonan - raised to wait 
I'm tired again, I've tried again, and 
Now my heart is full 
Now my heart is full 
And I just can't explain 
So I won't even try to
Dallow, Spicer, Pinkie, Cubitt 
Every jammy Stressford poet 
Loafing oafs in all-night chemists 
Loafing oafs in all-night chemists 
Underact - express depression 
Ah, but Bunnie I loved you 
I was tired again 
I've tried again, and 
Now my heart is full 
Now my heart is full 
And I just can't explain 
So I won't even try to 
Could you pass by ? 
Could you pass by ? 
Oh ... 
Now my heart is full 
Now my heart is full 
And I just can't explain 
So ... slow ... 
Slow ... slow ... slow ... slow ... slow ...

 

SPRING-HEELED JIM

Spring-heeled Jim winks an eye 
He'll "do", he'll never be "done to" 
He takes on whoever flew through 
"Well, it's the normal thing to do" ... ah ... 
Spring-heeled Jim lives to love 
Now kissing with his mouth full 
And his eyes on some other fool 
So many women 
His head should be spinning 
Ah, but no ! 
Ah, but no ! 
But no !
Ah, no !
Spring-heeled Jim slurs the words : 
"There's no need to be so knowing
Take life at five times the 
Average speed, like I do" 
Until Jim feels the chill 
"Oh, where did all the time go ?" 
Once always in for the kill 
Now it's too cold 
And he feels too 
old 
Too old
Mmm, old... 
La, la, la, la-la, la ...

 

BILLY BUDD

Say, Billy Budd 
So you think you should ? 
Oh, everyone's laughing 
Say, Billy Budd 
So you think that you should ? 
Everyone's laughing ! 
Since I took up with you 
Things have been bad 
Yeah, but now it's 12 years on 
Now it's 12 years on 
Yes, and I took up with you 
I took my job application 
Into town 
Did you hear ? They turned me down 
Yes, and it's all because of us 
Oh, and what was in our eyes 
Oh, what was in our eyes, yeah 
I said, Billy Budd 
I would happily lose 
Both of my legs 
I would lose both of my legs 
Oh, if it meant you could be free 
Oh, if it meant you could be free 
(Don't leave us in the dark!)

 

HOLD ON TO YOUR FRIENDS

A bond of trust 
Has been abused 
Something of value 
May be lost 
Give up your job 
Squander your cash - be rash 
Just hold on to your friends 
There are more than enough 
To fight and oppose 
Why waste good time 
Fighting the people you like 
Who will fall defending your name 
Oh, don't feel so ashamed 
To have friends 
But now you only call me 
When you're feeling depressed 
When you feel happy I'm 
So far from your mind 
My patience is stretched 
My loyalty vexed 
Oh, you're losing all of your friends 
Hold on to your friends 
Hold on to your friends 
Resist - or move on 
Be mad, be rash 
Smoke and explode 
Sell all of your clothes 
Just bear in mind : 
Oh, there just might come a time 
When you need some friends

 

THE MORE YOU IGNORE ME, THE CLOSER I GET

The more you ignore me 
The closer I get 
You're wasting your time 
The more you ignore me 
The closer I get 
You're wasting your time 
I will be 
In the bar 
With my head 
On the bar 
I am now 
A central part 
Of your mind's landscape 
Whether you care 
Or do not 
Yeah, I've made up your mind 
The more you ignore me 
The closer I get 
You're wasting your time 
The more you ignore me 
The closer I get 
You're wasting your time 
Beware !
I bear more grudges 
Than lonely high court judges 
When you sleep 
I will creep 
Into your thoughts 
Like a bad debt 
That you can't pay 
Take the easy way 
And give in 
Yeah, and let me in 
Oh, let me in 
Oh let me ... 
Oh, let me in 
IT'S WAR 
IT'S WAR 
WAR 
WAR 
Oh, let me in 
Ah, the closer I get 
Ah, you're asking for it 
Ah, the closer I get 
Ooh, the closer I ...

 

WHY DON'T YOU FIND OUT FOR YOURSELF

The sanest days are mad 
Why don't you find out for yourself ? 
Then you'll see the price 
Very closely 
Some men here 
They have a special interest 
In your career 
They wanna help you to grow 
And then syphon all your dough 
Why don't you find out for yourself ? 
Then you'll see the glass 
Hidden in the grass 
You'll never believe me, so 
Why don't you find out for yourself ? 
Sick down to my heart 
That's just the way it goes 
Some men here 
They know the full extent of 
Your distress 
They kneel and pray 
And they say : 
"Long may it last" 
Why don't you find out for yourself ?
Then you'll see the glass 
Hidden in the grass 
Bad scenes come and go 
For which you must allow 
Sick down to my heart 
That's just the way it goes 
Don't rake up my mistakes 
I know exactly what they are 
And ... what do YOU do ? 
Well ... you just SIT THERE 
I've been stabbed in the back 
So many many times 
I don't have any skin 
But that's just the way it goes

 

I AM HATED FOR LOVING

I am hated for loving 
I am hated for loving 
Anonymous call, a poison pen 
A brick in the small of the back again 
I still don't belong 
To anyone - I am mine 
And I am hated for loving 
I am haunted for wanting 
Anonymous call, a poison pen 
A brick in the ... ah ... 
A brick in the small of the back again 
I still don't belong 
To anyone - I am mine 
I am falling 
With no-one to catch me 
I am falling 
And there's still 
No-one to catch me 
Ah .. 
Anonymous call, a poison pen 
A brick in the ... ah ... 
A brick in the small of the back again 
I just don't belong 
To anywhere 
I just don't belong 
Mmm ... 
Ah ...

 

LIFEGUARD SLEEPING, GIRL DROWNING

Always looking for attention 
Always needs to be mentioned 
Who does she 
Think she should be ? 
The shrill cry through darkening air 
Doesn't she know he's 
Had such a busy day ? 
Tell her ... sshhh
Somebody tell her ... sshhh 
Slowest ... 
It was only a test 
But she swam too far 
Against the tide 
She deserves all she gets 
The sky became marked with stars 
As an out-stretched arm slowly 
Disappears 
Hooray 
Oh hooray 
No, oh, oh, woh, there's no movement 
No, oh, hooray 
Oh, hooray 
Please don't worry 
There'll be no fuss 
She was ... nobody's nothing 
(What's your name ?) 
When he awoke 
The sea was calm 
And another day passes like a dream 
There's no ... no way 
(What's your name ?)

 

USED TO BE A SWEET BOY

Used to be a sweet boy 
Holding so tightly 
To Daddy's hand 
But that was all 
In some distant land 
Blazer and tie 
And a big bright healthy smile 
Used to make all 
Of our trials worthwhile 
Used to be a sweet boy 
And I'm not to blame 
Something went wrong 
And I know 
I'm not to blame 
Something went wrong 
Can't be to blame 
Ah ...

 

THE LAZY SUNBATHERS

A world war 
Was announced 
Days ago 
But they didn't know 
The lazy sunbathers 
The lazy sunbathers 
The sun burns through 
To the planet's core 
And it isn't enough 
They want more 
Nothing 
Appears 
To be 
Between the ears of 
The lazy sunbathers 
Too jaded 
To question stagnation 
The sun burns through 
To the planet's core 
And it isn't enough 
They want more 
Religions fall 
Children shelled 
"...Children shelled ? That's all 
Very well, but would you 
Please keep the noise 
Down low ? 
Because you're waking 
The lazy sunbathers ..."
Oh, the lazy sunbathers 
The lazy sunbathers

 

SPEEDWAY

And when you slam 
Down the hammer 
Can you see it in your heart ? 
All of the rumours 
Keeping me grounded 
I never said, I never said that they were 
Completely unfounded 
So when you slam 
Down the hammer 
Can you see it in your heart ? 
Can you delve so low ? 
And when you're standing 
On my fingers 
Can you see it in your heart ? ... ah ... 
And when you try 
To break my spirit 
It won't work 
Because there's nothing left to break 
Anymore 
All of the rumours 
Keeping me grounded 
I never said, I never said that they were 
Completely unfounded 
You won't sleep 
Until the earth that wants me 
Finally has me 
Oh you've done it now 
You won't rest 
Until the hearse that becomes me 
Finally takes me 
Oh you've done it now 
And you won't smile 
Until my loving mouth 
Is shut good and proper 
FOREVER 
All of the rumours 
Keeping me grounded 
I never said, I never said that they were 
Completely unfounded 
And all those lies 
Written lies, twisted lies 
Well, they weren't lies 
They weren't lies 
They weren't lies 
I never said 
I never said 
I could have mentioned your name 
I could have dragged you in 
Guilt by implication 
By association 
I've always been true to you 
In my own strange way 
I've always been true to you 
In my own sick way 
I'll always stay true to you

 

THE TEACHERS ARE AFRAID OF THE PUPILS

There's too many people 
Planning your downfall 
When your spirit's on trial 
These nights can be frightening 
Sleep transports sadness 
To some other mid-brain 
And somebody here 
Will not be here next year 
So you stand by the board 
Full of fear and intention 
And, if you think that they're listening 
Well, you've got to be joking 
Oh, you understand change 
And you think it's essential 
But when your profession 
Is humiliation 
Say the wrong word to our children ...
We'll have you, oh yes, we'll have you 
Lay a hand on our children 
And it's never too late to have you 
Mucus on your collar 
A nail up through the staff chair 
A blade in your soap 
And you cry into your pillow 
To be finished would be a relief 
To be finished would be a relief... 
Say the wrong word to our children ...
We'll have you, oh yes, we'll have you 
Lay a hand on our children 
And it's never too late to have you 
To be finished would be a relief 
To be finished would be a relief...
I'm very glad this thing has come 
Sometimes I'm so glad 
Never bother to play the tunes 
I've seen it coming for dear life

 

READER MEET AUTHOR

You don't know a thing about their lives 
They live where you wouldn't dare to drive
You shake as you think of how they sleep 
But you write as if you are my side-by-side 
Reader, meet Author 
With the hope of hearing sense 
But you may be feeling let down 
By the words of defence 
He says : "No-one ever sees me when I cry"
You don't know a thing about their lives 
Books don't save them, books aren't Stanley knives 
And if a fight broke out here tonight 
You'd be the first away, because you're that type 
And the Year 2000 won't change anyone here 
As each fabled promise flies so fast 
You'll swear it was never there 
Oh, have you ever escaped from a shipwrecked life ? 
So safely with your software; all miles from the front line 
You hear the way their sad voices, and you start to imagine things 
Oh, any excuse to write more lies

He's just too good-natured and

THE OPERATION

You fight with your right hand 
And caress with your left hand 
Everyone I know is sick to death of you 
With a tear that's a mile wide 
In the kite that you're flying 
Everyone I know is sick to death of you 
Ever since 
You don't look the same 
You're just not the same, no way 
You say clever things and 
You never used to 
You don't catch what I'm saying 
When you're deafened to advice 
Everyone here is sick to the 
Back teeth of you 
With a tear that's a mile wide 
In the kite that you're flying 
Everyone here is sick to the 
Tattoo of you 
Ever since 
You don't look the same 
You're just not the same, no way 
You say pleasant things and 
There is no need to
Still, you fight with your right hand 
And caress with your left hand 
Ooh, ooh ... Sad to say ... 
How once I was in love with you 
Sad to say ... 
You don't catch what I'm saying 
When you're deafened to advice 
Ooh, ooh ... Ever since 
You don't look the same 
You're just not the same, no way 
What the hell have 
They stuck into you ?

 

DAGENHAM DAVE

Head in the clouds, and a mouthful of pie 
Head in a blouse, everybody loves him 
I see why 
Dagenham Dave, Dagenham Dave, Oh, Dagenham Dave 
Dagenham Dave, Dagenham Dave, Oh, Dagenham Dave 
"I love Karen, I love Sharon" on the windowscreen 
With never the need to fight or to question a single thing 
Dagenham Dave, Dagenham Dave Oh, Dagenham Dave 
Dagenham Dave, Dagenham Dave Oh, Dagenham Dave ...
He'd love to touch, he's afraid that he might self-combust 
I could say more, but you get the general idea 
Dagenham Dave, Dagenham Dave Dagenham Dave, Dagenham Dave 
Dagenham, Dagenham Dagenham Dave, Dagenham Dave ...
Oh, Dave, oh, Dagenham, dagenham, Oh, Dave, oh, Dave, ...

 

DO YOUR BEST AND DON'T WORRY

Compare the best of their days 
With the worst of your days 
You won't win 
With your standards so high 
And your spirits so low 
At least remember ... 
This is you on a bad day, you on a pale day 
Just do your best and don't ... Don't worry, oh 
The way you hang yourself is oh, so unfair 
See the best of how they look 
Against the worst of how you are
And again, you won't win 
With your standards so high 
And your spirits so low 
At least remember ... 
This is you on a drab day, you in a drab dress 
Just do your best and don't ... Don't worry, oh 
The way you hang yourself is oh, so unfair 
Just do your best and don't ... Don't worry, oh 
The way you watch yourself is oh, so unfair 
Just do your best and don't ... Don't worry, oh 
Do your best and don't ...

SOUTHPAW

You were a boy before you became a man 
I don't see the joy 
And you ran with your pals in the sun 
You turned around and they were gone 
Again ... 
A sick boy should be treated 
So easily defeated 
Oh, I just don't understand 
So you ran with your pals in the sun 
You turned around 
You were alone 
Again ... 
And you ran back to Ma 
Which set the pace for the rest of your days 
Oh, you ran back to Ma 
Which set the pace for the rest of your days 
Oh, you ran back to Ma 
Which set the pace for the rest of your days 
And now, there is something that you should know 
There is something that you should know 
The girl of your dreams is 
Here all alone 
Girl of your dreams is 
Here all alone 
The girl of your dreams is 
Sad and all alone 
The girl of your dreams is 
Here all alone 
There is something that you should know

Girl of your dreams is 
Here all alone 
The girl of your dreams is 
Sad and is all alone 
The girl of your dreams is 
Sad and is feeling all alone 
Oh, there is something that you should know 
Help me, help me, help me ...

 

MALADJUSTED

I wanna start from 
Before the beginning 
Loot wine, "Be mine, and 
Then let's stay out for the night"
Ride via Parkside 
Semi-perilous lives 
Jeer the lights in the windows 
Of all safe and stable homes 
(But wondering then, well what 
Could peace of mind be like ?)
Anyway do you want to hear 
Our story, or not ? 
As the Fulham Road lights 
Stretch and invite into the night 
From a Stevenage overspill 
We'd kill to live around 
SW6 - with someone like you 
Keep thieves' hours 
With someone like you 
...As long as it slides 
You stalk the house 
In a low-cut blouse : 
"Oh Christ, another stifled 
Friday night !"
And the Fulham Road lights 
Stretch and invite into the night 
Well, I was fifteen 
What could I know ?
When the gulf between 
All the things I need 
And the things I receive 
Is an ancient ocean 
Wide, wild, lost, uncrossed 
Still I maintain there's nothing 
Wrong with you 
You do all that you do 
Because it's all you can do 
Well, I was fifteen 
Where could I go ?
With a soul full of loathing 
For stinging bureaucracy 
Making it anything 
Other than easy 
For working girls like me 
With my hands on my head 
I flop on your bed 
With a head full of dread 
For all I've ever said 
Maladjusted, maladjusted 
Maladjusted maladjusted 
Never to be trusted 
Oh, never to be trusted 
There's nothing wrong with you, oh 
...There's nothing wrong with you

 

ALMA MATTERS

So : the choice I have made 
May seem strange to you 
But who asked you, anyway ? 
It's my life to wreck 
My own way 
You see : to someone, somewhere, oh yeah ... 
Alma matters 
In mind, body and soul 
In part, and in whole 
Because to someone, somewhere, oh yeah ... 
Alma matters 
In mind, body and soul 
In part, and in whole 
So the life I have made 
May seem wrong to you 
But, I've never been surer 
It's my life to ruin 
My own way 
You see : to someone, somewhere, oh yeah ... 
Alma matters 
In mind, body and soul 
In part, and in whole 
Because to someone, somewhere, oh yeah ... 
Alma matters 
In mind, body and soul 
In part, and in whole 
To someone, somewhere, oh yeah ... 
Alma matters 
In mind, body and soul 
Part, and in whole 
So to someone, somewhere, oh yeah ... 
Alma matters 
In mind, body and soul 
Part, and in whole 
To someone, somewhere, oh yeah ... 
Oh yeah ... Oh yeah, oh yeah Oh yeah ...

 

AMBITIOUS OUTSIDERS

Bolt-lock your doors 
Alarm your cars 
And still we move in closer 
Every day 
Top of the list 
Is your smiling kids 
But we'll be smiling too 
So that's OK 
Oh, and by the way 
Thank you, because you're 
Giving, giving, giving 
And we're receiving - 
No, no, we're taking 
Keeping the population down 
Your taxes paid, but 
Police waylaid 
And we knows 
When the school bus 
Comes and goes 
We're on your street, but 
You don't see us 
Or, if you do 
You smile and say Hello 
BUT DON'T UNDERESTIMATE US 
When you are 
Giving, giving, giving 
And we're receiving - 
No, no, we're taking 
Just keeping 
The population down 
You're giving, giving, giving 
Well, it's your own fault 
For reproducing 
We're just keeping 
The population down

 

TROUBLE LOVES ME

Trouble loves me 
Trouble needs me 
Two things 
More than you do 
Or would attempt to 
So, console me 
Otherwise, hold me 
Just when it seems like 
Everything's evened out 
And the balance 
Seems serene 
Trouble loves me 
Walks beside me 
To chide me 
Not to guide me 
It's still much more 
Than you'll do 
So, console me 
Otherwise, hold me 
Just when it seems like 
Everything's evened out 
And the balance seems serene 
See the fool I'll be 
Still running 'round 
On the flesh rampage 
Still running 'round 
Ready with ready-wit 
Still running 'round 
On the flesh rampage 
- At your age ! 
Go to Soho, oh 
Go to waste in 
The wrong arms 
Still running 'round 
Trouble loves me 
Seeks and finds me 
To charlatanize me 
Which is only 
As it should be 
Oh, please fulfill me 
Otherwise, kill me 
Show me a barrel and watch me scrape it 
Faced with the music, as always I'll face it 
In the half-light 
So English, frowning 
Then at midnight I 
Can't get you out of my head 
A disenchanted taste 
Still running 'round 
A disenchanted taste 
Still running 'round

 

PAPA JACK

Papa Jack 
Wants to turn 
Back the clock 
And reach out 
To the kids 
He once had 
Who have flown 
Papa Jack 
In decline 
Feels inclined 
To reach out 
To the kids 
He once had 
Who have flown 
But there was a time 
When the kids reached up 
And Papa Jack just 
Pushed them away 
Looking deep 
In his heart 
Papa Jack 
Doesn't like 
What he sees 
Or the time 
On his hands 
The dying day 
The chilly sun 
Papa Jack 
All alone 
Sings slow 
Grieving and low 
But there was a time 
When the kids reached up 
Now you can't always 
Have it your way 
Papa Jack 
Ah ...

 

AMMUNITION

I know these roads 
Each ridge 
And narrow bridge 
Each cheveron 
Enticing me on 
Each warning sign 
I take in my stride 
I don't need more ammunition 
I've got more than I can spend 
I don't dwell on things I'm missing 
I'm just pleased 
With the things I've found 
I know these roads 
An old hand understands 
Above all, I know what's 
Expected of me now 
Veering cliffwards 
I don't need more ammunition 
I've got more than I can spend 
I don't dwell on things I'm missing 
I'm just pleased 
With the things I've found 
With the things I've found 
With the things I've found 
I've found 
I've been crying 
It comes back on these salient days 
And it stays 
And it says : 
"We've never really been away" 
I don't need more ammunition 
I've got more than I can spend 
I don't think of who I'm missing 
I've got no space and no time 
In my life, anymore 
No space or time 
In my life, anymore 
For Revenge

 

WIDE TO RECEIVE

Download something 
Useful, or useless 
Because I'm lying here 
Wide to receive 
Almost anything 
You'd care to give 
And I don't 
Get along with myself 
And I'm not too keen 
On anyone else 
Turn on, plug in 
Then just walk away 
Unlock, process 
And then just go 
And I've never felt quite so alone 
As I do right now 
I'm lying here 
Wide to receive 
Almost anything 
You'd care to leave 
Wide, wide, wide Wide, wide, wide...

 

ROY'S KEEN

(GO ON !)
He's romancing you 
And chancing his arm 
He'll be here 
Smiling on time 
He's romancing you 
And chancing his arm 
He'll be here 
Smiling on time 
Roy's keen oh Roy's keen 
Roy's keen oh Roy's keen 
We've never seen a 
Keener window-cleaner 
Back up the ladder 
Into each corner 
Dunking the chamois 
Just think of the goodwill 
The ladder's a planet 
Roy is a star, and 
I am a satellite 
(But that's alright) 
He can hold a smile for as long 
As you require (even longer) 
He can hold a smile for as long 
As you require (even longer) 
Roy's keen oh Roy's keen 
Roy's keen oh Roy's keen 
We've never seen a 
Keener window-cleaner 
Back up the ladder 
Into each corner 
Dunking the chamois 
Just think of the goodwill 
The ladder's a planet 
Roy is a star, and 
I am a satellite 
I will be set alight 
Don't say you'll hold it steady 
Then you let it go 
Don't say you'll hold it steady 
Then you let it go Oh ...
You're up the ladder 
Into each corner 
Foot in a bucket 
We trust you to wreck it 
Even when it's under your nose 
Well, you just can't 
See it, can you ? 
Well, it's here 
Right under your nose 
And you just can't 
See it, can you? La la la la ...
Roy's keen, Roy's keen La la la la ...
We've never seen a 
Keener window-cleaner 
Oh ... La la la la ...

 

HE CRIED

I need you 
Simple words 
But words which had never been heard 
By the soul 
Stoned to death 
But still living 
And so he froze where he stood 
And he looked to the ground 
And he cried 
He cried 
Ride our minds 
If you must 
But there's always a line you don't cross 
Time is short 
Don't be cruel 
Oh you don't know the power 
In what you're saying 
Oh ... 
And so he froze where he stood 
And he looked to the ground 
And he cried 
He cried 
People where 
I come from 
They survive without feelings or blood 
I never could 
Was stoned to death 
But I'm still living 
So he froze where he stood 
And he looked to the ground 
And he cried 
He cried 
So he froze 
And he looked, and he looked 
To the ground 
And he cried 
He cried

 

SORROW WILL COME IN THE END

Legalized theft 
Leaves me bereft 
I get it straight in the neck 
(Somehow expecting no less) 
A court of justice 
With no use for Truth 
Lawyer ...liar 
Lawyer ...liar 
You pleaded and squealed 
And you think you've won 
But Sorrow will come 
To you in the end 
And as sure as my words are pure 
I praise the day that brings you pain 
Q.C.'s obsessed with sleaze 
Frantic for Fame 
They're all on the game 
They just use a different name 
You lied 
And you were believed 
By a J.P. senile and vile 
You pleaded and squealed 
And you think you've won 
But Sorrow will come 
To you in the end 
And as sure as my words are pure 
I praise the day that brings you pain 
So don't close your eyes 
Don't close your eyes 
A man who slits throats 
Has time on his hands 
And I'm gonna get you 
So don't close your eyes 
Don't ever close your eyes 
You think you've won 
OH NO

 

SATAN REJECTED MY SOUL

Satan rejected my soul 
He knows my kind 
He won't be dragged down 
He's seen my face around 
He knows Heaven doesn't seem 
To be my home 
So I must find 
Somewhere else to go 
So I must find 
Somewhere else to go 
So, take it - please 
It's free 
You'll never see 
You'll never see 
All the fun in life it's cost me 
Satan rejected my soul 
As low as he goes 
He never quite goes this low 
He's seen my face around 
He knows Heaven doesn't seem 
To be my home 
So I must find 
Somewhere else to go 
So I must find 
Somewhere else to go 
So, take it please 
It's really sly 
Come on, come on, ah Come on, come on, come on 
Take it please, It's really sly 
Come on, come on, ah Come on, come on, come on 
Call me in, Pull me in, call me in 
Come on, come on, oh Come on, come on, come on 
Pull me in, pull me in, Call me in, haul me in, pull me in 
Come on, come on, ah, Come on, come on 
La la la la la, Oh ...

 
 REEL AROUND THE FOUNTAIN

It's time the tale was told
of how you took a child
and you made him old
Reel around the fountain
slap me on the patio
I'll take it now
Fifteen minutes with you
well, I wouldn't say no
people said that you were virtually dead
and they were so wrong
fifteen minutes with you
well, i wouldn't say no
people said that you were easily led
and they were half-right
I dreamt about you last night
and i fell out of bed twice
you can pin and mount me like a butterfly
but take me to the haven of your bed
was something that you never said
two lumps, please
you're the bee's knees
but so am I
Meet me at the fountain
shove me on the patio
I'll take it slowly
Fifteen minutes with you
oh I wouldn't say no
people see no worth in you
oh but I do

 

YOU'VE GOT EVERYTHING NOW

As merry as the days were long
I was right and you were wrong
back at the old grey school
I would win and you would lose
But you've got everything now
and what a terrible mess I've made of my life
No, I've never had a job
because I've never wanted one
I've seen you smile
but I've never really heard you laugh
So who is rich and who is poor?
I cannot say...
You are your mother's only son
and you're a desperate one
But I don't want a lover
I just want to be seen in the back of your car
A friendship sadly lost?
Well, this is true ...and yet, it's false
Did I ever tell you , by the way
I never did like your face
But you've got everything now
and what a terrible mess I've made of my life
No, I've never had a job
because I'm too shy
But I don't want a lover
I just want to be tied to the back of your car.

 

MISERABLE LIE

So, goodbye
please stay with your own kind
and I'll stay with mine
There's something against us
it's not time
So, goodbye
I know I hardly say
how much I love your casual way
but please put your tongue away
a little higher and we're well away
the dark nights are drawing in
and your humour is as black as them
I look at yours, you laugh at mine
and"love" is just a miserable lie
you have destroyed my flower like-life
not once-but twice
you have corrupt my innocent mind
not once-but twice
I know that wind-swept mystical air
it means: I'd like to see your underwear
I recognise that mystical air
it means: I'd like to see your underwear
what do we get for the trouble and pain?
just a rented room in Whalley Range
into the depths of the criminal world
I followed her...
I need advice, I need advice
because nobody ever looks at me twice
I'm just a country-mile behind
the world
I'm just a country mile behind
the whole world
so take me when you go

 

PRETTY GIRLS MAKE GRAVES

Upon the sand,upon the bay
"there is a quick and easy way" you say
before you illustrate
I'd rather state:
"I'm not the man you think I am
I'm not the man you think I am "
And Sorrow's native son
he will not smile for anyone
And pretty girls makes the graves
End of the pier, end of the bay
you tug my arm and say:"Give into lust,
give up to lust, oh heaven knows we'll
soon be dust..."
But I'm not the man you think I am
I'm not the man you think I am
And Sorrow's native son
he will not rise for anyone
And pretty girls make graves
I could have been wild and I could have been free
but Nature played this trick on me
She wants it Now
and she will not wait
but she's too rough
and I'm too delicate
Then on the sand
another man, he takes her hand
and a smile lights up her stupid face
(and well, it would)
I lost my faith in Womanhood
I lost my faith in Womanhood, I lost my faith

 

THE HAND THAT ROCKS THE CRADLE

Please don't cry
the ghost and the storm outside
will not invade this sacred shire
nor infiltrate your mind
my life down I shall lie
if the bogey-man should try
to play tricks on your sacred mind
to tease, torment and tantalise
wavering shadows loom
a piano plays in an empty room
there'll be blood on the cleaver tonight
when darkness lifts and the room is bright
I'll still be by your side
for you are all that matters
and I'll love you till the day I die
there never need to be longing in your eyes
as long as the hand that rocks the cradle is mine
ceiling shadows shimmy by
and when the wardrobe towers like a beast of prey
there's a sadness in your beautiful eyes
you're untouched, unsoiled, wonderous eyes
my life down I shall lie
should restless spirts try
to play tricks on you sacred mind
but whom I never gave a name
I just looked into his wonderous eyes
and said" never never never again"
all too soon I did return
just like a moth to a flame
so rattle my bones all over the stones
because I'm only a beggar-man whom nobody owns
see how words as old as sin
fit me like a glove I'm here and here I'll stay
together we lie, together we pray
there never need be longing in your eyes
as long as the hand that rocks the cradle is mine

 

STILL ILL

I decree today that life
is simply taking and not giving
England is mine and it owes me a living
ask me why, and I'll spit in your eye
ask me why, and I'll spit in your eye
but we cannot cling to the old dreams anymore
no, we cannot cling to the old dreams anymore
Does the body rule the mind
or does the mind rule the body?
I dunno...
Under the iron bridge we kissed
and although I ended up with sore lips
it just wasn't like the old days anymore
no, it wasn't like those days
am I still ill?
Does the body rule the mind
or does the mind rule the body ?
I dunno...
Ask me why, and I'll die
ask me why, and I'll die
and if you must go to work tomorrow
well, if I were you I wouldn't bother
for there are brighter sides to life
and I should know because I've seen them
but not very often...
under the iron bridge we kissed
and although I ended up with sore lips
it just wasn't like the old days anymore
no, it wasn't like those days
am I still ill?

 

HAND IN GLOVE

Hand in glove
the sun shines out of our behinds
no, it's not like any other love
this one is different-because it's us
Hand in glove
we can go wherever we please
and everything depends upon
how near you stand to me
And if the people stare
then the people stare
I really don't know and I really don't care
Hand in glove
the Good People laugh
yes, we may be hidden by rags
but we have something they'll never have
So, hand in glove I stake my claim
I'll fight to the last breath
If they dare touch a hair on your head
I'll fight to the last breath
The Good Life is out there, somewhere
so stay on my arm, you little charmer
But I know my luck too well
and I'll probably never see you again.

 

WHAT DIFFERENCE DOES IT MAKE?

All men have secrets and here is mine
so let it be known
we have been through hell and high tide,
I can surely rely on you?
and yet you start to recoil,
heavy words are so lightly thrown
but still I'd leap in front of a flying bullet for you
So, what difference does it make?
so, what difference does it make?
it makes none
but you have gone
and you must be looking very old tonight
The devil will find work for idle hands to do
I stole and I lied, and why?
because you asked me to!
but now you make feel so ashamed
because I've only got two hands
well, I'm still fond of you
So, what difference does it make?
so, what difference does it make?
it makes none
but you have gone
and your prejudice won't keep you warm tonight
So, no more apologies
no more apologies
I'm too tired
I'm too sick and tired
and I'm feeling very sick and ill today
But I'm still fond of you

 

I DON'T OWE YOU ANYTHING

Bought on stolen wine
a nod was the first step
you know very well
what was coming next
did I really walk all this way
just to hear you say
"oh I don't want to go out tonight"
but you will
for you must
I don't owe you anything
but you owe me something
repay me now
you should never go to them
let them come to you
just like I do
you should not go to them
let them come to you
just like I do
Too freely on your lips
words prematurely said
oh but I know what will make you smile tonight
Life is never kind
life is never kind
oh but I know what will make you smile tonight

 

SUFFER LITTLE CHILDREN

Over the moors,take me to the moors
dig a shallow grave
and I'll lay me down
Lesley-Anne, with your pretty white beads
oh John, you'll never be a man
and you'll never see your home again
oh Manchester, so much to answer for
Edward, see those alluring lights?
tonight will be your very last night
a woman said "I know my son is dead
I'll never rest my hands on his scared head"
Hindley wakes and Hindley says:
"Wherever he has gone, I have gone "
But fresh lilaced moorland fields
cannot hide the stoild stench of death
Hindley wakes and Hindley says:
"Whatever he has done, I have done"
But this is no easy ride
for a child cries
"find me...find me, nothing more
we're on a sullen misty moor
we may be dead and we may be gone
but we will be right by your side
until the day you die
this is no easy ride
we will haunt you when you laugh
yes, you could say we're a team
you might sleep
BUT YOU WILL NEVER DREAM!"
Oh Manchester, so much to answer for
Oh Manchester, so much to answer for
Over the moor, I'm on the moor
the child is on the moor

 

THE HEADMASTER RITUAL

Belligerent ghouls
run Manchester schools
spineless swines
cemented mines
Sir leads the troops
jealous of youth
same old suit since 1962
he does the military two-step
down the nape of my neck
I wanna go home
I don't want to stay
give up education
is a bad mistake
mid-week on the playing fields
Sir thwacks you on the knees
knees you in the groin
elbow in the face
I wanna go home
I don't want to stay
Belligerent ghouls
run Manchester schools
spineless bastards all
Sir leads the troops
jealous of youth
same old jokes since 1902
he does the military two-step
down the nape of my neck
I wanna go home
I don't want to stay
give up life
as a bad mistake
please excuse me from gym
I've got this terrible cold coming on
he grabs and devours
he kicks me in the showers
kicks me in the showers
and he grabs and devours
I wanna go home
I don't want to stay

 

RUSHOLME RUFFIANS

The last night at the fair
by the big wheel generator
a boy is stabbed
and his money is grabbed
and the air hangs heavy like a dulling wine
she is famous
she is funny
an engagement ring
doesn't mean a thing
to a mind consumed by brass(money)
and though I walk home alone
my faith in love is still devout
the last night at the fair
from a seat on a whirling waltzer
her skirt ascends for a watching eye
it's a hideous trait( on her mother's side)
and though I walk home alone
my faith in love is still devout
then someone falls in love
and someone's beaten up
and the senses being dulled are mine
and someone falls in love
someone's beaten up
and the senses being dulled are mine
and though I walk home alone
my faith in love is still devout
this is the last night of the fair
and the grease in the hair
of a speedway operator
is all a tremulous heart requires
a schoolgirl is denied
she said "How quickly would I die
if I jumped from the top of the parachutes?"
this is the last night of the fair

scratch my name on your arm with a fountain pen

I WANT THE ONE I CAN'T HAVE

On the day that your mentality
catches up with your biology
I want the one I can't have
and it's driving me mad
it's written all over my face
A double-bed
and a stalwart lover, for sure
these are the riches of the poor
A double-bed
and a stalwart lover, for sure
these are the riches of the poor
a tough kid who sometimes swallows nails
raised on Prisoner's Aid
he killed a policeman when he was thirteen
and somehow that really impressed me
it's written all over my face
On the day that your mentality
catches up with your biology
And if you ever need self-validation
just meet me in the alley by the
railway-station
it's written all over my face

 

WHAT SHE SAID

What she said:
"How come someone hasn't noticed
that I'm dead
and decided to bury me
God knows, I'm ready"
What she said was
but then, all the rejection she's had
to pretend to be happy
could only be idiocy
What she said was not for the job or
lover that she never had
What she read
all heady books
she'd sit and prophesise
(it took a tattoed boy from Birkenhead
to really really open her eyes)

THAT JOKE ISN'T FUNNY ANYMORE

Park the car at the side of the road
you should know
time's tide will smother you
and I will too
when you laugh about other people who feel so
very lonely
their only desire is to die
well I'm afraid
it doesn't make me smile
I wish I could laugh
but that joke isn't funny anymore
it's too close to home and it's too near the bone
it's too close to home and it's too near the bone
more than you'll ever know
It was dark as I drove the point home
and on cold leather seats
well, it suddenly struck me
I just might die with a smile on my
face after all
I've seen this happen in other people's lives
and now it's happening in mine

 

NOWHERE FAST

I'd like to drop my trousers to the world
I am a man of means(of slender means)
each household appliance
is like a new science in my town
and if a day came when I felt a natural emotion
I'd get such a shock I'd probably jump in the ocean
and when a train goes by
it's such a sad sound
I'd like to drop my trousers to the Queen
every sensible child will know what this means
the poor and the needy
are selfish and greedy on her terms
and if the day came when I felt a natural emotion
I'd get such a shock I'd probably jump in the ocean
and when a train goes by
it's such a sad song
And when I'm lying in my bed
I think about life
and I think about death
and neither one particularly appeals to me
and if the day came when I felt a natural emotion
I'd get such a shock I'd probably lie
in the middle of the street and die
I'd lie down and die

 

WELL I WONDER

Well I wonder
do you hear me when you sleep?
I hoarsely cry
Well I wonder
do you see me when we pass?
I half-die
Please keep me in mind
please keep me in mind
Gasping-but somehow still alive
this is the fierce last stand of all I am
Gasping-dying-but somehow still alive
this is the final stand of all I am
Please keep me in mind

 

BARBARISM BEGINS AT HOME

Unruly boys
who will not grow up
must be taken in hand
Unruly girls
who will not settle down
they must be taken in hand
A crack on the head
is what you get for not asking
and a crack on the head
is what you get for asking

 

MEAT IS MURDER

Heifer whines could be human cries
closer comes the screaming knife
this beautiful creature must die
this beautiful creature must die
a death for no reason
and death for reason is MURDER
and the flesh you so fancifully fry
is not succulent, tasty or nice
it's death for no reason
and death for no reason is MURDER
and the calf that you carve with a smile
is MURDER
and the turkey you festively slice
is MURDER
do you know how animals die?
kitchen aroma aren't very homely
it's not "comforting," "cheery" or kind
it's sizzling blood and the unholy stench
of MURDER
it's not "natural," "normal" or kind
the fleas you so fancifully fry
as you savour the flavour
of MURDER
NO, NO, NO, IT'S MURDER
NO, NO, NO, IT'S MURDER
who hears when animals cry?

 

THE QUEEN IS DEAD

Farewell to this lands cheerless marches
hemmed in like a boar between arches
her very Lowness with her head in a sling
Im truely sorry-but it sounds like a wonderful thing
dear Charles, dont you ever crave
to appear on the front of the Daily mail
dressed in your Mother's bridal veil?
So, I checked all the registered historical facts
and I was shocked into shame to discover
how Im the 18th pale descendent
of some, old queen or other
has the world changed, or have I changed?
has the world changed, or have I changed?
as some 9-year old tough peddles drugs
(I never even knew what drugs were)
And so, I broke into the Palace
with a sponge and a rusty spanner
she said: "Eh, I know you, and you cannot sing"
I said: "that's nothing -you should hear me play piano"
We can go for a walk where it's quiet and dry
and we can talk about precious things
but when you are tied to your mother's apron
not one talks about castration
We can go for a walk where it's quiet and dry
and we can talk about precious things
like love and law and poverty
these are the things that kill me
We can go for a walk where it's quiet and dry
and we can talk about precious things
but the rain that flattens my hair
theses are the things that kill me
Passed the Pub that saps your body
and the church who'll snatch your money
the Queen is dead, boys
and it's so lonely on a limb
Pass the Pub that wrecks your body
and the church-all they want is your money
the Queen is dead, boys`
you can trust me, boys
life is very long, when you're lonely
life is very long, when you're lonely...

 

FRANKLY MR.SHANKLY

Frankly, Mr Shankly, this position Ive held
it pays my way, but it corrodes my soul
I want to leave you will not miss me
I want to go down in musical history
Frankly, Mr Shankly, Im a sickening wreck
Ive got the 21st Century breathing down my neck
I must move fast, you understand me
I want to go down in celluloid history
Fame, Fame, fatal Fame
it can play hideous tricks on the brain
but still I rather be Famous
than righteous or holy, any day
but sometimes Id feel more fulfilled
making Christmas cards with the mentally ill
I want to Live and I want to Love
I want to catch something that I might be ashamed of
Frankly, Mr Shankly, this position I've held
it pays my way and it corrodes my soul
oh, I didnt realise that you wrote poetry
(I didnt realise you wrote such bloody awful poetry)
Frankly, Mr Shankly, since you ask
you are a flatulent pain the arse
I do not mean to be so rude
but still, I must speck frankly, Mr Shankly

 

I KNOW IT'S ALL OVER

Oh Mother, I can fell the soil falling over my head
and as i climb into an empty bed
Oh well, Enough said
I know it's over-still I cling
I don't know where else I can go
Oh Mother, I can feel the soil falling over my head
see, the sea want s to take me
the knife wants to cut me
do you think you can help me?
Sad veiled bride, please be happy
handsome groom, give her room
loud, loutish lover, treat her kindly
(although she needs you
more than she loves you)
and I know it's over
and it never really began
but in my heart it was so real
and you even spoke to me and said:
"If you're so funny
then why are you on your own tonight?
and if you are so clever
then why are you on your own tonight?
if you're so terribly good looking
then why do you sleep alone tonight?
because tonight is just like any other night
that's why you're on your own tonight
with your triumphs and your charms
while they are in each other's arms.."
It's so easy to laugh
it's so easy to hate
it takes strength to be gentle and kind
It's so easy to laugh
it's so easy to hate
it takes guts to be gentle and kind
love is Natural and Real
but not for you, my love
not tonight my love
love is Natural and Real
but not for such as you and I, my love
Oh Mother, I can fell the soil falling over my head
Oh Mother, I can fell the soil falling over my head...

 

NEVER HAD NO ONE EVER

When you walk without ease
on these
the very streets where you were raised
I had a really bad dream
it lasted 20 years, 7 months, and 27 days
Never had no one ever.

 

CEMETERY GATES

A dreaded sunny day
so I meet you at the cemetry gates
Keats and Yeats are on your side
A dreaded sunny day
so I meet you at the cemetry gates
Keats and Yeats are on your side
while Wilde is on mine
So we go inside and we gravely read the stones
all those people all those lives
where are they now ?
with loves, and hates
and passions just like mine
they were born
and then they lived and then they died
which seems so unfair
and I wantr to crv
You say: "ere thrice the sun hath done salutation to the dawn"
and you claim these words as your own
but Im well-read, have heard them said
a hundred times (maybe less, maybe more)
if you must write prose/poems
the words you use should be your own
dont plagiarise or take "on loans"
there's alweays someone, somewhere
with a big nose, who knows
and who trips you up and laughs
when you fall
You say: "ere long done do does did "
words which could only be your own
you then produce the text
from whence was ripped
(some dizzy whore, 1804)
A dreaded sunny day
so let's go where we're happy
so I meet you at the cemetry gates
Keats and Yeats are on your side
A dreaded sunny day
so let's go where we're wanted
so I meet you at the cemetry gates
Keats and Yeats are on your side
but you lose
because Wilde is on mine

 

BIGMOUTH STRIKES AGAIN

Sweetness, sweetness I was only joking
when I said Id like to smash every tooth
in your head
Sweetness, sweetness I was only joking
when I said by right s you should be
bludgeoned in your bed
and now I know how Joan of Arc felt
now I know how Joan of Arc felt
as the flames roseto her roman nose
and her Walkman stared to melt
Bibmouth, bigmouth
bigmouth strikes again
and Ive got no right to take my place
with the Human race
and now I know how Joan of Arc felt
now I know of Joan of Arc felt
as the flames rose to her roman nose
and her hearing aid started to melt
Bigmouth, bigmouth
bigmouth strikes again
and Ive got no right to take my place
with the Human race

 

THE BOY WITH A THORN IN HIS SIDE

The boy with the thorn in his side
behind the hatred there lies
a murderous desire for love
how can they look into my eyes
and still they dont believe me
how can they hear me say those words
and still they dont believe me
and if they don't believe me now
will they ever believe me?
and if they don't believe me now
will they ever believe me?
The boy with the thorn in his side
behind the hatred there lies
a plundering desire for love
how can they see the Love in our eyes
and still they don't believe us
and after all this time
they don't want to believe us
and if they dont believe us now
will they ever believe us ?
andd when you want to Live
how do you start ?
where do you go ?
who do you know?

 

VICAR IN A TUTU

I was minding mind business
lifting some lead off
the roof of the Holy Name church
it was worthwhile living a laughable life
just to set my eyes on a blistering sight
of a vicar in a tu-tu
he's not strange
he just wants to live his life this way
a scanty bit of a thing
with a decorative ring
that wouldn't cover the head of a child
as Rose collects the money in the cannister
who comes sliding down the bannister
the vicar in a tu-tu
he's not strange
he just wants to live his life this way
the monkish monsignor
with a head full of plaster
said "my man, get your vile soul dry-cleaned"
as Rose counts the money in the cannister
as natural as rain
he dances again
vicar in a tu-tu
The next day in the pulpit
with Freedom and Ease
combating ignoranca,dust and disease
as Rose counts the money in the cannister
as natural as rain
he dances again
the fabric of a tu-tu
any man could get us to
and I am a living sign.

 

THERE IS A LIGHT THAT NEVER GOES OUT

Take me out tonight
where there's music and there's people
who are young and alive
driving in your car
I never never want to go home
because I havent got one
anymore
take me out tonight
because I want to see people and I
want to see lights
driving in your car
oh please dont drop me home
because it's not my home, it's their
home, and Im welcome no morw
and if a double-decker bus
crashes in to us
to die by your side
such a heavenly way to die
and if a ten ton truck
kills the both of us
to die by your side
the pleasure and the privilege is mine
take me out tonight
oh take me anywhere, I dont care
and in the darken underpass
I thought Oh God, my chance has come at last
(but then a strange fear gripped me and I just couldn't ask)
take me out tonight
take me anywhere, I dont care
just driving in your car
I never never want to go home
because I havent got one
I havent got one.

 

SOME GIRLS ARE BIGGER THAN OTHERS

From the ice-age to the dole-age
there is but one concern
and I have just discover
some girls are bigger than others
some girls are bigger than others
some girls mothers are bigger than
other girls mothers
As Anthony said to Cleopatra
as he opened a crate of ale:
some girls are bigger than others
some girls are bigger than others
some girls mothers are bigger than
other girls mothers.

 

A RUSH AND A PUSH AND AND THE LAND IS OURS

HELLO
I am the ghost of Troubled Joe
hung by his pretty white neck
some eighteen months ago
I travelled to a mystical time zone
but I missed my bed
so I soon came home
they said:
"there's too much caffeine
in your bloodstream
and a lack of real spice
in your life"
I said:
"leave me alone
because I'm alright, dad
just surprised to still
be on my own...."
Ooh, but don't mention love
I'd hate the real strain of the pain again
a rush and a push and the land that
we stand on is ours
it has been before
so it shall be again
and people who are uglier than you and I
they take what they need, and leave
Ooh, but don't mention love
I'd hate the pain and the strain all over again
a rush and a push and the land that
we stand on is ours
it has been before
so why can't it be now?
and people who are weaker than you and I
they take what they want from life
Ooh, but don't mention love
no - just don't mention love!
a rush and a push and the land that
we stand on is ours
your youth may be gone
but you're still a young man
so phone me, phone me, phone me
so phone me, phone me, phone me
Ooh, I think I'm in love...
Urrgh, I think I'm in lerv

 

I STARTED SOMETHING I COULDN'T FINISH

The lanes were silent
with nothing or no one around for miles
I doused our friendly venture
with a hard-faced
three-word gesture
I started something
I forced you into a zone
and you were clearly
never meant to go
hair brushed and parted
typical me, typical me, typical me
I started something
...and now I'm not too sure
I grabbed you by the guilded beams
that's what Tradition means
and I doused another venture
with a gesture
that was...absolutely vile
I started something
forced you to a zone
and you were clearly
never meant to go
hair brushed and parted
typical me, typical me, typical me
I started something
...and now I'm not too sure
I grabbed you by the guilded beams
that's what Tradition means
and now eighteen months' hard-labour
seems...fair enough
I started something
forced you to a zone
and you were clearly
never meant to go
hair brushed and parted
typical me, typical me, typical me
I started something
and now I'm not too sure

 

DEATH OF A DISCO DANCER

The death of a disco dancer
well, it happens a lot 'round here
and if you think Peace
is a common goal
well, that goes to show
just how little you know
The death of a disco dancer
well, I'd rather not get involved
I never talk to my neighbour
I'd just rather not get involved
Love, peace and harmony?
Love, peace and harmony?
Oh, very nice, very nice, very nice, very nice
...but maybe in the next world.

 

GIRLFRIEND IN A COMA

Girlfriend in a coma, I know
I know - it's serious
Girlfriend in a coma, I know
I know - it's really serious
there wree times when I could
have 'murdered' her
(but, you know, I would hate
anything to happen to her)
NO, I DON'T WANT TO SEE HER
Do you really think
she'll pull through?
Do you really think
she'll pull through?
Girlfriend in a coma, I know
I know, it's serious
there were time when I could
have 'strangeled' her
(but, you know, I would hate
anything to happen to her)
WOULD YOU PLEASE LET ME SEE HER!
Do you really think she'll pull through?
Do you really think she'll pull through?
Let me wisper my last goodbyes
I know - IT'S SERIOUS

 

STOP ME IF YOU'VE HEARD THIS ONE BEFORE

Stop me, stop me,
stop me if you think that you've heard this one before
stop me, stop me
stop me if you think that you've heard this one before
nothing's changed
I still love you, oh I still love you
...only slightly less than I used to
I was delayed, I was way-laid
an emergency stop
I smelt the last ten seconds of life
I crashed down on the crossbar
and the pain was enough to make
a shy, bald buddhist reflect
and plan a mass-murder
who said I'd lied to her?
who said I'd lied because I never
who said I'd lied because I never
I was detained, I was restrained
he broke my spleen
he broke my knees
(and then he really laid into me)
Friday night in Out-patients
who said I'd lied to her?
who said I'd lied - because I never
who said I'd lied - because I never
Oh, so I drank one
or was it four
and when I fell on the floor
...I drank more
stop me, stop me
stop me if you think that you've heard this one before
nothing's changed
I still love you, I still love you
but only slightly
less than I used to

 

LAST NIGHT I DREAMT THAT SOMEBODY LOVED ME

Last night I dreamt
that somebody loved me
no hope - but no harm
just another false alarm
Las night I felt
real arms around me
no hope - no harm
just another false alarm
so, tell me how long
before the last one?
and tell me how long
before the right one?
this story is old - I KNOW
but it goes on
this story is old - I KNOW
but it goes on

 

UNHAPPY BIRTHDAY

I've come to wish you an unhappy birthday
I've come to wish you an unhappy birthday
because you're evil
and you lie
and if you should die
I may feel slightly sad
(but I won't cry)
Loved and lost
and some may say
when usually its Nothing
surely you're happy
it should be this way?
I say "No, I'm gonna kill my dog"
and: "May the lines sag heavy
and deep tonight XXX"
I've come to wish you an unhappy birthday
I've come to wish you an unhappy birthday
because you're evil
and you lie
and if you should die
I may feel slightly sad
(But I won't cry)
Loved and lost
some people say
when usually its Nothing
surely you're happy
it should be this way?
I said "No"
and then I shot myself
so, drink, drink, drink
and be ill tonight
from the one you left behind
from the one you left behind...

 

PAINT A VULGAR PICTURE

At the record company meeting
On their hands - a dead star
and ooh, the plans that they weave
and ooh, the sikening greed
At the record company meeting
on their hands - a dead star
the sycophantic slags all say:
"I knew him first, and I knew him well"
Re-issue! Re-package! Re-package!
Re-evaluate the songs
double-pack with a photograph
Extra Track (and a tacky badge)
A-list, playlist
"Please them, please them!"
"Please them! Please them!"
(sadly, THIS was your life)
but you could have said no
if you'd wanted to
you could have said no
if you'd wanted to
BPI, MTV, BBC
"Please them! Please them!"
(sadly this was your life)
but you could have said no
if you'd wanted to
you could have walked away
...couldn't you?
I touched you at the soundcheck
you had no real way of knowing
in my heart I bgged "please, take
me with you...
I don't care where you're going"
But to you I was faceless
I was fawning, I was boring
just a child from those ugly new houses
who could never begin to know
who could never really know
Best of? Most of?
Satiate the need
slip them into different sleeves!
Buy both, and be decieved
climber - new entry, re-entry
World tour! ("media whore")
"Please the Press in Belgium!"
(THIS was your life...)
and when it fails to recoup?
Well, maybe:
You just haven't earned it yet, baby
I walked a pace behind you at the soundcheck
you're just the same as I am
what makes most people feel happy
leads us headlong into harm
so, in my bedroom in those 'ugly new houses'
I dance my legs down to the knees
but me and my 'true love'
we will never meet again...
At the record company meeting
on their hands - at last! - a dead star!
but they cannot taint you in my eyes
no, they cannout touch you now
No, they cannot hurt you my darling
they cannot touch you now
but me and my 'true love'
will never meet again

 

DEATH AT ONE'S ELBOW

Ooh Glenn, don't come to the house tonight
Ooh, Glenn, don't come to the house tonight
because there's somebody here
who really really loves you
stay home
be bored
(it's crap, I KNOW)
Ooh, Glenn, don't come to the house tonight
Ooh, Glen, don't come to the house tonight
because there's somebody here
who'll take a hatchet to your ear
how the frustration renders me
hateful, Glenn!
don't come to the house tonight
don't come to the house tonight
because you'll slip on the
trail of my bespattered remains
and so, that's why
GOODBYE MY LOVE, GOODBYE MY LOVE, GOODBYE MY LOVE...
Belch

 

I WON'T SHARE YOU

I won't share you
I won't share you
with the drive and ambition
and the zeal I feel
this is my time
as the note I wrote
was read, she said
has the Perrier gone
straight to my head
or is life plainly sick and cruel, instead?
"YES!"
No-no-no-no-no-no
I won't share you
I won't share you
with the drive and the dreams inside
this is my time
Life tends to come and go
well, that's OK
just as long as you know
Life tends to come and go
well, that's OK
just as long as you know
I won't share you
I won't share you
with the drive and the dreams inside
this is my time, this is my time


THE QUEEN IS DEAD

Farewell to this lands cheerless marches
hemmed in like a boar between arches
her very Lowness with her head in a sling
Im truely sorry-but it sounds like a wonderful thing
dear Charles, dont you ever crave
to appear on the front of the Daily mail
dressed in your Mother's bridal veil?
So, I checked all the registered historical facts
and I was shocked into shame to discover
how Im the 18th pale descendent
of some, old queen or other
has the world changed, or have I changed?
has the world changed, or have I changed?
as some 9-year old tough peddles drugs
(I never even knew what drugs were)
And so, I broke into the Palace
with a sponge and a rusty spanner
she said: "Eh, I know you, and you cannot sing"
I said: "that's nothing -you should hear me play piano"
We can go for a walk where it's quiet and dry
and we can talk about precious things
but when you are tied to your mother's apron
not one talks about castration
We can go for a walk where it's quiet and dry
and we can talk about precious things
like love and law and poverty
these are the things that kill me
We can go for a walk where it's quiet and dry
and we can talk about precious things
but the rain that flattens my hair
theses are the things that kill me
Passed the Pub that saps your body
and the church who'll snatch your money
the Queen is dead, boys
and it's so lonely on a limb
Pass the Pub that wrecks your body
and the church-all they want is your money
the Queen is dead, boys`
you can trust me, boys
life is very long, when you're lonely
life is very long, when you're lonely...

 

PANIC

Panic on the streets of London
Panic on the streets of Birmingham
I wonder to myself
Could life ever be sane again
on the Leeds side-streets that you slip down
I wonder to myself
Hopes may rise on the Grasmeres
But Honey Pie, you're not safe here
So you run down
To the safety of the town
But there's Panic on the streets of Carlisle
Dublin, Dundee, Humberside
I wonder to myself
Burn down the Disco
Hang the blessed D.J.
Because the music that they constantly play
IT SAYS NOTHING TO ME ABOUT MY LIFE
Hang the blessed D.J.
Because the music they constantly play
On the Leeds side-streets that you slip down
On the provincial towns that you jog 'round
Hang the D.J.,. Hang the D.J.,.Hang the D.J...

 

VICAR IN A TUTU

I was minding mind business
lifting some lead off
the roof of the Holy Name church
it was worthwhile living a laughable life
just to set my eyes on a blistering sight
of a vicar in a tu-tu
he's not strange
he just wants to live his life this way
a scanty bit of a thing
with a decorative ring
that wouldn't cover the head of a child
as Rose collects the money in the cannister
who comes sliding down the bannister
the vicar in a tu-tu
he's not strange
he just wants to live his life this way
the monkish monsignor
with a head full of plaster
said "my man, get your vile soul dry-cleaned"
as Rose counts the money in the cannister
as natural as rain
he dances again
vicar in a tu-tu
The next day in the pulpit
with Freedom and Ease
combating ignoranca,dust and disease
as Rose counts the money in the cannister
as natural as rain
he dances again
the fabric of a tu-tu
any man could get us to
and I am a living sign.

 

ASK

Shyness is nice, but
Shyness can stop you
From doing all the things in life
That you'd like to
So, if there's something you'd like to try
ASK ME-I WON'T SAY "NO"-HOW COULD I?
Coyness is nice, but ,
Coyness can stop you
from saying all the things in
life that you want to
If there's something that you'd like to try
ASK ME-I WON'TSAY"NO"-HOW COULD I?
Spending warm, Summer days indoors
Writing fringhtening verse
To a buck-toothed girl in Luxembourg
ASK ME, ASK ME ,ASK ME, ASK ME, ASK ME ,ASK ME
Because if it's not Love
Then it's the Bomb
That will bring us together
Nature is a language-can't you read?
Nature is a language-can't you read?
ASK ME, ASK ME ,ASK ME, ASK ME, ASK ME ,ASK ME
Because if it's not Love
Then it's the Bomb
That will bring us together

 

MARIE'S THE NAME (HIS LATEST FLAME) / RUSHOLME RUFFIANS

Very old friend 
Came by today 
As he was telling everyone in town 
Of all the love that he'd just found 
And Marie's the name (of his latest flame) 
Talked and talked 
And I heard him say 
That she had the longest blackest hair 
Prettiest green eyes anywhere 
And Marie's the name (of his latest flame) 
The last night of the fair 
By the big wheel generator 
A boy is stabbed 
His money is grabbed 
And the air hangs heavy like a dulling wine 
She is Famous 
She is Funny 
An engagement ring 
Doesn't mean a thing 
To a mind consumed by brass (money), oh 
The last night of the fair 
From a seat on a whirling waltzer 
Her skirt ascends for a watching eye 
It's a hideous trait (on her mother's side)
From a seat on a whirling waltzer 
Her skirt ascends for a watching eye 
A hideous trait (on her mother's side) 
Then someone falls in love 
Someone's beaten up 
Someone's beaten up 
And the senses being dulled are mine 
And someone falls in love 
Someone's beaten up 
And the senses being dulled are mine 
This is the last night of the fair 
And the grease in the hair 
Of a speedway operator 
Is all a tremulous heart requires 
A schoolgirl is denied 
She said : "How quickly would I die 
If I jumped from the top of the parachutes ?"
This is the last night of the fair 
And the grease in the hair 
Of a speedway operator 
Is all a tremulous heart requires 
A schoolgirl is denied 
She said : "How quickly would I die 
Oh, if I jumped from the top of the parachutes ?"
...Oh, walk home alone 
I might walk home alone 
But my faith in love is still devout

 

THE BOY WITH THE THORN IN HIS SIDE

The boy with the thorn in his side
behind the hatred there lies
a murderous desire for love
how can they look into my eyes
and still they dont believe me
how can they hear me say those words
and still they dont believe me
and if they don't believe me now
will they ever believe me?
and if they don't believe me now
will they ever believe me?
The boy with the thorn in his side
behind the hatred there lies
a plundering desire for love
how can they see the Love in our eyes
and still they don't believe us
and after all this time
they don't want to believe us
and if they dont believe us now
will they ever believe us ?
andd when you want to Live
how do you start ?
where do you go ?
who do you know?

 

RUBBER RING / WHAT SHE SAID

Yeah! What she says : 
"How come someone hasn't noticed 
That I'm dead 
And decided to bury me ? 
God knows, I'm ready !"
La-la-la ... 
What she said was sad 
But then, all the rejection she's had 
To pretend to be happy 
Could only be idiocy 
La-la-la ... 
What she said was not for the job or 
Lover that she never had 
No no no ... 
What she read 
All heady books 
She'd sit and prophesise 
(It took a tattooed boy from 
Birkenhead 
To really really open her eyes)
What she read 
All heady books 
She'd sit and prophesise 
(It took a tattooed boy from 
Birkenhead 
To really really open her eyes)
What she said : 
"I smoke because I'm hoping for an 
Early death 
AND I NEED TO CLING TO SOMETHING !"
What she said : 
"I smoke because I'm hoping for an 
Early death

No no no no ...

 

IS IT REALLY SO STRANGE?

I left the North 
I travelled South 
I found a tiny house 
And I can't help the way I feel 
Oh yes, you can kick me 
And you can punch me 
And you can break my face 
But you won't change the way I feel 
'Cause I love you, Oh ... 
And is it really so strange ? 
Oh, is it really so strange ? 
Oh, is it really so, really so strange ? 
I say NO, you say YES 
(and you will change your mind) 
I left the South 
I travelled North 
I got confused - I killed a horse 
I can't help the way I feel 
Oh yes, you can punch me 
And you can butt me 
And you can break my spine 
But you won't change the way I feel 
'Cause I love you, Oh ... 
And is it really so strange ? 
Oh, is it really so strange ? 
Oh, is it really so, really so strange ? 
I say NO, you say YES 
(But you will change your mind) 
I left the North again 
I travelled South again 
And I got confused - I killed a nun 
I CAN'T HELP THE WAY I FEEL 
(I lost my bag in Newport Pagnell) 
Why is the last mile the hardest mile ? 
My throat was dry, with the sun in my eyes 
And I realised, I realised 
I could never 
I could never, never, never, go back home again

 

CEMETERY GATES

A dreaded sunny day
so I meet you at the cemetry gates
Keats and Yeats are on your side
A dreaded sunny day
so I meet you at the cemetry gates
Keats and Yeats are on your side
while Wilde is on mine
So we go inside and we gravely read the stones
all those people all those lives
where are they now ?
with loves, and hates
and passions just like mine
they were born
and then they lived and then they died
which seems so unfair
and I wantr to crv
You say: "ere thrice the sun hath done salutation to the dawn"
and you claim these words as your own
but Im well-read, have heard them said
a hundred times (maybe less, maybe more)
if you must write prose/poems
the words you use should be your own
dont plagiarise or take "on loans"
there's alweays someone, somewhere
with a big nose, who knows
and who trips you up and laughs
when you fall
You say: "ere long done do does did "
words which could only be your own
you then produce the text
from whence was ripped
(some dizzy whore, 1804)
A dreaded sunny day
so let's go where we're happy
so I meet you at the cemetry gates
Keats and Yeats are on your side
A dreaded sunny day
so let's go where we're wanted
so I meet you at the cemetry gates
Keats and Yeats are on your side
but you lose
because Wilde is on mine

 

LONDON

Smoke
Lingers 'round your fingers
Train
Heave on - to Euston
Do you think you've made
The right decision this time?
You left
Your tired family grieving
And you think they're sad because you're leaving
But didn't you see the Jealousy in the eyes
Of the ones who had to stay behind?
And do you think you've made
The right decision thins time?
You left
Your girlfriend on the platform
With thei really ragged notion that you'll return
But she knows
That when he goes
He really goes
So do you think you've made
The right decision this time?

 

I KNOW IT'S OVER

I can feel the soil falling over my head 
And as I climb into an empty bed 
Oh well. Enough said. 
I know it's over - still I cling 
I don't know where else I can go 
Over ... 
Oh Mother, I can feel the soil falling over my head 
See, the sea wants to take me 
The knife wants to cut me 
Do you think you can help me ? 
Sad veiled bride, please be happy 
Handsome groom, give her room 
Loud, loutish lover, treat her kindly 
(Though she needs you 
More than she loves you) 
And I know it's over - still I cling 
I don't know where else I can go 
Over, it's over, it's over, it's over 
It's over, la ... 
I know it's over 
And it never really began 
But in my heart it was so real
And you even spoke to me, and said : 
"If you're so funny 
Then why are you on your own tonight ? 
And if you're so clever 
Then why are you on your own tonight ? 
I know ... 
'Cause tonight - it's just like any other night 
That's why you're on your own tonight 
Your triumphs and your charms 
While they're in each other's arms..."
It's so easy to laugh 
It's so easy to hate 
It takes strength to be gentle and kind 
Over, over, over, over 
It's so easy to laugh 
It's so easy to hate 
It takes guts to be gentle and kind 
Over, over 
Love is Natural and Real 
But not for you, my love 
Not tonight, my love 
Love is Natural and Real 
But not for such as you and I, my love 
Oh Mother, I can feel the soil falling over my head...
Oh Mother, I can feel the soil fall over, fall over my head 
Oh Mother, I can feel the ... fall over my ... , Oh ...

 

THE DRAIZE TRAIN

A vastly superior version of the instrumental B-side, acting as a peace 
offering to Marr (Morrissey chose the tracks for the compilation, 
and of course, receives no royalties on this track).

 

STILL ILL

I decree today that life
is simply taking and not giving
England is mine and it owes me a living
ask me why, and I'll spit in your eye
ask me why, and I'll spit in your eye
but we cannot cling to the old dreams anymore
no, we cannot cling to the old dreams anymore
Does the body rule the mind
or does the mind rule the body?
I dunno...
Under the iron bridge we kissed
and although I ended up with sore lips
it just wasn't like the old days anymore
no, it wasn't like those days
am I still ill?
Does the body rule the mind
or does the mind rule the body ?
I dunno...
Ask me why, and I'll die
ask me why, and I'll die
and if you must go to work tomorrow
well, if I were you I wouldn't bother
for there are brighter sides to life
and I should know because I've seen them
but not very often...
under the iron bridge we kissed
and although I ended up with sore lips
it just wasn't like the old days anymore
no, it wasn't like those days
am I still ill?

 

BIGMOUTH STRIKES AGAIN

Sweetness, sweetness I was only joking
when I said Id like to smash every tooth
in your head
Sweetness, sweetness I was only joking
when I said by right s you should be
bludgeoned in your bed
and now I know how Joan of Arc felt
now I know how Joan of Arc felt
as the flames roseto her roman nose
and her Walkman stared to melt
Bibmouth, bigmouth
bigmouth strikes again
and Ive got no right to take my place
with the Human race
and now I know how Joan of Arc felt
now I know of Joan of Arc felt
as the flames rose to her roman nose
and her hearing aid started to melt
Bigmouth, bigmouth
bigmouth strikes again
and Ive got no right to take my place
with the Human race

 
ALSATIAN COUSTIN

Were you and he Lovers?
and would you say so if you were?
on a forecourt
on a Friday
passing my way
Were you and he Lovers?
and if you were, then say that you were!
on a groundsheet
under canvas
with your tent-flap
open wide
A note upon his desk:
"P.S. Bring Me Home And Have Me!"
Leather elbows on a tweed coat
- Oh! -
Is THAT the best you can do?
So came his reply:
"...but on the desk is where I want you!"
So I ask (even though I know):
were you and he Lovers?

 

LITTLE MAN, WHAT NOW?

An afternoon nostalgia
television show
you spoke in silhouette
(but they couldn't name you)
although the panel were
very polite to you
but I remembered you
from Friday nights 1969
ATV - you murdered every line
too old to be a child star
too young to take leads
four seasons passed
and they AXED you
nervously juvenile
(WON'T SMILE!)
What became of you?
did that swift eclipse torture you?
a star at eighteen
and then-suddenly gone
down to a few lines
in the back page of a teenage annual
oh but I remembered you
I looked up to you

 

EVERYDAY IS LIKE SUNDAY

Trudging slowly over wet sand
back to the bench
where your clothes were stolen
this is the coastal town
that they forgot to close down
Armageddon - come Armageddon!
Come Armageddon! Come!
Everyday is like Sunday
everyday is silent and grey
Hide on the promenade
scratch out a postcard
"how I dearly with I was not here"
in the seaside town
...that they forgot to bomb
Come! Come! Come - nuclear bomb!
Everyday is like Sunday
everyday is silent and grey
Trudging back over pebbles and sand
and a strange dust lands on your hands
(and on your face)
Everyday is like Sunday
"Win Yourself A Cheap Tray"
share some greased tea with me
everyday is silent and grey

 

BENGALI IN PLATFORMS

No no no
he does not want to depress you
oh no no no no no
he only wants to impress you
Bengali in platform
she only wants to embrace your culture
and to be your friend forever
Bengali, Bengali
oh shelve your Western plans
and understand that life is hard enough when you belong here
A silver-studded rim that glistens
and an ankle-star that...blinds me
a lemon sole so very high
which only reminds me, to tell you
so I break the news gently
I break the news to you gently
"Shelve your plans"
Bengali, Bengali
its the touchy march of time
that blinds you
don't blame me
don't hate me
just because I'm the one to tell you
that life is hard enough when you belong here
life is hard enough when you belong here
shelve your western plans
life is hard enough when you belong here

 

ANGEL, ANGEL, DOWN WE GO TOGETHER

Angel, Angel
don't take your life tonight
I know they take
and that they take in turn
and they give you nothing real
for yourself in return
and when they've used you
and they've broken you
and wasted all your money
and cast your shell aside
and when they've bought you
and they've sold you
and they've billed you for the pleasure
and they've made your parents cry
I will be here
BELIEVE ME
I will be here
...believe me
Angel, don't take your life
some people have got no pride
they do not understand
the Urgency of life
but I love you more than life
I love you more than life
I love you more than life
I love you more than life

 

LALE NIGHT, MAUDLIN STREET

The last night on Maudlin Street
goodbye house
goodbye stairs
I was born here
I was raised here, and
...I took some stick here
love at first sight
may sound trite
but it's true, you know
I could list the details
of everything you ever wore
or said, or how you stood that day
and as we spend the last night
on Maudlin Street, I say
"goodbye house-forever!"
I never stole a happy hour
around here
Where the world's ugliest boy
became what you see
here I am - the ugliest man
Its the last night on Maudlin Street
and truly I do love you
oh, truly I do love you
When I sleep with that picture of
you framed beside my bed
oh, it's childish and it's silly
but I think it's you in my room
by the bed (...yes, I told you it was silly...)
and I know
I took strange pills
but I never meant to hurt you
oh truly I love you
I came home late one night
everyone had gone to bed
nobody stays up for you
when you have sixteen stitches
all around your head
the last buss I missed to Maudlin Street
so, he drove me home in the Van
complaining: "Women only like me for my mind..."
don't leave your torch behind
power-cuts ahead
as we crept through the park
but no I cannot steal a pair of jeans
off a clothesline for you
but you...without clothes
oh I could not keep a straight face
me - without clothes?
well a nation turns its back and gags...
I'm packed
I am moving house
a half-life disappears today
every slag waves me on
(secretly wishing me gone
well, I will be soon
oh - I will be soon)
There were bad times on Maudlin Street
when they took you away in a police car
dear Inspector - don't you know?
don't you care?
don't you know - about Love?
Your gran died
and your mother died
on Maudlin Street
in pain and ashamed
with never time to say
those special things
I took the keys from Maudlin Street
well, it's only bricks and mortar!
and...truly I do love you
wherever you are
wherever you are

 

SUEDHEAD

Why do you come here
why do you hang around
I'm so sorry
I'm so sorry
Why do you come here
when you know it makes
things hard for me
when you know, oh
why do you come?
Why do you telephone?
and why send me silly notes?
I'm so sorry
I'm so sorry
why do you come here
when you know it makes
thing hard for me
when you know, oh
why do you come?
You had to sneak into my room
'just' to read my diary
was it just to see all the things
you knew I'd written about you?
and...so many illustrations
I'm so very sickened
oh, I am so sickened NOW

 

BREAK UP THE FAMILY

The strange logic of your clumsiest line
stayed emblazoned on my mind
break up the family
and lets begin to live our lives
I went to see all my friends tonight
it wasn't Youth, it wasn't even Life
born Old, sadly wise
resigned (well, we were)
to ending our lives
I'm so glad to grow older
to move away from those awful times
I want to see all my friends tonight
Yes you found love but you weren't
at peace with your life
home late, full of Hate
despise the ties that bind
oh I'm so glad to grow older
to move away from those younger years
now I'm in love for the first time
and I don't feel bad
Let me see all my old friends
let me put my arm around them
because I really do love them
now, does that sound mad?
Captain of games, solid framed
I stood on the touchline
hailstones, driven home
in his car - no breaks? I don't mind
I'm just so glad to grow older
to move away from those darker years
I'm in love for the first time
and I don't feel bad
so wish me luck my friends
goodbye

 

HAIRDRESSER ON FIRE

Here is London
here is London
is it home of the free,
or what?
can you squeeze me
into an empty page of your diary
and psychologically save me
I've got faith in you
I sense the power
in the fingers
within an hour the power
can totally destroy me
or it could same my life
here is London
'home of the brash, outrageous
and free'
you are repressed
but you're remarkably dressed
is it Real?
but you're far to busy
busy scissors
busy clippers
hair dresser on fire
all around Sloane Square
and you're far too busy
to see me
"busy,busy"
hairdresser on fire
was a client over-cautious
he made you nervous
and when he said
"I'm gonna sue you"
I really felt for you
so can you squeeze me
into an empty page of your diary
and supernaturally change me
CHANGE ME, CHANGE ME

 

THE ORDINARY BOYS

Ordinary boys, happy knowing nothing
happy being no one, but themselves
Ordinary girls, supermarket clothes
who think it's very clever to be cruel to you
for you were so different
you stood all alone
and you knew
that it had to be so
avoiding ordinary boys
happy going nowhere, just around here
in their rattling cars
and ordinary girls
never seeing further
than the cold, small streets
that trap them
but you were so different
you had to say no
when those empty fools
tried to change you, and claim you
for the lair of their ordinary world
where they feel so lucky
so lucky, so lucky
with their lives laid out before them
they're so lucky, so lucky
so lucky, so lucky

 

I DON'T MIND IF YOU FORGET ME

I don't mind
I don't mind if you forget me
having learned my lesson
I never left an impression on anyone
so now you send me your hardened 'regards'
when once you'd send me 'love'
sincerely I must tell you
your mild 'best wishes'
they make me suspicious
but I don't mind
I don't mind if you forget me
having learned my lesson
I never left
an impression on anyone
the pressure to change, to move on
was strange
and very strong
so this is why I tell you
I really do understand
BYE BYE
I don't mind if you forget me
no no no no no no no
REJECTION IS ONE THING
BUT REJECTION FROM A FOOL
IS CRUEL
REJECTION IS ONE THING
BUT REJECTION FROM A FOOL
IS CRUEL
and I don't mind if you forget me
I don't mind if your forget me

 

DIAL-A-CLICHE

Further into the fog I fall
well, I was just
following you!
when you said:
"Do as I do and scrap your fey ways"
(dial-a-cliche)
"grow up, be a man, and close your mealy-mouth!"
(dial-a-cliche)
But the person underneath
where does he go?
does he slide by the wayside?
or...does he just die?
when you find that you've organized
your feelings, for people
who didn't like you then
and certainly don't like you now
yet still you say:
"Do as I do and scrap your fey ways"
(dial-a-cliche)
"grow up, be a man, and close your mealy-mouth!"
(dial-a-cliche)
"the Safe way is the only way!
there's always time to change, son!"
yes well I've changed
but I'm in pain!
dial-a-chiche

 

MARGARET ON THE GUILLOTINE

The kind people
have a wonderful dream
Margaret on the guillotine
because people like you
make me feel so tired
when will you die?
when will you die?
when will you die?
when will you die?
when will you die?
because people like you
make me feel so old inside
please die
and kind people
do not shelter this dream
make it real
make the dream real
make the dream real
make it real

 

OUR FRANK

Our frank and open
deep conversations
they get me nowhere
they bring me down, so
give it a rest, won't you?
give me a cigarette
God give me patience
just no more conversation
Give us a drink
and make it quick
or else I'm gonna be sick
sick all over
your frankly vulgar
red pullover
now see how the colours blend
Our frank and open
deep conversations
they get me nowhere
they bring me down, so
give it a rest, won't you?
now will you just give over
the world may be ending
but look, I'm only human
Give us a drink
and make it quick
or else I'm gonna be sick
all over
your frankly vulgar
red pullover
now see how the two colours blend
Won't somebody stop me
from thinking all the time
about everything
so deeply
so bleakly

 

ASIAN RUT

Day oh so late
strangely the sun still shone
oh Asian boy
what are you on?
Day oh so late
strangely the sun still shone
what drugs are you on?
Tooled-up Asian boy
has come here to avenge
the cruel, cold killing
of his very best friend
Tooled-up Asian boy
has come here to take revenge
for the cruel, cold killing
of his only friend
Peace through the school
so quiet in the hall
it's a strange sign for one
of what's to come
Tough and hard and pale
oh they may just impale you on railings
oh English boys
it must be wrong
three against one?
Brakes slammed, and
a gun jammed, and
as far as I could tell
brave Asian boy
dealt a blow and fell
I'm just passing through here
on my way to somewhere civilised
and maybe I'll even arrive
maybe I'll even arrive?

 

SING YOUR LIFE

Sing your life
any fool can think of words that rhyme
many others do
why don't you?
do you want to?
Sing your life
just walk right up to the microphone
and name
all the things that you love
all the things that you loathe
sing your life
all the things that you love
all the things that you loathe
oh sing your life
oh sing your life
Others sang your life
but now's your chance to shine
and have the pleasure of
saying what you mean
the rare pleasure of
meaning what you sing
oh, make no mistake, my friend
all of this will end
so sing it now
all the things you love
all the things you loathe
oh sing your life
all the things that you love
all the things that you loathe
oh sing your, oh sing your
Don't leave it all unsaid
somewhere in the wasteland of your head
and make no mistake, my friend
your pointless life will end
but before you go
can you look at the truth?
You have a lovely singing voice
a lovely singing voice
and all of those
who sing on key
they stole the notion
from you and me

 

MUTE WITNESS

Your poor witness
crying so loudly on the floor
oh but she's only trying to tell you
what it was that she saw
she is only trying to tell you
what it was that she saw
Now see her standing on the table
with her small arms flailing
and you feel such compassion
in your soul for
Your poor mute witness
still testing the strength
of our patience
oh but she's only trying to tell you
what it was that she saw
Now see her pointing to the frisbee
with a memory too fuzzy
as her silent words
describe the fright of last night
4 a.m. Norhtside, Clapham Common
who knows what she was doing there?
will she sketch the answer later?
Well, I'll ask her
"now dry your tears, my dear"
Now see her mime in time so nicely
it would all have been so clear
is only she had never volunteered
"your taxi is here, my dear"

 

KING LEER

Your boyfriend, he
went down on one knee
well, could it be
he's only got one knee?
I tried to surprise you
with Vodka
or, Tizer
I can't quite remember
but you didn't thank me
you didn't even thank me
because you never do
Your boyfriend, he
has the gift of the gab
or, could it be
the gift of the grab?
I tried to surprise you
I lay down beside you
and...nothing much happened
and you didn't phone me
you didn't even phone me
because it's not your style
to dial
Your boyfriend, he
displays to me
more than just
a hint of cruelty
I tried to surprise you
I crept up behind you
with a homeless chihuahua
you gushed for an hour
you handed him back and said
"You'll never guess
I'm bored now"

 

FOUND FOUND FOUND

found found found found found found
someone who's worth it
in this murkiness
someone who's never
seeming scheming
found found found found found found
someone who's worth it
in this murkiness
someone who's never
seeming scheming
Oh, but if I'd never found
oh, but if I'd never found
oh, but if I'd never found
I do believe that
the more you give your love
and I do believe that
the more you offer trust
the more you chase
the more you cry
the more you're bound to lose
the more you're bound to lose
Oh, but if I'd never found
oh, but if I'd never found
somebody
who wants to be
who wants to be
with me
all the time

 

DRIVING YOUR GIRLFRIEND HOME

I'm driving
your girlfriend home
and she's saying
how she never chose you
"turn left", she says
so I turn left
and she says
"So how did I end up
so deeply involved in
the very existence
I planned on avoiding?"
and I can't answer
I'm driving
your girlfriend home
and she's laughing
to stop herself crying
"drive on", she says
so I drive on
and she says
"So how did I end up
attached to this person
when his sense of humour
gets gradually worser?"
and I can't tell her
I'm parking
outside her home
and we're shaking hands
goodnight, so politely

 

THE HARSH TRUTH OF THE CAMERA EYE

Churchillian legs
hair barely there
the harsh truth of the camera eye
Your eyes signal pain
because of the strain
of smiling
the harsh truth of the camera eye
telling you all
that you never wnated to know
showing what
you didn't want shown
My so friendly lens
zooms into
"the inner you"
and it tells the harsh truth
and nothing but
Laugh with us all here
that's if you can
then take the pictures home
and screamtelling you all
that you never wanted to know
showing you what
you didn't want shown
This photographer
he must have really had it in for you
"Oh, I don't want
to be judged anymore
I don't wnat to be judged
I would sooner be Loved
I would sooner be
just blindly Loved..."

 

(I'M) THE END OF THE FAMILY LINE

With no complications
fifteen generations
(of mine)
all honouring Nature
until I arrive
(with incredible style)
I'm the end fo the line
the end of the family line
the end of the line
No baby pulled screaming
out into this seething whirl
by chance or whim
(or even love?)
our family tree hacked into decline
and I'm spared the pain
of ever saying
("goodbye")
I'm the end of the line
the end of the family line
the end of the line

 

THERE'S A PLACE IN HELL FOR ME AND MY FRIENDS

There is a place
reserved
for me and my friends
and when we go
we all will go
so you see
I'm never alone
there is a place
with a bit more time
and a few more
gentler words
and looking back
we do forgive
(we had no choice
we always did)
all that we hope
is that when we go
our skin
and our blood
and our bones
don't get in your way
making you ill
the way they did
when we lived
There is a place
a place in hell
reserved
for me and my friends
and if ever I
wanted to cry
then I will
because I can

 

TONY THE PONY

Still drinking on the corner 
Just don't say I didn't warn you 
Always nagging big brother 
He's only looking out for you 
Tony The Pony 
Tony The Pony 
You're still standing on the corner 
Just don't say I didn't warn you 
Old and jealous big brother 
You had your time and you spent it 
Crying 
Now, Tony The Pony 
Tony The Pony 
So, that's what they call you now ? 
When you're free outside 
So cold and hard and in control 
And ... 
There's a free ride on 
Tony The Pony 
Oh, why do you always wanna stop me 
From doing the things in life that make me happy ? 
And when I'm outside with friends, laughing loudly 
Why do you always wanna stop me ? 
Oh, I would never 
I would never 
But you will carry the can for anyone 
The free ride on 
Gullible Tony 
You're drunker quicker 
And you're sicker even quicker 
For something heavy is gonna fall on you 
Oh ... 
And what do they call you now ? 
When you're free outside 
So cold and hard and in control 
And, oh ... been a lark 
There's a free ride on 
Fucked-up Tony 
I will never say I told you so 
Or how I knew that something bad 
Would happen to you 
I don't wanna say I told you so 
Oh, but Tony, I told you so !!! 
I told you so

 

YOU'RE GONNA NEED SOMEONE ON YOUR SIDE

With the world's fate 
Resting on your shoulder 
You're gonna need 
Someone on your side 
You can't do it by yourself 
Any longer 
You're gonna need 
Someone on your side 
Someone kindly told me 
That you'd wasted 
Eight of nine lives
Oh, give yourself a break 
Before you break down 
You're gonna need someone on your side 
And here I am, And here I am 
Well, you don't need 
To look so pleased ! 
Day or night, 
There is no difference 
You're gonna need someone on your side 
Day or night, 
There is no difference 
You're gonna need someone soon 
And here I am, And here I am 
Well, you don't need 
To look so pleased

 

GLAMOROUS GLUE

First day with the jar 
You find 
Everyone lies 
First day with the jar 
You find 
Everyone lies, nobody minds 
Everyone lies 
Where is the man you respect ? 
And where is the woman you love ? 
Where's the woman you love ? 
Third week with the jar
You find 
Everything dies 
We won't vote Conservative 
Because we never have 
Everyone lies, everyone lies 
Where is the man you respect ? 
And where is the woman you love ? 
Where's the woman you love ? 
Everything of worth 
On Earth Is there To share 
I used to dream, and I used to vow 
I wouldn't dream of it now 
We look to Los Angeles 
For the language we use 
London is dead, London is dead, London is dead...
Now I'm too much in love 
I'm too much in love 
I know 
I'll go 
Empty hand 
From the land

 

WE'LL LET YOU KNOW

How sad are we ? 
And how sad have we been ? 
We'll let you know 
We'll let you know 
Oh, but only if - you're really interested 
You wonder how 
We've stayed alive 'till now 
We'll let you know 
We'll let you know 
But only if - you're really interested 
We're all smiles 
Then, honest, I swear, it's the turnstiles 
That make us hostile 
Oh ... 
We will descend 
On anyone unable to defend 
Themselves 
Oh ... 
And the songs we sing 
They're not supposed to mean a thing 
La, la, la, la ... 
Oh ...You're lonely, Oh ... you're lonely, Oh ... 
GET OFF THE ROOF ! Oh ... 
Your Arsenal !
We may seem cold, or 
We may even be 
The most depressing people you've ever known 
At heart, what's left, we sadly know 
That we are the last truly British people you'll ever know 
We are the last truly British people you will ever know 
You'll never never want to know

 

THE NATIONAL FRONT DISCO

David, the wind blows 
The wind blows ... 
Bits of your life away 
Your friends all say ... 
"Where is our boy ? Oh, we've lost our boy" 
But they should know 
Where you've gone 
Because again and again you've explained that 
You're going to ... 
Oh, you're going to ... 
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah 
England for the English ! 
England for the English ! 
David, the winds blow 
The winds blow ...
All of my dreams away 
And I still say : 
"Where is our boy ? Ah, we've lost our boy" 
But I should know 
Why you've gone 
Because again and again you've explained
You've gone to the ... 
National, ah ... 
To the National .. 
There's a country; you don't live there 
But one day you would like to 
And if you show them what you're made of 
Oh, then you might do ... 
But David, we wonder 
We wonder if the thunder 
Is ever really gonna begin 
Begin, begin 
Your mom says : 
"I've lost my boy" 
But she should know 
Why you've gone 
Because again and again you've explained 
You've gone to the : 
National 
To the National 
To the National Front Disco 
Because you want the day to come sooner 
You want the day to come sooner 
You want the day to come sooner 
When you've settled the score 
Oh, the National 
Oh, the National

 

CERTAIN PEOPLE I KNOW

I take the cue from 
Certain people I know 
I use the cue 
And then I 
Hand it on to you 
And when I swing it 
So, it catches his eye ... 
(Weren't you there ? 
- You'd have died !) 
I trust the views of 
Certain people I know 
They look at Danger 
And they 
LAUGH THEIR HEADS OFF 
Their clothes are Imitation 
George the 23rd 
(Don't you find this absurd ?) 
I'd hate to be like 
Certain people I know 
They break their necks 
And can't afford to
Get them fixed 
Ah, they'd sacrifice all 
Of their principles for 
anything cashable 
I do believe it's terrible 
Oh, wo, wo, Ah, ah, ah, ah, Oh, wo, wo...

 

WE HATE IT WHEN OUR FRIENDS BECOME SUCCESSFUL

We hate it when our friends become successful 
We hate it when our friends become successful 
Oh, look at those clothes 
Now look at that face, it's so old 
And such a video ! 
Well, it's really laughable 
Ha, ha, ha ...
We hate it when our friends become successful 
And if they're Northern, that makes it even worse
And if we can destroy them 
You bet your life we will 
Destroy them 
If we can hurt them 
Well, we may as well ... 
It's really laughable 
Ha, ha, ha ... 
You see, it should've been me 
It could've been me 
Everybody knows 
Everybody says so 
They say : 
"Ah, you have loads of songs 
So many songs 
More songs than they'd stand 
Verse 
Chorus 
Middle eight 
Break, fade 
Just listen ..."
La, la-la, la-la

SEASICK, YET STILL DOCKED

I am a poor freezingly cold soul 
So far from where 
I intended to go 
Scavenging through life's very constant lulls 
So far from where I'm determined to go 
Wish I knew the way to reach the one I love
There is no way ... 
Wish I had the charm to attract the one I love 
But you see, I've got no charm 
Mmm...
Tonight I've consumed much more than I can hold 
Oh, this is very clear to you 
And you can tell I have never really loved 
You can tell, by the way, I sleep all day
And all of my life no-one gave me anything 
No-one has ever given me anything 
My love is as sharp as a needle in your eye 
You must be such a fool 
To pass me by

 

I KNOW IT'S GONNA HAPPEN SOMEDAY

My love, wherever you are 
Whatever you are 
Don't lose faith 
I know it's gonna happen someday 
To you 
Please wait ... Please wait ... Oh ... Wait ... 
Don't lose faith 
You say that the day just never arrives 
And it's never seemed so far away 
Still, I know it's gonna happen someday 
To you 
Please wait ... 
Don't lose faith

 

TOMORROW

Tomorrow

All I ask of you is one thing that you never do 
Would you put your arms around me ?

Tomorrow 
Does it have to come ?
All I ask of you is one thing that you'll never do 
Would you put your arms around me ? 
(I won't tell anybody) 
Tomorrow 
And what must come before ...
Oh, the pain in my arms 
Oh, the pain in my legs 
Ooh, my shiftless body 
Tomorrow 
It's surely nearer now ? 
You don't think I'll make it 
I never said I wanted to ! 
Well did I ? 
Oh, the pain in my arms 
Oh, the pain in my legs 
Oh, yeah; oh, yeah, No, yeah; no, yeah 
Through my shiftless body 
Tomorrow, Tomorrow 
All I ask of you ... oh ... 
Is : would you tell me that you love me 
Tell me, tell me that you love me, Tell me, tell me that you love me ... 
Ah, I know you don't mean it 
Ah, I know you don't mean it 
Tell me, tell me that you love me, Tell me, tell me that you love me ...

NOVEMBER SPAWNED A MONSTER

Sleep on and dream of Love
because it's the closest you will get to love
poor twisted child, so ugly, so ugly
poor twisted child, oh hug me, oh hug me
one November spawned a monster 
in the shape of this child who later cried
"But Jesus made me, so Jesus save me from
pity, sympathy and people discussing me"
a frame of useless limbs what can make GOOD
all the BAD that's been done?
And if the lights were out
could you even bear
to kiss her full on the mouth (or anywhere?)
poor twisted child, so ugly, so ugly
poor twisted child, oh hug me, oh hug me
one November spawned a monster 
in the shape of this child who must remain
a hostage to kindess and the wheels underneath her
a hostage to kindess and the wheels underneath her
a symbol of where mad, mad lovers
must PAUSE and draw the line
So sleep and dream of love
because it's the closest
you will get to love
that November is a time which I must put OUT of my mind
oh one fine day 
LET IT BE SOON
she won't be rich or beautiful
but she'll be walking your streets
in the clothes that she went out
and chose for herself

 

SEASICK, YET STILL DOCKED

I am a poor freezingly cold soul 
So far from where

Scavenging through life's very constant lulls 
So far from where I'm determined to go

There is no way ... 
Wish I had the charm to attract the one I love 
But you see, I've got no charm 
Mmm...
Tonight I've consumed much more than I can hold 
Oh, this is very clear to you 
And you can tell I have never really loved 
You can tell, by the way, I sleep all day
And all of my life no-one gave me anything 
No-one has ever given me anything 
My love is as sharp as a needle in your eye 
You must be such a fool 
To pass me by

 

THE LOOP

I just wanna say 
I haven't been away 
I'm still right here 
Where I always was 
So one day, if you're bored 
By all means call 
Because you can do 
(But only if you want to) 
I just wanna say 
I haven't been away 
I am still right here 
Where I always was 
So one day, when you're bored 
By all means call 
Because you can do 
But you might not get through

 

SISTER I'M A POET

All over this town 
Yes, a low wind may blow 
And I can see through everybo... 
With no reason 
To hide these words I feel 
And no reason 
To talk about the books I read 
But still I do 
That's 'cause I'm a ... Sister I'm a ... 
All over this town 
Along this way 
Outside the prison gates 
I love the romance of crime 
And I wonder 
Does anybody feel the way I do ? 
And is evil just something you are 
Or something you do ? 
Sister I'm a ... Sister I'm a ... 
All over this town, All over this town 
They pull over 
In their Citroen vans 
Not to shake your hand 
With meths on their breaths 
And you with youth on your side 
A plastic bag stranded at the lights 
This once was me ...
But now I'm a ... Sister I'm a ...
All over this town ... Oh, oh, oh 
All over this town, All over this town, Oh ... 
I still cannot speak French ... I am very lazy

 

JACK THE RIPPER

Oh, you look so tired 
Mouth slack and wide 
Ill-housed and ill-advised 
Your face is as mean 
As your life has been 
Crash into my arms 
I WANT YOU 
You don't agree -
But you don't refuse 
I know you 
And I know a place 
Where no one is likely to pass 
Oh, you don't care if it's late 
And you don't care if you're lost 
And oh, you look so tired 
(But tonight you presumed too much) 
Too much, too much 
And if it's the last 
Thing I ever do 
I'M GONNA GET YOU 
Crash into my arms 
I WANT YOU 
You don't agree -
But you don't refuse 
I know you 
And no one knows a thing about my life 
I can come and go as I please 
And if I want to, I can stay 
Oh, or if I want to, I can leave 
Nobody knows me, Nobody knows me, Nobody knows me Oh, oh...

 

SUCH A LITTLE THING MAKES SUCH A BIG DIFFERENCE

Such a little thing, such a little thing
but the difference it made was grave
there you go
wielding a bicycle chain
oh why won't you change
cange and be nicer?
such a little thing
a gentle tone of kindness
or written words on paper
- can you write?
How I love all of
the very simple things of life
(God's good air)
how I love all of
the very simple things of life
such a little thing
a fumbling politeness
the difference it saved me
wielding a bicycle chain
"I WILL NOT CHANGE AND I WILL NOT BE NICE"
Most people keep their brains between your legs (don't you find?)
Leave me alone - I was only singing, leave me alone because
I was only singing
leave me alone - I was only singing, leave me alone
you have just proved (again)
MOST PEOPLE KEEP THEIR BRAINS BETWEEN THEIR LEGS

 

I KNOW IT'S GONNA HAPPEN SOMEDAY

My love, wherever you are 
Whatever you are 
Don't lose faith 
I know it's gonna happen someday 
To you 
Please wait ... 
Please wait ... 
Oh ... Wait ... 
Don't lose faith 
You say that the day just never arrives 
And it's never seemed so far away 
Still, I know it's gonna happen someday 
To you 
Please wait ... 
Don't lose faith

 

WE'LL LET YOU KNOW

How sad are we ? 
And how sad have we been ? 
We'll let you know, We'll let you know 
Oh, but only if - you're really interested 
You wonder how 
We've stayed alive 'till now 
We'll let you know, We'll let you know 
But only if - you're really interested 
We're all smiles 
Then, honest, I swear, it's the turnstiles 
That make us hostile 
Oh ... We will descend 
On anyone unable to defend 
Themselves 
Oh ... And the songs we sing 
They're not supposed to mean a thing 
La, la, la, la ... Oh ...
You're lonely, Oh ... you're lonely 
Oh ... 
GET OFF THE ROOF !
Oh ... Your Arsenal !
We may seem cold, or 
We may even be 
The most depressing people you've ever known 
At heart, what's left, we sadly know 
That we are the last truly British people you'll ever know 
We are the last truly British people you will ever know 
You'll never never want to know

 

SUEDHEAD

Why do you come here
why do you hang around
I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry
Why do you come here
when you know it makes
things hard for me
when you know, oh
why do you come?
Why do you telephone?
and why send me silly notes?
I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry
why do you come here
when you know it makes
thing hard for me
when you know, oh
why do you come?
You had to sneak into my room
'just' to read my diary
was it just to see all the things
you knew I'd written about you?
and...so many illustrations
I'm so very sickened
oh, I am so sickened NOW

 

HE KNOWS I'D LOVE TO SEE HIM

He Knows (he knows)
Or, I think he does
because when I lived
in the Arse of the world...
he knows, he knows, he knows I'd love
to see him happy (or as close as is allowed)
because when I lived
in the Arse of the world
he knows, he knows, he knows I'd love
to see him happy (or as close as possible
as close as possible, as close as is allowed)
My name still conjours up deadly deeds
and a bad taste in the mouth
the police - they actually knew me
they said:
"You're just another person in the world
you're just another fool with radical views
you're just another who has maddening views
you want to turn it on its head
by staying in bed!"
I said: "I know I do"

 

YOU'RE GONNA NEED SOMEONE ON YOUR SIDE

With the world's fate 
Resting on your shoulder 
You're gonna need 
Someone on your side 
You can't do it by yourself 
Any longer 
You're gonna need 
Someone on your side 
Someone kindly told me 
That you'd wasted 
Eight of nine lives
Oh, give yourself a break 
Before you break down 
You're gonna need someone on your side 
And here I am, And here I am 
Well, you don't need 
To look so pleased ! 
Day or night, 
There is no difference 
You're gonna need someone on your side 
Day or night, 
There is no difference 
You're gonna need someone soon 
And here I am, And here I am 
Well, you don't need 
To look so pleased

 

GLAMOROUS GLUE

First day with the jar 
You find 
Everyone lies 
First day with the jar 
You find 
Everyone lies, nobody minds, Everyone lies 
Where is the man you respect ? 
And where is the woman you love ? 
Where's the woman you love ? 
Third week with the jar
You find 
Everything dies 
We won't vote Conservative 
Because we never have 
Everyone lies, everyone lies 
Where is the man you respect ? 
And where is the woman you love ? 
Where's the woman you love ? 
Everything of worth 
On Earth, Is there, To share 
I used to dream, and I used to vow 
I wouldn't dream of it now 
We look to Los Angeles 
For the language we use 
London is dead, London is dead, London is dead, ...
Now I'm too much in love 
I'm too much in love, 
I know I'll go 
Empty hand 
From the land

 

WE HATE IT WHEN OUR FRIENDS BECOME SUCCESSFUL

We hate it when our friends become successful 
We hate it when our friends become successful 
Oh, look at those clothes 
Now look at that face, it's so old 
And such a video ! 
Well, it's really laughable 
Ha, ha, ha ...
We hate it when our friends become successful 
And if they're Northern, that makes it even worse
And if we can destroy them 
You bet your life we will 
Destroy them 
If we can hurt them 
Well, we may as well ... 
It's really laughable 
Ha, ha, ha ... 
You see, it should've been me 
It could've been me 
Everybody knows 
Everybody says so 
They say : 
"Ah, you have loads of songs 
So many songs 
More songs than they'd stand 
Verse 
Chorus 
Middle eight 
Break, fade 
Just listen ..."
La, la-la, la-la

 

NOW MY HEART IS FULL

There's gonna be some trouble 
A whole house will need re-building 
And everyone I love in the house 
Will recline on an analyst's couch quite 
Soon 
Your Father cracks a joke 
And in the usual way 
Empties the room 
Tell all of my friends 
(I don't have too many 
Just some rain-coated lovers' puny brothers)
Dallow, Spicer, Pinkie, Cubitt 
Rush to danger 
Wind up nowhere 
Patric Doonan - raised to wait 
I'm tired again, I've tried again, and 
Now my heart is full 
Now my heart is full 
And I just can't explain 
So I won't even try to
Dallow, Spicer, Pinkie, Cubitt 
Every jammy Stressford poet 
Loafing oafs in all-night chemists 
Loafing oafs in all-night chemists 
Underact - express depression 
Ah, but Bunnie I loved you 
I was tired again 
I've tried again, and 
Now my heart is full 
Now my heart is full 
And I just can't explain 
So I won't even try to 
Could you pass by ? 
Could you pass by ? 
Oh ... 
Now my heart is full 
Now my heart is full 
And I just can't explain 
So ... slow ... 
Slow ... slow ... slow ... slow ... slow ...

 

SPRING-HEELED JIM

Spring-heeled Jim winks an eye 
He'll "do", he'll never be "done to" 
He takes on whoever flew through 
"Well, it's the normal thing to do" ... ah ... 
Spring-heeled Jim lives to love 
Now kissing with his mouth full 
And his eyes on some other fool 
So many women 
His head should be spinning 
Ah, but no ! 
Ah, but no ! 
But no !
Ah, no !
Spring-heeled Jim slurs the words : 
"There's no need to be so knowing
Take life at five times the 
Average speed, like I do" 
Until Jim feels the chill 
"Oh, where did all the time go ?" 
Once always in for the kill 
Now it's too cold 
And he feels too 
old 
Too old
Mmm, old... 
La, la, la, la-la, la ...

 

BILLY BUDD

Say, Billy Budd 
So you think you should ? 
Oh, everyone's laughing 
Say, Billy Budd 
So you think that you should ? 
Everyone's laughing ! 
Since I took up with you 
Things have been bad 
Yeah, but now it's 12 years on 
Now it's 12 years on 
Yes, and I took up with you 
I took my job application 
Into town 
Did you hear ? They turned me down 
Yes, and it's all because of us 
Oh, and what was in our eyes 
Oh, what was in our eyes, yeah 
I said, Billy Budd 
I would happily lose 
Both of my legs 
I would lose both of my legs 
Oh, if it meant you could be free 
Oh, if it meant you could be free 
(Don't leave us in the dark!)

 

HOLD ON TO YOUR FRIENDS

A bond of trust 
Has been abused 
Something of value 
May be lost 
Give up your job 
Squander your cash - be rash 
Just hold on to your friends 
There are more than enough 
To fight and oppose 
Why waste good time 
Fighting the people you like 
Who will fall defending your name 
Oh, don't feel so ashamed 
To have friends 
But now you only call me 
When you're feeling depressed 
When you feel happy I'm 
So far from your mind 
My patience is stretched 
My loyalty vexed 
Oh, you're losing all of your friends 
Hold on to your friends 
Hold on to your friends 
Resist - or move on 
Be mad, be rash 
Smoke and explode 
Sell all of your clothes 
Just bear in mind : 
Oh, there just might come a time 
When you need some friends

 

THE MORE YOU IGNORE ME, THE CLOSER I GET

The more you ignore me 
The closer I get 
You're wasting your time 
The more you ignore me 
The closer I get 
You're wasting your time 
I will be 
In the bar 
With my head 
On the bar 
I am now 
A central part 
Of your mind's landscape 
Whether you care 
Or do not 
Yeah, I've made up your mind 
The more you ignore me 
The closer I get 
You're wasting your time 
The more you ignore me 
The closer I get 
You're wasting your time 
Beware !
I bear more grudges 
Than lonely high court judges 
When you sleep 
I will creep 
Into your thoughts 
Like a bad debt 
That you can't pay 
Take the easy way 
And give in 
Yeah, and let me in 
Oh, let me in 
Oh let me ... 
Oh, let me in 
IT'S WAR 
IT'S WAR 
WAR 
WAR 
Oh, let me in 
Ah, the closer I get 
Ah, you're asking for it 
Ah, the closer I get 
Ooh, the closer I ...

 

WHY DON'T YOU FIND OUT FOR YOURSELF

The sanest days are mad 
Why don't you find out for yourself ? 
Then you'll see the price 
Very closely 
Some men here 
They have a special interest 
In your career 
They wanna help you to grow 
And then syphon all your dough 
Why don't you find out for yourself ? 
Then you'll see the glass 
Hidden in the grass 
You'll never believe me, so 
Why don't you find out for yourself ? 
Sick down to my heart 
That's just the way it goes 
Some men here 
They know the full extent of 
Your distress 
They kneel and pray 
And they say : 
"Long may it last" 
Why don't you find out for yourself ?
Then you'll see the glass 
Hidden in the grass 
Bad scenes come and go 
For which you must allow 
Sick down to my heart 
That's just the way it goes 
Don't rake up my mistakes 
I know exactly what they are 
And ... what do YOU do ? 
Well ... you just SIT THERE 
I've been stabbed in the back 
So many many times 
I don't have any skin 
But that's just the way it goes

 

I AM HATED FOR LOVING

I am hated for loving 
I am hated for loving 
Anonymous call, a poison pen 
A brick in the small of the back again 
I still don't belong 
To anyone - I am mine 
And I am hated for loving 
I am haunted for wanting 
Anonymous call, a poison pen 
A brick in the ... ah ... 
A brick in the small of the back again 
I still don't belong 
To anyone - I am mine 
I am falling 
With no-one to catch me 
I am falling 
And there's still 
No-one to catch me 
Ah .. 
Anonymous call, a poison pen 
A brick in the ... ah ... 
A brick in the small of the back again 
I just don't belong 
To anywhere 
I just don't belong 
Mmm ... 
Ah ...

 

LIFEGUARD SLEEPING, GIRL DROWNING

Always looking for attention 
Always needs to be mentioned 
Who does she 
Think she should be ? 
The shrill cry through darkening air 
Doesn't she know he's 
Had such a busy day ? 
Tell her ... sshhh
Somebody tell her ... sshhh 
Slowest ... 
It was only a test 
But she swam too far 
Against the tide 
She deserves all she gets 
The sky became marked with stars 
As an out-stretched arm slowly 
Disappears 
Hooray 
Oh hooray 
No, oh, oh, woh, there's no movement 
No, oh, hooray 
Oh, hooray 
Please don't worry 
There'll be no fuss 
She was ... nobody's nothing 
(What's your name ?) 
When he awoke 
The sea was calm 
And another day passes like a dream 
There's no ... no way 
(What's your name ?)

 

USED TO BE A SWEET BOY

Used to be a sweet boy 
Holding so tightly 
To Daddy's hand 
But that was all 
In some distant land 
Blazer and tie 
And a big bright healthy smile 
Used to make all 
Of our trials worthwhile 
Used to be a sweet boy 
And I'm not to blame 
Something went wrong 
And I know 
I'm not to blame 
Something went wrong 
Can't be to blame 
Ah ...

 

THE LAZY SUNBATHERS

A world war 
Was announced 
Days ago 
But they didn't know 
The lazy sunbathers 
The lazy sunbathers 
The sun burns through 
To the planet's core 
And it isn't enough 
They want more 
Nothing 
Appears 
To be 
Between the ears of 
The lazy sunbathers 
Too jaded 
To question stagnation 
The sun burns through 
To the planet's core 
And it isn't enough 
They want more 
Religions fall 
Children shelled 
"...Children shelled ? That's all 
Very well, but would you 
Please keep the noise 
Down low ? 
Because you're waking 
The lazy sunbathers ..."
Oh, the lazy sunbathers 
The lazy sunbathers

 

SPEEDWAY

And when you slam 
Down the hammer 
Can you see it in your heart ? 
All of the rumours 
Keeping me grounded 
I never said, I never said that they were 
Completely unfounded 
So when you slam 
Down the hammer 
Can you see it in your heart ? 
Can you delve so low ? 
And when you're standing 
On my fingers 
Can you see it in your heart ? ... ah ... 
And when you try 
To break my spirit 
It won't work 
Because there's nothing left to break 
Anymore 
All of the rumours 
Keeping me grounded 
I never said, I never said that they were 
Completely unfounded 
You won't sleep 
Until the earth that wants me 
Finally has me 
Oh you've done it now 
You won't rest 
Until the hearse that becomes me 
Finally takes me 
Oh you've done it now 
And you won't smile 
Until my loving mouth 
Is shut good and proper 
FOREVER 
All of the rumours 
Keeping me grounded 
I never said, I never said that they were 
Completely unfounded 
And all those lies 
Written lies, twisted lies 
Well, they weren't lies 
They weren't lies 
They weren't lies 
I never said 
I never said 
I could have mentioned your name 
I could have dragged you in 
Guilt by implication 
By association 
I've always been true to you 
In my own strange way 
I've always been true to you 
In my own sick way 
I'll always stay true to you

 

THE TEACHERS ARE AFRAID OF THE PUPILS

There's too many people 
Planning your downfall 
When your spirit's on trial 
These nights can be frightening 
Sleep transports sadness 
To some other mid-brain 
And somebody here 
Will not be here next year 
So you stand by the board 
Full of fear and intention 
And, if you think that they're listening 
Well, you've got to be joking 
Oh, you understand change 
And you think it's essential 
But when your profession 
Is humiliation 
Say the wrong word to our children ...
We'll have you, oh yes, we'll have you 
Lay a hand on our children 
And it's never too late to have you 
Mucus on your collar 
A nail up through the staff chair 
A blade in your soap 
And you cry into your pillow 
To be finished would be a relief 
To be finished would be a relief... 
Say the wrong word to our children ...
We'll have you, oh yes, we'll have you 
Lay a hand on our children 
And it's never too late to have you 
To be finished would be a relief 
To be finished would be a relief...
I'm very glad this thing has come 
Sometimes I'm so glad 
Never bother to play the tunes 
I've seen it coming for dear life

 

READER MEET AUTHOR

You don't know a thing about their lives 
They live where you wouldn't dare to drive
You shake as you think of how they sleep 
But you write as if you are my side-by-side 
Reader, meet Author 
With the hope of hearing sense 
But you may be feeling let down 
By the words of defence 
He says : "No-one ever sees me when I cry"
You don't know a thing about their lives 
Books don't save them, books aren't Stanley knives 
And if a fight broke out here tonight 
You'd be the first away, because you're that type 
And the Year 2000 won't change anyone here 
As each fabled promise flies so fast 
You'll swear it was never there 
Oh, have you ever escaped from a shipwrecked life ? 
So safely with your software; all miles from the front line 
You hear the way their sad voices, and you start to imagine things 
Oh, any excuse to write more lies

 

THE BOY RACER

He's just too good-natured and

THE OPERATION

You fight with your right hand 
And caress with your left hand 
Everyone I know is sick to death of you 
With a tear that's a mile wide 
In the kite that you're flying 
Everyone I know is sick to death of you 
Ever since 
You don't look the same 
You're just not the same, no way 
You say clever things and 
You never used to 
You don't catch what I'm saying 
When you're deafened to advice 
Everyone here is sick to the 
Back teeth of you 
With a tear that's a mile wide 
In the kite that you're flying 
Everyone here is sick to the 
Tattoo of you 
Ever since 
You don't look the same 
You're just not the same, no way 
You say pleasant things and 
There is no need to
Still, you fight with your right hand 
And caress with your left hand 
Ooh, ooh ... Sad to say ... 
How once I was in love with you 
Sad to say ... 
You don't catch what I'm saying 
When you're deafened to advice 
Ooh, ooh ... Ever since 
You don't look the same 
You're just not the same, no way 
What the hell have 
They stuck into you ?

 

DAGENHAM DAVE

Head in the clouds, and a mouthful of pie 
Head in a blouse, everybody loves him 
I see why 
Dagenham Dave, Dagenham Dave, Oh, Dagenham Dave 
Dagenham Dave, Dagenham Dave, Oh, Dagenham Dave 
"I love Karen, I love Sharon" on the windowscreen 
With never the need to fight or to question a single thing 
Dagenham Dave, Dagenham Dave Oh, Dagenham Dave 
Dagenham Dave, Dagenham Dave Oh, Dagenham Dave ...
He'd love to touch, he's afraid that he might self-combust 
I could say more, but you get the general idea

Oh, Dave, oh, Dagenham, dagenham, Oh, Dave, oh, Dave, ...

 

DO YOUR BEST AND DON'T WORRY

Compare the best of their days 
With the worst of your days 
You won't win 
With your standards so high 
And your spirits so low 
At least remember ... 
This is you on a bad day, you on a pale day 
Just do your best and don't ... Don't worry, oh 
The way you hang yourself is oh, so unfair 
See the best of how they look 
Against the worst of how you are
And again, you won't win 
With your standards so high 
And your spirits so low 
At least remember ... 
This is you on a drab day, you in a drab dress 
Just do your best and don't ... Don't worry, oh 
The way you hang yourself is oh, so unfair 
Just do your best and don't ... Don't worry, oh 
The way you watch yourself is oh, so unfair 
Just do your best and don't ... Don't worry, oh 
Do your best and don't ...

SOUTHPAW

You were a boy before you became a man 
I don't see the joy 
And you ran with your pals in the sun 
You turned around and they were gone 
Again ... 
A sick boy should be treated 
So easily defeated 
Oh, I just don't understand 
So you ran with your pals in the sun 
You turned around 
You were alone 
Again ... 
And you ran back to Ma 
Which set the pace for the rest of your days 
Oh, you ran back to Ma 
Which set the pace for the rest of your days 
Oh, you ran back to Ma 
Which set the pace for the rest of your days 
And now, there is something that you should know 
There is something that you should know 
The girl of your dreams is 
Here all alone 
Girl of your dreams is 
Here all alone 
The girl of your dreams is 
Sad and all alone 
The girl of your dreams is 
Here all alone 
There is something that you should know 
There is something that you should know 
Girl of your dreams is 
Here all alone 
The girl of your dreams is 
Sad and is all alone 
The girl of your dreams is 
Sad and is feeling all alone 
Oh, there is something that you should know 
Help me, help me, help me ...

 

MALADJUSTED

I wanna start from 
Before the beginning 
Loot wine, "Be mine, and 
Then let's stay out for the night"
Ride via Parkside 
Semi-perilous lives 
Jeer the lights in the windows 
Of all safe and stable homes 
(But wondering then, well what 
Could peace of mind be like ?)
Anyway do you want to hear 
Our story, or not ? 
As the Fulham Road lights 
Stretch and invite into the night 
From a Stevenage overspill 
We'd kill to live around 
SW6 - with someone like you 
Keep thieves' hours 
With someone like you 
...As long as it slides 
You stalk the house 
In a low-cut blouse : 
"Oh Christ, another stifled 
Friday night !"
And the Fulham Road lights 
Stretch and invite into the night 
Well, I was fifteen 
What could I know ?
When the gulf between 
All the things I need 
And the things I receive 
Is an ancient ocean 
Wide, wild, lost, uncrossed 
Still I maintain there's nothing 
Wrong with you 
You do all that you do 
Because it's all you can do 
Well, I was fifteen 
Where could I go ?
With a soul full of loathing 
For stinging bureaucracy 
Making it anything 
Other than easy 
For working girls like me 
With my hands on my head 
I flop on your bed 
With a head full of dread 
For all I've ever said 
Maladjusted, maladjusted 
Maladjusted maladjusted 
Never to be trusted 
Oh, never to be trusted 
There's nothing wrong with you, oh 
...There's nothing wrong with you

 

ALMA MATTERS

So : the choice I have made 
May seem strange to you 
But who asked you, anyway ? 
It's my life to wreck 
My own way 
You see : to someone, somewhere, oh yeah ... 
Alma matters 
In mind, body and soul 
In part, and in whole 
Because to someone, somewhere, oh yeah ... 
Alma matters 
In mind, body and soul 
In part, and in whole 
So the life I have made 
May seem wrong to you 
But, I've never been surer 
It's my life to ruin 
My own way 
You see : to someone, somewhere, oh yeah ... 
Alma matters 
In mind, body and soul 
In part, and in whole 
Because to someone, somewhere, oh yeah ... 
Alma matters 
In mind, body and soul 
In part, and in whole 
To someone, somewhere, oh yeah ... 
Alma matters 
In mind, body and soul 
Part, and in whole 
So to someone, somewhere, oh yeah ... 
Alma matters 
In mind, body and soul 
Part, and in whole 
To someone, somewhere, oh yeah ... 
Oh yeah ... Oh yeah, oh yeah Oh yeah ...

 

AMBITIOUS OUTSIDERS

Bolt-lock your doors 
Alarm your cars 
And still we move in closer 
Every day 
Top of the list 
Is your smiling kids 
But we'll be smiling too 
So that's OK 
Oh, and by the way 
Thank you, because you're 
Giving, giving, giving 
And we're receiving - 
No, no, we're taking 
Keeping the population down 
Your taxes paid, but 
Police waylaid 
And we knows 
When the school bus 
Comes and goes 
We're on your street, but 
You don't see us 
Or, if you do 
You smile and say Hello 
BUT DON'T UNDERESTIMATE US 
When you are 
Giving, giving, giving 
And we're receiving - 
No, no, we're taking 
Just keeping 
The population down 
You're giving, giving, giving 
Well, it's your own fault 
For reproducing 
We're just keeping 
The population down

 

TROUBLE LOVES ME

Trouble loves me 
Trouble needs me 
Two things 
More than you do 
Or would attempt to 
So, console me 
Otherwise, hold me 
Just when it seems like 
Everything's evened out 
And the balance 
Seems serene 
Trouble loves me 
Walks beside me 
To chide me 
Not to guide me 
It's still much more 
Than you'll do 
So, console me 
Otherwise, hold me 
Just when it seems like 
Everything's evened out 
And the balance seems serene 
See the fool I'll be 
Still running 'round 
On the flesh rampage 
Still running 'round 
Ready with ready-wit 
Still running 'round 
On the flesh rampage 
- At your age ! 
Go to Soho, oh 
Go to waste in 
The wrong arms 
Still running 'round 
Trouble loves me 
Seeks and finds me 
To charlatanize me 
Which is only 
As it should be 
Oh, please fulfill me 
Otherwise, kill me 
Show me a barrel and watch me scrape it 
Faced with the music, as always I'll face it 
In the half-light 
So English, frowning 
Then at midnight I 
Can't get you out of my head 
A disenchanted taste 
Still running 'round 
A disenchanted taste 
Still running 'round

 

PAPA JACK

Papa Jack 
Wants to turn 
Back the clock 
And reach out 
To the kids 
He once had 
Who have flown 
Papa Jack 
In decline 
Feels inclined 
To reach out 
To the kids 
He once had 
Who have flown 
But there was a time 
When the kids reached up 
And Papa Jack just 
Pushed them away 
Looking deep 
In his heart 
Papa Jack 
Doesn't like 
What he sees 
Or the time 
On his hands 
The dying day 
The chilly sun 
Papa Jack 
All alone 
Sings slow 
Grieving and low 
But there was a time 
When the kids reached up 
Now you can't always 
Have it your way 
Papa Jack 
Ah ...

 

AMMUNITION

I know these roads 
Each ridge 
And narrow bridge 
Each cheveron 
Enticing me on 
Each warning sign 
I take in my stride 
I don't need more ammunition 
I've got more than I can spend 
I don't dwell on things I'm missing 
I'm just pleased 
With the things I've found 
I know these roads 
An old hand understands 
Above all, I know what's 
Expected of me now 
Veering cliffwards 
I don't need more ammunition 
I've got more than I can spend 
I don't dwell on things I'm missing 
I'm just pleased 
With the things I've found 
With the things I've found 
With the things I've found 
I've found 
I've been crying 
It comes back on these salient days 
And it stays 
And it says : 
"We've never really been away" 
I don't need more ammunition 
I've got more than I can spend 
I don't think of who I'm missing 
I've got no space and no time 
In my life, anymore 
No space or time 
In my life, anymore 
For Revenge

 

WIDE TO RECEIVE

Download something 
Useful, or useless 
Because I'm lying here 
Wide to receive 
Almost anything 
You'd care to give 
And I don't 
Get along with myself 
And I'm not too keen 
On anyone else 
Turn on, plug in 
Then just walk away 
Unlock, process 
And then just go 
And I've never felt quite so alone 
As I do right now 
I'm lying here 
Wide to receive 
Almost anything 
You'd care to leave 
Wide, wide, wide Wide, wide, wide...

 

ROY'S KEEN

(GO ON !)
He's romancing you 
And chancing his arm 
He'll be here 
Smiling on time 
He's romancing you 
And chancing his arm 
He'll be here 
Smiling on time 
Roy's keen oh Roy's keen 
Roy's keen oh Roy's keen 
We've never seen a 
Keener window-cleaner 
Back up the ladder 
Into each corner 
Dunking the chamois 
Just think of the goodwill 
The ladder's a planet 
Roy is a star, and 
I am a satellite 
(But that's alright) 
He can hold a smile for as long 
As you require (even longer) 
He can hold a smile for as long 
As you require (even longer) 
Roy's keen oh Roy's keen 
Roy's keen oh Roy's keen 
We've never seen a 
Keener window-cleaner 
Back up the ladder 
Into each corner 
Dunking the chamois 
Just think of the goodwill 
The ladder's a planet 
Roy is a star, and 
I am a satellite 
I will be set alight 
Don't say you'll hold it steady 
Then you let it go 
Don't say you'll hold it steady 
Then you let it go Oh ...
You're up the ladder 
Into each corner 
Foot in a bucket 
We trust you to wreck it 
Even when it's under your nose 
Well, you just can't 
See it, can you ? 
Well, it's here 
Right under your nose 
And you just can't 
See it, can you? La la la la ...
Roy's keen, Roy's keen La la la la ...
We've never seen a 
Keener window-cleaner 
Oh ... La la la la ...

 

HE CRIED

I need you 
Simple words 
But words which had never been heard 
By the soul 
Stoned to death 
But still living 
And so he froze where he stood 
And he looked to the ground 
And he cried 
He cried 
Ride our minds 
If you must 
But there's always a line you don't cross 
Time is short 
Don't be cruel 
Oh you don't know the power 
In what you're saying 
Oh ... 
And so he froze where he stood 
And he looked to the ground 
And he cried 
He cried 
People where 
I come from 
They survive without feelings or blood 
I never could 
Was stoned to death 
But I'm still living 
So he froze where he stood 
And he looked to the ground 
And he cried 
He cried 
So he froze 
And he looked, and he looked 
To the ground 
And he cried 
He cried

 

SORROW WILL COME IN THE END

Legalized theft 
Leaves me bereft 
I get it straight in the neck 
(Somehow expecting no less) 
A court of justice 
With no use for Truth 
Lawyer ...liar 
Lawyer ...liar 
You pleaded and squealed 
And you think you've won 
But Sorrow will come 
To you in the end 
And as sure as my words are pure 
I praise the day that brings you pain 
Q.C.'s obsessed with sleaze 
Frantic for Fame 
They're all on the game 
They just use a different name 
You lied 
And you were believed 
By a J.P. senile and vile 
You pleaded and squealed 
And you think you've won 
But Sorrow will come 
To you in the end 
And as sure as my words are pure 
I praise the day that brings you pain 
So don't close your eyes 
Don't close your eyes 
A man who slits throats 
Has time on his hands 
And I'm gonna get you 
So don't close your eyes 
Don't ever close your eyes 
You think you've won 
OH NO

 

SATAN REJECTED MY SOUL

Satan rejected my soul 
He knows my kind 
He won't be dragged down 
He's seen my face around 
He knows Heaven doesn't seem 
To be my home 
So I must find 
Somewhere else to go 
So I must find 
Somewhere else to go 
So, take it - please 
It's free 
You'll never see 
You'll never see 
All the fun in life it's cost me 
Satan rejected my soul 
As low as he goes 
He never quite goes this low 
He's seen my face around 
He knows Heaven doesn't seem 
To be my home 
So I must find 
Somewhere else to go 
So I must find 
Somewhere else to go 
So, take it please 
It's really sly 
Come on, come on, ah Come on, come on, come on 
Take it please, It's really sly 
Come on, come on, ah Come on, come on, come on 
Call me in, Pull me in, call me in 
Come on, come on, oh Come on, come on, come on 
Pull me in, pull me in, Call me in, haul me in, pull me in 
Come on, come on, ah, Come on, come on 
La la la la la, Oh ...

 
 REEL AROUND THE FOUNTAIN

It's time the tale was told
of how you took a child
and you made him old
Reel around the fountain
slap me on the patio
I'll take it now
Fifteen minutes with you
well, I wouldn't say no
people said that you were virtually dead
and they were so wrong
fifteen minutes with you
well, i wouldn't say no
people said that you were easily led
and they were half-right
I dreamt about you last night
and i fell out of bed twice
you can pin and mount me like a butterfly
but take me to the haven of your bed
was something that you never said
two lumps, please
you're the bee's knees
but so am I
Meet me at the fountain
shove me on the patio
I'll take it slowly
Fifteen minutes with you
oh I wouldn't say no
people see no worth in you
oh but I do

 

YOU'VE GOT EVERYTHING NOW

As merry as the days were long
I was right and you were wrong
back at the old grey school
I would win and you would lose
But you've got everything now
and what a terrible mess I've made of my life
No, I've never had a job
because I've never wanted one
I've seen you smile
but I've never really heard you laugh
So who is rich and who is poor?
I cannot say...
You are your mother's only son
and you're a desperate one
But I don't want a lover
I just want to be seen in the back of your car
A friendship sadly lost?
Well, this is true ...and yet, it's false
Did I ever tell you , by the way
I never did like your face
But you've got everything now
and what a terrible mess I've made of my life
No, I've never had a job
because I'm too shy
But I don't want a lover
I just want to be tied to the back of your car.

 

MISERABLE LIE

So, goodbye
please stay with your own kind
and I'll stay with mine
There's something against us
it's not time
So, goodbye
I know I hardly say
how much I love your casual way
but please put your tongue away
a little higher and we're well away
the dark nights are drawing in
and your humour is as black as them
I look at yours, you laugh at mine
and"love" is just a miserable lie
you have destroyed my flower like-life
not once-but twice
you have corrupt my innocent mind
not once-but twice
I know that wind-swept mystical air
it means: I'd like to see your underwear
I recognise that mystical air
it means: I'd like to see your underwear
what do we get for the trouble and pain?
just a rented room in Whalley Range
into the depths of the criminal world
I followed her...
I need advice, I need advice
because nobody ever looks at me twice
I'm just a country-mile behind
the world
I'm just a country mile behind
the whole world
so take me when you go

 

PRETTY GIRLS MAKE GRAVES

Upon the sand,upon the bay
"there is a quick and easy way" you say
before you illustrate
I'd rather state:
"I'm not the man you think I am
I'm not the man you think I am "
And Sorrow's native son
he will not smile for anyone
And pretty girls makes the graves
End of the pier, end of the bay
you tug my arm and say:"Give into lust,
give up to lust, oh heaven knows we'll
soon be dust..."
But I'm not the man you think I am
I'm not the man you think I am
And Sorrow's native son
he will not rise for anyone
And pretty girls make graves
I could have been wild and I could have been free
but Nature played this trick on me
She wants it Now
and she will not wait
but she's too rough
and I'm too delicate
Then on the sand
another man, he takes her hand
and a smile lights up her stupid face
(and well, it would)
I lost my faith in Womanhood
I lost my faith in Womanhood, I lost my faith

 

THE HAND THAT ROCKS THE CRADLE

Please don't cry
the ghost and the storm outside
will not invade this sacred shire
nor infiltrate your mind
my life down I shall lie
if the bogey-man should try
to play tricks on your sacred mind
to tease, torment and tantalise
wavering shadows loom
a piano plays in an empty room
there'll be blood on the cleaver tonight
when darkness lifts and the room is bright
I'll still be by your side
for you are all that matters
and I'll love you till the day I die
there never need to be longing in your eyes
as long as the hand that rocks the cradle is mine
ceiling shadows shimmy by
and when the wardrobe towers like a beast of prey
there's a sadness in your beautiful eyes
you're untouched, unsoiled, wonderous eyes
my life down I shall lie
should restless spirts try
to play tricks on you sacred mind
but whom I never gave a name
I just looked into his wonderous eyes
and said" never never never again"
all too soon I did return
just like a moth to a flame
so rattle my bones all over the stones
because I'm only a beggar-man whom nobody owns
see how words as old as sin
fit me like a glove I'm here and here I'll stay
together we lie, together we pray
there never need be longing in your eyes
as long as the hand that rocks the cradle is mine

 

STILL ILL

I decree today that life
is simply taking and not giving
England is mine and it owes me a living
ask me why, and I'll spit in your eye
ask me why, and I'll spit in your eye
but we cannot cling to the old dreams anymore
no, we cannot cling to the old dreams anymore
Does the body rule the mind
or does the mind rule the body?
I dunno...
Under the iron bridge we kissed
and although I ended up with sore lips
it just wasn't like the old days anymore
no, it wasn't like those days
am I still ill?
Does the body rule the mind
or does the mind rule the body ?
I dunno...
Ask me why, and I'll die
ask me why, and I'll die
and if you must go to work tomorrow
well, if I were you I wouldn't bother
for there are brighter sides to life
and I should know because I've seen them
but not very often...
under the iron bridge we kissed
and although I ended up with sore lips
it just wasn't like the old days anymore
no, it wasn't like those days
am I still ill?

 

HAND IN GLOVE

Hand in glove
the sun shines out of our behinds
no, it's not like any other love
this one is different-because it's us
Hand in glove
we can go wherever we please
and everything depends upon
how near you stand to me
And if the people stare
then the people stare
I really don't know and I really don't care
Hand in glove
the Good People laugh
yes, we may be hidden by rags
but we have something they'll never have
So, hand in glove I stake my claim
I'll fight to the last breath
If they dare touch a hair on your head
I'll fight to the last breath
The Good Life is out there, somewhere
so stay on my arm, you little charmer
But I know my luck too well
and I'll probably never see you again.

 

WHAT DIFFERENCE DOES IT MAKE?

All men have secrets and here is mine
so let it be known
we have been through hell and high tide,
I can surely rely on you?
and yet you start to recoil,
heavy words are so lightly thrown
but still I'd leap in front of a flying bullet for you
So, what difference does it make?
so, what difference does it make?
it makes none
but you have gone
and you must be looking very old tonight
The devil will find work for idle hands to do
I stole and I lied, and why?
because you asked me to!
but now you make feel so ashamed
because I've only got two hands
well, I'm still fond of you
So, what difference does it make?
so, what difference does it make?
it makes none
but you have gone
and your prejudice won't keep you warm tonight
So, no more apologies
no more apologies
I'm too tired
I'm too sick and tired
and I'm feeling very sick and ill today
But I'm still fond of you

 

I DON'T OWE YOU ANYTHING

Bought on stolen wine
a nod was the first step
you know very well
what was coming next
did I really walk all this way
just to hear you say
"oh I don't want to go out tonight"
but you will
for you must
I don't owe you anything
but you owe me something
repay me now
you should never go to them
let them come to you
just like I do
you should not go to them
let them come to you
just like I do
Too freely on your lips
words prematurely said
oh but I know what will make you smile tonight
Life is never kind
life is never kind
oh but I know what will make you smile tonight

 

SUFFER LITTLE CHILDREN

Over the moors,take me to the moors
dig a shallow grave
and I'll lay me down
Lesley-Anne, with your pretty white beads
oh John, you'll never be a man
and you'll never see your home again
oh Manchester, so much to answer for
Edward, see those alluring lights?
tonight will be your very last night
a woman said "I know my son is dead
I'll never rest my hands on his scared head"
Hindley wakes and Hindley says:
"Wherever he has gone, I have gone "
But fresh lilaced moorland fields
cannot hide the stoild stench of death
Hindley wakes and Hindley says:
"Whatever he has done, I have done"
But this is no easy ride
for a child cries
"find me...find me, nothing more
we're on a sullen misty moor
we may be dead and we may be gone
but we will be right by your side
until the day you die
this is no easy ride
we will haunt you when you laugh
yes, you could say we're a team
you might sleep
BUT YOU WILL NEVER DREAM!"
Oh Manchester, so much to answer for
Oh Manchester, so much to answer for
Over the moor, I'm on the moor
the child is on the moor

 

THE HEADMASTER RITUAL

Belligerent ghouls
run Manchester schools
spineless swines
cemented mines
Sir leads the troops
jealous of youth
same old suit since 1962
he does the military two-step
down the nape of my neck
I wanna go home
I don't want to stay
give up education
is a bad mistake
mid-week on the playing fields
Sir thwacks you on the knees
knees you in the groin
elbow in the face
I wanna go home
I don't want to stay
Belligerent ghouls
run Manchester schools
spineless bastards all
Sir leads the troops
jealous of youth
same old jokes since 1902
he does the military two-step
down the nape of my neck
I wanna go home
I don't want to stay
give up life
as a bad mistake
please excuse me from gym
I've got this terrible cold coming on
he grabs and devours
he kicks me in the showers
kicks me in the showers
and he grabs and devours
I wanna go home
I don't want to stay

 

RUSHOLME RUFFIANS

The last night at the fair
by the big wheel generator
a boy is stabbed
and his money is grabbed
and the air hangs heavy like a dulling wine
she is famous
she is funny
an engagement ring
doesn't mean a thing
to a mind consumed by brass(money)
and though I walk home alone
my faith in love is still devout
the last night at the fair
from a seat on a whirling waltzer
her skirt ascends for a watching eye
it's a hideous trait( on her mother's side)
and though I walk home alone
my faith in love is still devout
then someone falls in love
and someone's beaten up
and the senses being dulled are mine
and someone falls in love
someone's beaten up
and the senses being dulled are mine
and though I walk home alone
my faith in love is still devout
this is the last night of the fair
and the grease in the hair
of a speedway operator
is all a tremulous heart requires
a schoolgirl is denied
she said "How quickly would I die
if I jumped from the top of the parachutes?"
this is the last night of the fair

I WANT THE ONE I CAN'T HAVE

On the day that your mentality
catches up with your biology
I want the one I can't have
and it's driving me mad
it's written all over my face
A double-bed
and a stalwart lover, for sure
these are the riches of the poor
A double-bed
and a stalwart lover, for sure
these are the riches of the poor
a tough kid who sometimes swallows nails
raised on Prisoner's Aid
he killed a policeman when he was thirteen
and somehow that really impressed me
it's written all over my face
On the day that your mentality
catches up with your biology
And if you ever need self-validation
just meet me in the alley by the
railway-station
it's written all over my face

 

WHAT SHE SAID

What she said:
"How come someone hasn't noticed
that I'm dead
and decided to bury me
God knows, I'm ready"
What she said was
but then, all the rejection she's had
to pretend to be happy
could only be idiocy
What she said was not for the job or
lover that she never had
What she read
all heady books
she'd sit and prophesise
(it took a tattoed boy from Birkenhead
to really really open her eyes)

THAT JOKE ISN'T FUNNY ANYMORE

Park the car at the side of the road
you should know
time's tide will smother you
and I will too
when you laugh about other people who feel so
very lonely
their only desire is to die
well I'm afraid
it doesn't make me smile
I wish I could laugh
but that joke isn't funny anymore
it's too close to home and it's too near the bone
it's too close to home and it's too near the bone
more than you'll ever know
It was dark as I drove the point home
and on cold leather seats
well, it suddenly struck me
I just might die with a smile on my
face after all
I've seen this happen in other people's lives
and now it's happening in mine

 

NOWHERE FAST

I'd like to drop my trousers to the world
I am a man of means(of slender means)
each household appliance
is like a new science in my town
and if a day came when I felt a natural emotion
I'd get such a shock I'd probably jump in the ocean
and when a train goes by
it's such a sad sound
I'd like to drop my trousers to the Queen
every sensible child will know what this means
the poor and the needy
are selfish and greedy on her terms
and if the day came when I felt a natural emotion
I'd get such a shock I'd probably jump in the ocean
and when a train goes by
it's such a sad song
And when I'm lying in my bed
I think about life
and I think about death
and neither one particularly appeals to me
and if the day came when I felt a natural emotion
I'd get such a shock I'd probably lie
in the middle of the street and die
I'd lie down and die

 

WELL I WONDER

Well I wonder
do you hear me when you sleep?
I hoarsely cry
Well I wonder
do you see me when we pass?
I half-die
Please keep me in mind
please keep me in mind
Gasping-but somehow still alive
this is the fierce last stand of all I am
Gasping-dying-but somehow still alive
this is the final stand of all I am
Please keep me in mind

 

BARBARISM BEGINS AT HOME

Unruly boys
who will not grow up
must be taken in hand
Unruly girls
who will not settle down
they must be taken in hand
A crack on the head
is what you get for not asking
and a crack on the head
is what you get for asking

 

MEAT IS MURDER

Heifer whines could be human cries
closer comes the screaming knife
this beautiful creature must die
this beautiful creature must die
a death for no reason
and death for reason is MURDER
and the flesh you so fancifully fry
is not succulent, tasty or nice
it's death for no reason
and death for no reason is MURDER
and the calf that you carve with a smile
is MURDER
and the turkey you festively slice
is MURDER
do you know how animals die?
kitchen aroma aren't very homely
it's not "comforting," "cheery" or kind
it's sizzling blood and the unholy stench
of MURDER
it's not "natural," "normal" or kind
the fleas you so fancifully fry
as you savour the flavour
of MURDER
NO, NO, NO, IT'S MURDER
NO, NO, NO, IT'S MURDER
who hears when animals cry?

 

THE QUEEN IS DEAD

Farewell to this lands cheerless marches
hemmed in like a boar between arches
her very Lowness with her head in a sling
Im truely sorry-but it sounds like a wonderful thing
dear Charles, dont you ever crave
to appear on the front of the Daily mail
dressed in your Mother's bridal veil?
So, I checked all the registered historical facts
and I was shocked into shame to discover
how Im the 18th pale descendent
of some, old queen or other
has the world changed, or have I changed?
has the world changed, or have I changed?
as some 9-year old tough peddles drugs
(I never even knew what drugs were)
And so, I broke into the Palace
with a sponge and a rusty spanner
she said: "Eh, I know you, and you cannot sing"
I said: "that's nothing -you should hear me play piano"
We can go for a walk where it's quiet and dry
and we can talk about precious things
but when you are tied to your mother's apron
not one talks about castration
We can go for a walk where it's quiet and dry
and we can talk about precious things
like love and law and poverty
these are the things that kill me
We can go for a walk where it's quiet and dry
and we can talk about precious things
but the rain that flattens my hair
theses are the things that kill me
Passed the Pub that saps your body
and the church who'll snatch your money
the Queen is dead, boys
and it's so lonely on a limb
Pass the Pub that wrecks your body
and the church-all they want is your money
the Queen is dead, boys`
you can trust me, boys
life is very long, when you're lonely
life is very long, when you're lonely...

 

FRANKLY MR.SHANKLY

Frankly, Mr Shankly, this position Ive held
it pays my way, but it corrodes my soul
I want to leave you will not miss me
I want to go down in musical history
Frankly, Mr Shankly, Im a sickening wreck
Ive got the 21st Century breathing down my neck
I must move fast, you understand me
I want to go down in celluloid history
Fame, Fame, fatal Fame
it can play hideous tricks on the brain
but still I rather be Famous
than righteous or holy, any day
but sometimes Id feel more fulfilled
making Christmas cards with the mentally ill
I want to Live and I want to Love
I want to catch something that I might be ashamed of
Frankly, Mr Shankly, this position I've held
it pays my way and it corrodes my soul
oh, I didnt realise that you wrote poetry
(I didnt realise you wrote such bloody awful poetry)
Frankly, Mr Shankly, since you ask
you are a flatulent pain the arse
I do not mean to be so rude
but still, I must speck frankly, Mr Shankly

 

I KNOW IT'S ALL OVER

Oh Mother, I can fell the soil falling over my head
and as i climb into an empty bed
Oh well, Enough said
I know it's over-still I cling
I don't know where else I can go
Oh Mother, I can feel the soil falling over my head
see, the sea want s to take me
the knife wants to cut me
do you think you can help me?
Sad veiled bride, please be happy
handsome groom, give her room
loud, loutish lover, treat her kindly
(although she needs you
more than she loves you)
and I know it's over
and it never really began
but in my heart it was so real
and you even spoke to me and said:
"If you're so funny
then why are you on your own tonight?
and if you are so clever
then why are you on your own tonight?
if you're so terribly good looking
then why do you sleep alone tonight?
because tonight is just like any other night
that's why you're on your own tonight
with your triumphs and your charms
while they are in each other's arms.."
It's so easy to laugh
it's so easy to hate
it takes strength to be gentle and kind
It's so easy to laugh
it's so easy to hate
it takes guts to be gentle and kind
love is Natural and Real
but not for you, my love
not tonight my love
love is Natural and Real
but not for such as you and I, my love
Oh Mother, I can fell the soil falling over my head
Oh Mother, I can fell the soil falling over my head...

 

NEVER HAD NO ONE EVER

When you walk without ease
on these
the very streets where you were raised
I had a really bad dream
it lasted 20 years, 7 months, and 27 days
Never had no one ever.

 

CEMETERY GATES

A dreaded sunny day
so I meet you at the cemetry gates
Keats and Yeats are on your side
A dreaded sunny day
so I meet you at the cemetry gates
Keats and Yeats are on your side
while Wilde is on mine
So we go inside and we gravely read the stones
all those people all those lives
where are they now ?
with loves, and hates
and passions just like mine
they were born
and then they lived and then they died
which seems so unfair
and I wantr to crv
You say: "ere thrice the sun hath done salutation to the dawn"
and you claim these words as your own
but Im well-read, have heard them said
a hundred times (maybe less, maybe more)
if you must write prose/poems
the words you use should be your own
dont plagiarise or take "on loans"
there's alweays someone, somewhere
with a big nose, who knows
and who trips you up and laughs
when you fall
You say: "ere long done do does did "
words which could only be your own
you then produce the text
from whence was ripped
(some dizzy whore, 1804)
A dreaded sunny day
so let's go where we're happy
so I meet you at the cemetry gates
Keats and Yeats are on your side
A dreaded sunny day
so let's go where we're wanted
so I meet you at the cemetry gates
Keats and Yeats are on your side
but you lose
because Wilde is on mine

 

BIGMOUTH STRIKES AGAIN

Sweetness, sweetness I was only joking
when I said Id like to smash every tooth
in your head
Sweetness, sweetness I was only joking
when I said by right s you should be
bludgeoned in your bed
and now I know how Joan of Arc felt
now I know how Joan of Arc felt
as the flames roseto her roman nose
and her Walkman stared to melt
Bibmouth, bigmouth
bigmouth strikes again
and Ive got no right to take my place
with the Human race
and now I know how Joan of Arc felt
now I know of Joan of Arc felt
as the flames rose to her roman nose
and her hearing aid started to melt
Bigmouth, bigmouth
bigmouth strikes again
and Ive got no right to take my place
with the Human race

 

THE BOY WITH A THORN IN HIS SIDE

The boy with the thorn in his side
behind the hatred there lies
a murderous desire for love
how can they look into my eyes
and still they dont believe me
how can they hear me say those words
and still they dont believe me
and if they don't believe me now
will they ever believe me?
and if they don't believe me now
will they ever believe me?
The boy with the thorn in his side
behind the hatred there lies
a plundering desire for love
how can they see the Love in our eyes
and still they don't believe us
and after all this time
they don't want to believe us
and if they dont believe us now
will they ever believe us ?
andd when you want to Live
how do you start ?
where do you go ?
who do you know?

 

VICAR IN A TUTU

I was minding mind business
lifting some lead off
the roof of the Holy Name church
it was worthwhile living a laughable life
just to set my eyes on a blistering sight
of a vicar in a tu-tu
he's not strange
he just wants to live his life this way
a scanty bit of a thing
with a decorative ring
that wouldn't cover the head of a child
as Rose collects the money in the cannister
who comes sliding down the bannister
the vicar in a tu-tu
he's not strange
he just wants to live his life this way
the monkish monsignor
with a head full of plaster
said "my man, get your vile soul dry-cleaned"
as Rose counts the money in the cannister
as natural as rain
he dances again
vicar in a tu-tu
The next day in the pulpit
with Freedom and Ease
combating ignoranca,dust and disease
as Rose counts the money in the cannister
as natural as rain
he dances again
the fabric of a tu-tu
any man could get us to
and I am a living sign.

 

THERE IS A LIGHT THAT NEVER GOES OUT

Take me out tonight
where there's music and there's people
who are young and alive
driving in your car
I never never want to go home
because I havent got one
anymore
take me out tonight
because I want to see people and I
want to see lights
driving in your car
oh please dont drop me home
because it's not my home, it's their
home, and Im welcome no morw
and if a double-decker bus
crashes in to us
to die by your side
such a heavenly way to die
and if a ten ton truck
kills the both of us
to die by your side
the pleasure and the privilege is mine
take me out tonight
oh take me anywhere, I dont care
and in the darken underpass
I thought Oh God, my chance has come at last
(but then a strange fear gripped me and I just couldn't ask)
take me out tonight
take me anywhere, I dont care
just driving in your car
I never never want to go home
because I havent got one
I havent got one.

 

SOME GIRLS ARE BIGGER THAN OTHERS

From the ice-age to the dole-age
there is but one concern
and I have just discover
some girls are bigger than others
some girls are bigger than others
some girls mothers are bigger than
other girls mothers
As Anthony said to Cleopatra
as he opened a crate of ale:
some girls are bigger than others
some girls are bigger than others
some girls mothers are bigger than
other girls mothers.

 

A RUSH AND A PUSH AND AND THE LAND IS OURS

HELLO
I am the ghost of Troubled Joe
hung by his pretty white neck
some eighteen months ago
I travelled to a mystical time zone
but I missed my bed
so I soon came home
they said:
"there's too much caffeine
in your bloodstream
and a lack of real spice
in your life"
I said:
"leave me alone
because I'm alright, dad
just surprised to still
be on my own...."
Ooh, but don't mention love
I'd hate the real strain of the pain again
a rush and a push and the land that
we stand on is ours
it has been before
so it shall be again
and people who are uglier than you and I
they take what they need, and leave
Ooh, but don't mention love
I'd hate the pain and the strain all over again
a rush and a push and the land that
we stand on is ours
it has been before
so why can't it be now?
and people who are weaker than you and I
they take what they want from life
Ooh, but don't mention love
no - just don't mention love!
a rush and a push and the land that
we stand on is ours
your youth may be gone
but you're still a young man
so phone me, phone me, phone me
so phone me, phone me, phone me
Ooh, I think I'm in love...
Urrgh, I think I'm in lerv

 

I STARTED SOMETHING I COULDN'T FINISH

The lanes were silent
with nothing or no one around for miles
I doused our friendly venture
with a hard-faced
three-word gesture
I started something
I forced you into a zone
and you were clearly
never meant to go
hair brushed and parted
typical me, typical me, typical me
I started something
...and now I'm not too sure
I grabbed you by the guilded beams
that's what Tradition means
and I doused another venture
with a gesture
that was...absolutely vile
I started something
forced you to a zone
and you were clearly
never meant to go
hair brushed and parted
typical me, typical me, typical me
I started something
...and now I'm not too sure
I grabbed you by the guilded beams
that's what Tradition means
and now eighteen months' hard-labour
seems...fair enough
I started something
forced you to a zone
and you were clearly
never meant to go
hair brushed and parted
typical me, typical me, typical me
I started something
and now I'm not too sure

 

DEATH OF A DISCO DANCER

The death of a disco dancer
well, it happens a lot 'round here
and if you think Peace
is a common goal
well, that goes to show
just how little you know
The death of a disco dancer
well, I'd rather not get involved
I never talk to my neighbour
I'd just rather not get involved
Love, peace and harmony?
Love, peace and harmony?
Oh, very nice, very nice, very nice, very nice
...but maybe in the next world.

 

GIRLFRIEND IN A COMA

Girlfriend in a coma, I know
I know - it's serious
Girlfriend in a coma, I know
I know - it's really serious
there wree times when I could
have 'murdered' her
(but, you know, I would hate
anything to happen to her)
NO, I DON'T WANT TO SEE HER
Do you really think
she'll pull through?
Do you really think
she'll pull through?
Girlfriend in a coma, I know
I know, it's serious
there were time when I could
have 'strangeled' her
(but, you know, I would hate
anything to happen to her)
WOULD YOU PLEASE LET ME SEE HER!
Do you really think she'll pull through?
Do you really think she'll pull through?
Let me wisper my last goodbyes
I know - IT'S SERIOUS

 

STOP ME IF YOU'VE HEARD THIS ONE BEFORE

Stop me, stop me,
stop me if you think that you've heard this one before
stop me, stop me
stop me if you think that you've heard this one before
nothing's changed
I still love you, oh I still love you
...only slightly less than I used to
I was delayed, I was way-laid
an emergency stop
I smelt the last ten seconds of life
I crashed down on the crossbar
and the pain was enough to make
a shy, bald buddhist reflect
and plan a mass-murder
who said I'd lied to her?
who said I'd lied because I never
who said I'd lied because I never
I was detained, I was restrained
he broke my spleen
he broke my knees
(and then he really laid into me)
Friday night in Out-patients
who said I'd lied to her?
who said I'd lied - because I never
who said I'd lied - because I never
Oh, so I drank one
or was it four
and when I fell on the floor
...I drank more
stop me, stop me
stop me if you think that you've heard this one before
nothing's changed
I still love you, I still love you
but only slightly
less than I used to

 

LAST NIGHT I DREAMT THAT SOMEBODY LOVED ME

Last night I dreamt
that somebody loved me
no hope - but no harm
just another false alarm
Las night I felt
real arms around me
no hope - no harm
just another false alarm
so, tell me how long
before the last one?
and tell me how long
before the right one?
this story is old - I KNOW
but it goes on
this story is old - I KNOW
but it goes on

 

UNHAPPY BIRTHDAY

I've come to wish you an unhappy birthday
I've come to wish you an unhappy birthday
because you're evil
and you lie
and if you should die
I may feel slightly sad
(but I won't cry)
Loved and lost
and some may say
when usually its Nothing
surely you're happy
it should be this way?
I say "No, I'm gonna kill my dog"
and: "May the lines sag heavy
and deep tonight XXX"
I've come to wish you an unhappy birthday
I've come to wish you an unhappy birthday
because you're evil
and you lie
and if you should die
I may feel slightly sad
(But I won't cry)
Loved and lost
some people say
when usually its Nothing
surely you're happy
it should be this way?
I said "No"
and then I shot myself
so, drink, drink, drink
and be ill tonight
from the one you left behind
from the one you left behind...

 

PAINT A VULGAR PICTURE

At the record company meeting
On their hands - a dead star
and ooh, the plans that they weave
and ooh, the sikening greed
At the record company meeting
on their hands - a dead star
the sycophantic slags all say:
"I knew him first, and I knew him well"
Re-issue! Re-package! Re-package!
Re-evaluate the songs
double-pack with a photograph
Extra Track (and a tacky badge)
A-list, playlist
"Please them, please them!"
"Please them! Please them!"
(sadly, THIS was your life)
but you could have said no
if you'd wanted to
you could have said no
if you'd wanted to
BPI, MTV, BBC
"Please them! Please them!"
(sadly this was your life)
but you could have said no
if you'd wanted to
you could have walked away
...couldn't you?
I touched you at the soundcheck
you had no real way of knowing
in my heart I bgged "please, take
me with you...
I don't care where you're going"
But to you I was faceless
I was fawning, I was boring
just a child from those ugly new houses
who could never begin to know
who could never really know
Best of? Most of?
Satiate the need
slip them into different sleeves!
Buy both, and be decieved
climber - new entry, re-entry
World tour! ("media whore")
"Please the Press in Belgium!"
(THIS was your life...)
and when it fails to recoup?
Well, maybe:
You just haven't earned it yet, baby
I walked a pace behind you at the soundcheck
you're just the same as I am
what makes most people feel happy
leads us headlong into harm
so, in my bedroom in those 'ugly new houses'
I dance my legs down to the knees
but me and my 'true love'
we will never meet again...
At the record company meeting
on their hands - at last! - a dead star!
but they cannot taint you in my eyes
no, they cannout touch you now
No, they cannot hurt you my darling
they cannot touch you now
but me and my 'true love'
will never meet again

 

DEATH AT ONE'S ELBOW

Ooh Glenn, don't come to the house tonight
Ooh, Glenn, don't come to the house tonight
because there's somebody here
who really really loves you
stay home
be bored
(it's crap, I KNOW)
Ooh, Glenn, don't come to the house tonight
Ooh, Glen, don't come to the house tonight
because there's somebody here
who'll take a hatchet to your ear
how the frustration renders me
hateful, Glenn!
don't come to the house tonight
don't come to the house tonight
because you'll slip on the
trail of my bespattered remains
and so, that's why
GOODBYE MY LOVE, GOODBYE MY LOVE, GOODBYE MY LOVE...
Belch

 

I WON'T SHARE YOU

I won't share you
I won't share you
with the drive and ambition
and the zeal I feel
this is my time
as the note I wrote
was read, she said
has the Perrier gone
straight to my head
or is life plainly sick and cruel, instead?
"YES!"
No-no-no-no-no-no
I won't share you
I won't share you
with the drive and the dreams inside
this is my time
Life tends to come and go
well, that's OK
just as long as you know
Life tends to come and go
well, that's OK
just as long as you know
I won't share you
I won't share you
with the drive and the dreams inside
this is my time, this is my time

PANIC

Panic on the streets of London
Panic on the streets of Birmingham
I wonder to myself
Could life ever be sane again
on the Leeds side-streets that you slip down
I wonder to myself
Hopes may rise on the Grasmeres
But Honey Pie, you're not safe here
So you run down
To the safety of the town
But there's Panic on the streets of Carlisle
Dublin, Dundee, Humberside
I wonder to myself
Burn down the Disco
Hang the blessed D.J.
Because the music that they constantly play
IT SAYS NOTHING TO ME ABOUT MY LIFE
Hang the blessed D.J.
Because the music they constantly play
On the Leeds side-streets that you slip down
On the provincial towns that you jog 'round
Hang the D.J.,. Hang the D.J.,.Hang the D.J...

ASK

Shyness is nice, but
Shyness can stop you
From doing all the things in life
That you'd like to
So, if there's something you'd like to try
ASK ME-I WON'T SAY "NO"-HOW COULD I?
Coyness is nice, but ,
Coyness can stop you
from saying all the things in
life that you want to
If there's something that you'd like to try
ASK ME-I WON'TSAY"NO"-HOW COULD I?
Spending warm, Summer days indoors
Writing fringhtening verse
To a buck-toothed girl in Luxembourg
ASK ME, ASK ME ,ASK ME, ASK ME, ASK ME ,ASK ME
Because if it's not Love
Then it's the Bomb
That will bring us together
Nature is a language-can't you read?
Nature is a language-can't you read?
ASK ME, ASK ME ,ASK ME, ASK ME, ASK ME ,ASK ME

MARIE'S THE NAME (HIS LATEST FLAME) / RUSHOLME RUFFIANS

Very old friend 
Came by today 
As he was telling everyone in town 
Of all the love that he'd just found 
And Marie's the name (of his latest flame) 
Talked and talked 
And I heard him say 
That she had the longest blackest hair 
Prettiest green eyes anywhere 
And Marie's the name (of his latest flame) 
The last night of the fair 
By the big wheel generator 
A boy is stabbed 
His money is grabbed 
And the air hangs heavy like a dulling wine 
She is Famous 
She is Funny 
An engagement ring 
Doesn't mean a thing 
To a mind consumed by brass (money), oh 
The last night of the fair 
From a seat on a whirling waltzer 
Her skirt ascends for a watching eye 
It's a hideous trait (on her mother's side)
From a seat on a whirling waltzer 
Her skirt ascends for a watching eye 
A hideous trait (on her mother's side) 
Then someone falls in love 
Someone's beaten up 
Someone's beaten up 
And the senses being dulled are mine 
And someone falls in love 
Someone's beaten up 
And the senses being dulled are mine 
This is the last night of the fair 
And the grease in the hair 
Of a speedway operator 
Is all a tremulous heart requires 
A schoolgirl is denied 
She said : "How quickly would I die 
If I jumped from the top of the parachutes ?"
This is the last night of the fair 
And the grease in the hair 
Of a speedway operator 
Is all a tremulous heart requires 
A schoolgirl is denied 
She said : "How quickly would I die 
Oh, if I jumped from the top of the parachutes ?"
...Oh, walk home alone 
I might walk home alone 
But my faith in love is still devout

RUBBER RING / WHAT SHE SAID

Yeah! What she says : 
"How come someone hasn't noticed 
That I'm dead 
And decided to bury me ? 
God knows, I'm ready !"
La-la-la ... 
What she said was sad 
But then, all the rejection she's had 
To pretend to be happy 
Could only be idiocy 
La-la-la ... 
What she said was not for the job or 
Lover that she never had 
No no no ... 
What she read 
All heady books 
She'd sit and prophesise 
(It took a tattooed boy from 
Birkenhead 
To really really open her eyes)
What she read 
All heady books 
She'd sit and prophesise 
(It took a tattooed boy from 
Birkenhead 
To really really open her eyes)
What she said : 
"I smoke because I'm hoping for an 
Early death 
AND I NEED TO CLING TO SOMETHING !"
What she said :

No no no no ...

 

IS IT REALLY SO STRANGE?

I left the North 
I travelled South 
I found a tiny house 
And I can't help the way I feel 
Oh yes, you can kick me 
And you can punch me 
And you can break my face 
But you won't change the way I feel 
'Cause I love you, Oh ... 
And is it really so strange ? 
Oh, is it really so strange ? 
Oh, is it really so, really so strange ? 
I say NO, you say YES 
(and you will change your mind) 
I left the South 
I travelled North 
I got confused - I killed a horse 
I can't help the way I feel 
Oh yes, you can punch me 
And you can butt me 
And you can break my spine 
But you won't change the way I feel 
'Cause I love you, Oh ... 
And is it really so strange ? 
Oh, is it really so strange ? 
Oh, is it really so, really so strange ? 
I say NO, you say YES 
(But you will change your mind) 
I left the North again 
I travelled South again 
And I got confused - I killed a nun 
I CAN'T HELP THE WAY I FEEL 
(I lost my bag in Newport Pagnell) 
Why is the last mile the hardest mile ? 
My throat was dry, with the sun in my eyes 
And I realised, I realised 
I could never 
I could never, never, never, go back home again

 

CEMETERY GATES

A dreaded sunny day
so I meet you at the cemetry gates
Keats and Yeats are on your side
A dreaded sunny day
so I meet you at the cemetry gates
Keats and Yeats are on your side
while Wilde is on mine
So we go inside and we gravely read the stones
all those people all those lives
where are they now ?
with loves, and hates
and passions just like mine
they were born
and then they lived and then they died
which seems so unfair
and I wantr to crv
You say: "ere thrice the sun hath done salutation to the dawn"
and you claim these words as your own
but Im well-read, have heard them said
a hundred times (maybe less, maybe more)
if you must write prose/poems
the words you use should be your own
dont plagiarise or take "on loans"
there's alweays someone, somewhere
with a big nose, who knows
and who trips you up and laughs
when you fall
You say: "ere long done do does did "
words which could only be your own
you then produce the text
from whence was ripped
(some dizzy whore, 1804)
A dreaded sunny day
so let's go where we're happy
so I meet you at the cemetry gates
Keats and Yeats are on your side
A dreaded sunny day
so let's go where we're wanted
so I meet you at the cemetry gates
Keats and Yeats are on your side
but you lose
because Wilde is on mine

 

LONDON

Smoke
Lingers 'round your fingers
Train
Heave on - to Euston
Do you think you've made
The right decision this time?
You left
Your tired family grieving
And you think they're sad because you're leaving
But didn't you see the Jealousy in the eyes
Of the ones who had to stay behind?
And do you think you've made
The right decision thins time?
You left
Your girlfriend on the platform
With thei really ragged notion that you'll return
But she knows
That when he goes
He really goes
So do you think you've made
The right decision this time?

 

I KNOW IT'S OVER

I can feel the soil falling over my head 
And as I climb into an empty bed 
Oh well. Enough said. 
I know it's over - still I cling 
I don't know where else I can go 
Over ... 
Oh Mother, I can feel the soil falling over my head 
See, the sea wants to take me 
The knife wants to cut me 
Do you think you can help me ? 
Sad veiled bride, please be happy 
Handsome groom, give her room 
Loud, loutish lover, treat her kindly 
(Though she needs you 
More than she loves you) 
And I know it's over - still I cling 
I don't know where else I can go 
Over, it's over, it's over, it's over 
It's over, la ... 
I know it's over 
And it never really began 
But in my heart it was so real
And you even spoke to me, and said : 
"If you're so funny 
Then why are you on your own tonight ? 
And if you're so clever 
Then why are you on your own tonight ? 
I know ... 
'Cause tonight - it's just like any other night 
That's why you're on your own tonight 
Your triumphs and your charms 
While they're in each other's arms..."
It's so easy to laugh 
It's so easy to hate 
It takes strength to be gentle and kind 
Over, over, over, over 
It's so easy to laugh 
It's so easy to hate 
It takes guts to be gentle and kind 
Over, over 
Love is Natural and Real 
But not for you, my love 
Not tonight, my love 
Love is Natural and Real 
But not for such as you and I, my love 
Oh Mother, I can feel the soil falling over my head...
Oh Mother, I can feel the soil fall over, fall over my head 
Oh Mother, I can feel the ... fall over my ... , Oh ...

 

THE DRAIZE TRAIN

A vastly superior version of the instrumental B-side, acting as a peace 
offering to Marr (Morrissey chose the tracks for the compilation, 
and of course, receives no royalties on this track).

 

STILL ILL

I decree today that life
is simply taking and not giving
England is mine and it owes me a living
ask me why, and I'll spit in your eye
ask me why, and I'll spit in your eye
but we cannot cling to the old dreams anymore
no, we cannot cling to the old dreams anymore
Does the body rule the mind
or does the mind rule the body?
I dunno...
Under the iron bridge we kissed
and although I ended up with sore lips
it just wasn't like the old days anymore
no, it wasn't like those days
am I still ill?
Does the body rule the mind
or does the mind rule the body ?
I dunno...
Ask me why, and I'll die
ask me why, and I'll die
and if you must go to work tomorrow
well, if I were you I wouldn't bother
for there are brighter sides to life
and I should know because I've seen them
but not very often...
under the iron bridge we kissed
and although I ended up with sore lips
it just wasn't like the old days anymore
no, it wasn't like those days
am I still ill?

 

BIGMOUTH STRIKES AGAIN

Sweetness, sweetness I was only joking
when I said Id like to smash every tooth
in your head
Sweetness, sweetness I was only joking
when I said by right s you should be
bludgeoned in your bed
and now I know how Joan of Arc felt
now I know how Joan of Arc felt
as the flames roseto her roman nose
and her Walkman stared to melt
Bibmouth, bigmouth
bigmouth strikes again
and Ive got no right to take my place
with the Human race
and now I know how Joan of Arc felt
now I know of Joan of Arc felt
as the flames rose to her roman nose
and her hearing aid started to melt
Bigmouth, bigmouth
bigmouth strikes again
and Ive got no right to take my place
with the Human race

 
ALSATIAN COUSTIN

Were you and he Lovers?
and would you say so if you were?
on a forecourt
on a Friday
passing my way
Were you and he Lovers?
and if you were, then say that you were!
on a groundsheet
under canvas
with your tent-flap
open wide
A note upon his desk:
"P.S. Bring Me Home And Have Me!"
Leather elbows on a tweed coat
- Oh! -
Is THAT the best you can do?
So came his reply:
"...but on the desk is where I want you!"
So I ask (even though I know):
were you and he Lovers?

 

LITTLE MAN, WHAT NOW?

An afternoon nostalgia
television show
you spoke in silhouette
(but they couldn't name you)
although the panel were
very polite to you
but I remembered you
from Friday nights 1969
ATV - you murdered every line
too old to be a child star
too young to take leads
four seasons passed
and they AXED you
nervously juvenile
(WON'T SMILE!)
What became of you?
did that swift eclipse torture you?
a star at eighteen
and then-suddenly gone
down to a few lines
in the back page of a teenage annual
oh but I remembered you
I looked up to you

 

EVERYDAY IS LIKE SUNDAY

Trudging slowly over wet sand
back to the bench
where your clothes were stolen
this is the coastal town
that they forgot to close down
Armageddon - come Armageddon!
Come Armageddon! Come!
Everyday is like Sunday
everyday is silent and grey
Hide on the promenade
scratch out a postcard
"how I dearly with I was not here"
in the seaside town
...that they forgot to bomb
Come! Come! Come - nuclear bomb!
Everyday is like Sunday
everyday is silent and grey
Trudging back over pebbles and sand
and a strange dust lands on your hands
(and on your face)
Everyday is like Sunday
"Win Yourself A Cheap Tray"
share some greased tea with me
everyday is silent and grey

 

BENGALI IN PLATFORMS

No no no
he does not want to depress you
oh no no no no no
he only wants to impress you
Bengali in platform
she only wants to embrace your culture
and to be your friend forever
Bengali, Bengali
oh shelve your Western plans
and understand that life is hard enough when you belong here
A silver-studded rim that glistens
and an ankle-star that...blinds me
a lemon sole so very high
which only reminds me, to tell you
so I break the news gently
I break the news to you gently
"Shelve your plans"
Bengali, Bengali
its the touchy march of time
that blinds you
don't blame me
don't hate me
just because I'm the one to tell you
that life is hard enough when you belong here
life is hard enough when you belong here
shelve your western plans
life is hard enough when you belong here

 

ANGEL, ANGEL, DOWN WE GO TOGETHER

Angel, Angel
don't take your life tonight
I know they take
and that they take in turn
and they give you nothing real
for yourself in return
and when they've used you
and they've broken you
and wasted all your money
and cast your shell aside
and when they've bought you
and they've sold you
and they've billed you for the pleasure
and they've made your parents cry
I will be here
BELIEVE ME
I will be here
...believe me
Angel, don't take your life
some people have got no pride
they do not understand
the Urgency of life
but I love you more than life
I love you more than life
I love you more than life
I love you more than life

 

LALE NIGHT, MAUDLIN STREET

The last night on Maudlin Street
goodbye house
goodbye stairs
I was born here
I was raised here, and
...I took some stick here
love at first sight
may sound trite
but it's true, you know
I could list the details
of everything you ever wore
or said, or how you stood that day
and as we spend the last night
on Maudlin Street, I say
"goodbye house-forever!"
I never stole a happy hour
around here
Where the world's ugliest boy
became what you see
here I am - the ugliest man
Its the last night on Maudlin Street
and truly I do love you
oh, truly I do love you
When I sleep with that picture of
you framed beside my bed
oh, it's childish and it's silly
but I think it's you in my room
by the bed (...yes, I told you it was silly...)
and I know
I took strange pills
but I never meant to hurt you
oh truly I love you
I came home late one night
everyone had gone to bed
nobody stays up for you
when you have sixteen stitches
all around your head
the last buss I missed to Maudlin Street
so, he drove me home in the Van
complaining: "Women only like me for my mind..."
don't leave your torch behind
power-cuts ahead
as we crept through the park
but no I cannot steal a pair of jeans
off a clothesline for you
but you...without clothes
oh I could not keep a straight face
me - without clothes?
well a nation turns its back and gags...
I'm packed
I am moving house
a half-life disappears today
every slag waves me on
(secretly wishing me gone
well, I will be soon
oh - I will be soon)
There were bad times on Maudlin Street
when they took you away in a police car
dear Inspector - don't you know?
don't you care?
don't you know - about Love?
Your gran died
and your mother died
on Maudlin Street
in pain and ashamed
with never time to say
those special things
I took the keys from Maudlin Street
well, it's only bricks and mortar!
and...truly I do love you
wherever you are
wherever you are

 

SUEDHEAD

Why do you come here
why do you hang around
I'm so sorry
I'm so sorry
Why do you come here
when you know it makes
things hard for me
when you know, oh
why do you come?
Why do you telephone?
and why send me silly notes?
I'm so sorry
I'm so sorry
why do you come here
when you know it makes
thing hard for me
when you know, oh
why do you come?
You had to sneak into my room
'just' to read my diary
was it just to see all the things
you knew I'd written about you?
and...so many illustrations
I'm so very sickened
oh, I am so sickened NOW

 

BREAK UP THE FAMILY

The strange logic of your clumsiest line
stayed emblazoned on my mind
break up the family
and lets begin to live our lives
I went to see all my friends tonight
it wasn't Youth, it wasn't even Life
born Old, sadly wise
resigned (well, we were)
to ending our lives
I'm so glad to grow older
to move away from those awful times
I want to see all my friends tonight
Yes you found love but you weren't
at peace with your life
home late, full of Hate
despise the ties that bind
oh I'm so glad to grow older
to move away from those younger years
now I'm in love for the first time
and I don't feel bad
Let me see all my old friends
let me put my arm around them
because I really do love them
now, does that sound mad?
Captain of games, solid framed
I stood on the touchline
hailstones, driven home
in his car - no breaks? I don't mind
I'm just so glad to grow older
to move away from those darker years
I'm in love for the first time
and I don't feel bad
so wish me luck my friends
goodbye

 

HAIRDRESSER ON FIRE

Here is London
here is London
is it home of the free,
or what?
can you squeeze me
into an empty page of your diary
and psychologically save me
I've got faith in you
I sense the power
in the fingers
within an hour the power
can totally destroy me
or it could same my life
here is London
'home of the brash, outrageous
and free'
you are repressed
but you're remarkably dressed
is it Real?
but you're far to busy
busy scissors
busy clippers
hair dresser on fire
all around Sloane Square
and you're far too busy
to see me
"busy,busy"
hairdresser on fire
was a client over-cautious
he made you nervous
and when he said
"I'm gonna sue you"
I really felt for you
so can you squeeze me
into an empty page of your diary
and supernaturally change me
CHANGE ME, CHANGE ME

 

THE ORDINARY BOYS

Ordinary boys, happy knowing nothing
happy being no one, but themselves
Ordinary girls, supermarket clothes
who think it's very clever to be cruel to you
for you were so different
you stood all alone
and you knew
that it had to be so
avoiding ordinary boys
happy going nowhere, just around here
in their rattling cars
and ordinary girls
never seeing further
than the cold, small streets
that trap them
but you were so different
you had to say no
when those empty fools
tried to change you, and claim you
for the lair of their ordinary world
where they feel so lucky
so lucky, so lucky
with their lives laid out before them
they're so lucky, so lucky
so lucky, so lucky

 

I DON'T MIND IF YOU FORGET ME

I don't mind
I don't mind if you forget me
having learned my lesson
I never left an impression on anyone
so now you send me your hardened 'regards'
when once you'd send me 'love'
sincerely I must tell you
your mild 'best wishes'
they make me suspicious
but I don't mind
I don't mind if you forget me
having learned my lesson
I never left
an impression on anyone
the pressure to change, to move on
was strange
and very strong
so this is why I tell you
I really do understand
BYE BYE
I don't mind if you forget me
no no no no no no no
REJECTION IS ONE THING
BUT REJECTION FROM A FOOL
IS CRUEL
REJECTION IS ONE THING
BUT REJECTION FROM A FOOL
IS CRUEL
and I don't mind if you forget me
I don't mind if your forget me

 

DIAL-A-CLICHE

Further into the fog I fall
well, I was just
following you!
when you said:
"Do as I do and scrap your fey ways"
(dial-a-cliche)
"grow up, be a man, and close your mealy-mouth!"
(dial-a-cliche)
But the person underneath
where does he go?
does he slide by the wayside?
or...does he just die?
when you find that you've organized
your feelings, for people
who didn't like you then
and certainly don't like you now
yet still you say:
"Do as I do and scrap your fey ways"
(dial-a-cliche)
"grow up, be a man, and close your mealy-mouth!"
(dial-a-cliche)
"the Safe way is the only way!
there's always time to change, son!"
yes well I've changed
but I'm in pain!
dial-a-chiche

 

MARGARET ON THE GUILLOTINE

The kind people
have a wonderful dream
Margaret on the guillotine
because people like you
make me feel so tired
when will you die?
when will you die?
when will you die?
when will you die?
when will you die?
because people like you
make me feel so old inside
please die
and kind people
do not shelter this dream
make it real
make the dream real
make the dream real
make it real

 

OUR FRANK

Our frank and open
deep conversations
they get me nowhere
they bring me down, so
give it a rest, won't you?
give me a cigarette
God give me patience
just no more conversation
Give us a drink
and make it quick
or else I'm gonna be sick
sick all over
your frankly vulgar
red pullover
now see how the colours blend
Our frank and open
deep conversations
they get me nowhere
they bring me down, so
give it a rest, won't you?
now will you just give over
the world may be ending
but look, I'm only human
Give us a drink
and make it quick
or else I'm gonna be sick
all over
your frankly vulgar
red pullover
now see how the two colours blend
Won't somebody stop me
from thinking all the time
about everything
so deeply
so bleakly

 

ASIAN RUT

Day oh so late
strangely the sun still shone
oh Asian boy
what are you on?
Day oh so late
strangely the sun still shone
what drugs are you on?
Tooled-up Asian boy
has come here to avenge
the cruel, cold killing
of his very best friend
Tooled-up Asian boy
has come here to take revenge
for the cruel, cold killing
of his only friend
Peace through the school
so quiet in the hall
it's a strange sign for one
of what's to come
Tough and hard and pale
oh they may just impale you on railings
oh English boys
it must be wrong
three against one?
Brakes slammed, and
a gun jammed, and
as far as I could tell
brave Asian boy
dealt a blow and fell
I'm just passing through here
on my way to somewhere civilised
and maybe I'll even arrive
maybe I'll even arrive?

 

SING YOUR LIFE

Sing your life
any fool can think of words that rhyme
many others do
why don't you?
do you want to?
Sing your life
just walk right up to the microphone
and name
all the things that you love
all the things that you loathe
sing your life
all the things that you love
all the things that you loathe
oh sing your life
oh sing your life
Others sang your life
but now's your chance to shine
and have the pleasure of
saying what you mean
the rare pleasure of
meaning what you sing
oh, make no mistake, my friend
all of this will end
so sing it now
all the things you love
all the things you loathe
oh sing your life
all the things that you love
all the things that you loathe
oh sing your, oh sing your
Don't leave it all unsaid
somewhere in the wasteland of your head
and make no mistake, my friend
your pointless life will end
but before you go
can you look at the truth?
You have a lovely singing voice
a lovely singing voice
and all of those
who sing on key
they stole the notion
from you and me

 

MUTE WITNESS

Your poor witness
crying so loudly on the floor
oh but she's only trying to tell you
what it was that she saw
she is only trying to tell you
what it was that she saw
Now see her standing on the table
with her small arms flailing
and you feel such compassion
in your soul for
Your poor mute witness
still testing the strength
of our patience
oh but she's only trying to tell you
what it was that she saw
Now see her pointing to the frisbee
with a memory too fuzzy
as her silent words
describe the fright of last night
4 a.m. Norhtside, Clapham Common
who knows what she was doing there?
will she sketch the answer later?
Well, I'll ask her
"now dry your tears, my dear"
Now see her mime in time so nicely
it would all have been so clear
is only she had never volunteered
"your taxi is here, my dear"

 

KING LEER

Your boyfriend, he
went down on one knee
well, could it be
he's only got one knee?
I tried to surprise you
with Vodka
or, Tizer
I can't quite remember
but you didn't thank me
you didn't even thank me
because you never do
Your boyfriend, he
has the gift of the gab
or, could it be
the gift of the grab?
I tried to surprise you
I lay down beside you
and...nothing much happened
and you didn't phone me
you didn't even phone me
because it's not your style
to dial
Your boyfriend, he
displays to me
more than just
a hint of cruelty
I tried to surprise you
I crept up behind you
with a homeless chihuahua
you gushed for an hour
you handed him back and said
"You'll never guess
I'm bored now"

 

FOUND FOUND FOUND

found found found found found found
someone who's worth it
in this murkiness
someone who's never
seeming scheming
found found found found found found
someone who's worth it
in this murkiness
someone who's never
seeming scheming
Oh, but if I'd never found
oh, but if I'd never found
oh, but if I'd never found
I do believe that
the more you give your love
and I do believe that
the more you offer trust
the more you chase
the more you cry
the more you're bound to lose
the more you're bound to lose
Oh, but if I'd never found
oh, but if I'd never found
somebody
who wants to be
who wants to be
with me
all the time

 

DRIVING YOUR GIRLFRIEND HOME

I'm driving
your girlfriend home
and she's saying
how she never chose you
"turn left", she says
so I turn left
and she says
"So how did I end up
so deeply involved in
the very existence
I planned on avoiding?"
and I can't answer
I'm driving
your girlfriend home
and she's laughing
to stop herself crying
"drive on", she says
so I drive on
and she says
"So how did I end up
attached to this person
when his sense of humour
gets gradually worser?"
and I can't tell her
I'm parking
outside her home
and we're shaking hands
goodnight, so politely

 

THE HARSH TRUTH OF THE CAMERA EYE

Churchillian legs
hair barely there
the harsh truth of the camera eye
Your eyes signal pain
because of the strain
of smiling
the harsh truth of the camera eye
telling you all
that you never wnated to know
showing what
you didn't want shown
My so friendly lens
zooms into
"the inner you"
and it tells the harsh truth
and nothing but
Laugh with us all here
that's if you can
then take the pictures home
and screamtelling you all
that you never wanted to know
showing you what
you didn't want shown
This photographer
he must have really had it in for you
"Oh, I don't want
to be judged anymore
I don't wnat to be judged
I would sooner be Loved
I would sooner be
just blindly Loved..."

 

(I'M) THE END OF THE FAMILY LINE

With no complications
fifteen generations
(of mine)
all honouring Nature
until I arrive
(with incredible style)
I'm the end fo the line
the end of the family line
the end of the line
No baby pulled screaming
out into this seething whirl
by chance or whim
(or even love?)
our family tree hacked into decline
and I'm spared the pain
of ever saying
("goodbye")
I'm the end of the line
the end of the family line
the end of the line

 

THERE'S A PLACE IN HELL FOR ME AND MY FRIENDS

There is a place
reserved
for me and my friends
and when we go
we all will go
so you see
I'm never alone
there is a place
with a bit more time
and a few more
gentler words
and looking back
we do forgive
(we had no choice
we always did)
all that we hope
is that when we go
our skin
and our blood
and our bones
don't get in your way
making you ill
the way they did
when we lived
There is a place
a place in hell
reserved
for me and my friends
and if ever I
wanted to cry
then I will
because I can

 

TONY THE PONY

Still drinking on the corner 
Just don't say I didn't warn you 
Always nagging big brother 
He's only looking out for you 
Tony The Pony 
Tony The Pony 
You're still standing on the corner 
Just don't say I didn't warn you 
Old and jealous big brother 
You had your time and you spent it 
Crying 
Now, Tony The Pony 
Tony The Pony 
So, that's what they call you now ? 
When you're free outside 
So cold and hard and in control 
And ... 
There's a free ride on 
Tony The Pony 
Oh, why do you always wanna stop me 
From doing the things in life that make me happy ? 
And when I'm outside with friends, laughing loudly 
Why do you always wanna stop me ? 
Oh, I would never 
I would never 
But you will carry the can for anyone 
The free ride on 
Gullible Tony 
You're drunker quicker 
And you're sicker even quicker 
For something heavy is gonna fall on you 
Oh ... 
And what do they call you now ? 
When you're free outside 
So cold and hard and in control 
And, oh ... been a lark 
There's a free ride on 
Fucked-up Tony 
I will never say I told you so 
Or how I knew that something bad 
Would happen to you 
I don't wanna say I told you so 
Oh, but Tony, I told you so !!! 
I told you so

 

YOU'RE GONNA NEED SOMEONE ON YOUR SIDE

With the world's fate 
Resting on your shoulder 
You're gonna need 
Someone on your side 
You can't do it by yourself 
Any longer 
You're gonna need 
Someone on your side 
Someone kindly told me 
That you'd wasted 
Eight of nine lives
Oh, give yourself a break 
Before you break down 
You're gonna need someone on your side 
And here I am, And here I am 
Well, you don't need 
To look so pleased ! 
Day or night, 
There is no difference 
You're gonna need someone on your side 
Day or night, 
There is no difference 
You're gonna need someone soon 
And here I am, And here I am 
Well, you don't need 
To look so pleased

 

GLAMOROUS GLUE

First day with the jar 
You find 
Everyone lies 
First day with the jar 
You find 
Everyone lies, nobody minds 
Everyone lies 
Where is the man you respect ? 
And where is the woman you love ? 
Where's the woman you love ? 
Third week with the jar
You find 
Everything dies 
We won't vote Conservative 
Because we never have 
Everyone lies, everyone lies 
Where is the man you respect ? 
And where is the woman you love ? 
Where's the woman you love ? 
Everything of worth 
On Earth Is there To share 
I used to dream, and I used to vow 
I wouldn't dream of it now 
We look to Los Angeles 
For the language we use 
London is dead, London is dead, London is dead...
Now I'm too much in love 
I'm too much in love 
I know 
I'll go 
Empty hand 
From the land

 

WE'LL LET YOU KNOW

How sad are we ? 
And how sad have we been ? 
We'll let you know 
We'll let you know 
Oh, but only if - you're really interested 
You wonder how 
We've stayed alive 'till now 
We'll let you know 
We'll let you know 
But only if - you're really interested 
We're all smiles 
Then, honest, I swear, it's the turnstiles 
That make us hostile 
Oh ... 
We will descend 
On anyone unable to defend 
Themselves 
Oh ... 
And the songs we sing 
They're not supposed to mean a thing 
La, la, la, la ... 
Oh ...You're lonely, Oh ... you're lonely, Oh ... 
GET OFF THE ROOF ! Oh ... 
Your Arsenal !
We may seem cold, or 
We may even be 
The most depressing people you've ever known 
At heart, what's left, we sadly know 
That we are the last truly British people you'll ever know 
We are the last truly British people you will ever know 
You'll never never want to know

 

THE NATIONAL FRONT DISCO

David, the wind blows 
The wind blows ... 
Bits of your life away 
Your friends all say ... 
"Where is our boy ? Oh, we've lost our boy" 
But they should know 
Where you've gone 
Because again and again you've explained that 
You're going to ... 
Oh, you're going to ... 
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah 
England for the English ! 
England for the English ! 
David, the winds blow 
The winds blow ...
All of my dreams away 
And I still say : 
"Where is our boy ? Ah, we've lost our boy" 
But I should know 
Why you've gone 
Because again and again you've explained
You've gone to the ... 
National, ah ... 
To the National .. 
There's a country; you don't live there 
But one day you would like to 
And if you show them what you're made of 
Oh, then you might do ... 
But David, we wonder 
We wonder if the thunder 
Is ever really gonna begin 
Begin, begin 
Your mom says : 
"I've lost my boy" 
But she should know 
Why you've gone 
Because again and again you've explained 
You've gone to the : 
National 
To the National 
To the National Front Disco 
Because you want the day to come sooner 
You want the day to come sooner 
You want the day to come sooner 
When you've settled the score 
Oh, the National 
Oh, the National

 

CERTAIN PEOPLE I KNOW

I take the cue from 
Certain people I know 
I use the cue 
And then I 
Hand it on to you 
And when I swing it 
So, it catches his eye ... 
(Weren't you there ? 
- You'd have died !) 
I trust the views of 
Certain people I know 
They look at Danger 
And they 
LAUGH THEIR HEADS OFF 
Their clothes are Imitation 
George the 23rd 
(Don't you find this absurd ?) 
I'd hate to be like 
Certain people I know 
They break their necks 
And can't afford to
Get them fixed 
Ah, they'd sacrifice all 
Of their principles for 
anything cashable 
I do believe it's terrible 
Oh, wo, wo, Ah, ah, ah, ah, Oh, wo, wo...

 

WE HATE IT WHEN OUR FRIENDS BECOME SUCCESSFUL

We hate it when our friends become successful 
We hate it when our friends become successful 
Oh, look at those clothes 
Now look at that face, it's so old 
And such a video ! 
Well, it's really laughable 
Ha, ha, ha ...
We hate it when our friends become successful 
And if they're Northern, that makes it even worse
And if we can destroy them 
You bet your life we will 
Destroy them 
If we can hurt them 
Well, we may as well ... 
It's really laughable 
Ha, ha, ha ... 
You see, it should've been me 
It could've been me 
Everybody knows 
Everybody says so 
They say : 
"Ah, you have loads of songs 
So many songs 
More songs than they'd stand 
Verse 
Chorus 
Middle eight 
Break, fade 
Just listen ..."

SEASICK, YET STILL DOCKED

I am a poor freezingly cold soul 
So far from where 
I intended to go 
Scavenging through life's very constant lulls 
So far from where I'm determined to go 
Wish I knew the way to reach the one I love
There is no way ... 
Wish I had the charm to attract the one I love 
But you see, I've got no charm 
Mmm...
Tonight I've consumed much more than I can hold 
Oh, this is very clear to you 
And you can tell I have never really loved 
You can tell, by the way, I sleep all day
And all of my life no-one gave me anything 
No-one has ever given me anything 
My love is as sharp as a needle in your eye 
You must be such a fool 
To pass me by

 

I KNOW IT'S GONNA HAPPEN SOMEDAY

My love, wherever you are 
Whatever you are 
Don't lose faith 
I know it's gonna happen someday 
To you 
Please wait ... Please wait ... Oh ... Wait ... 
Don't lose faith 
You say that the day just never arrives 
And it's never seemed so far away 
Still, I know it's gonna happen someday 
To you 
Please wait ... 
Don't lose faith

 

TOMORROW

Tomorrow 
Will it really come ?

All I ask of you is one thing that you never do 
Would you put your arms around me ?

Tomorrow 
Does it have to come ?
All I ask of you is one thing that you'll never do 
Would you put your arms around me ? 
(I won't tell anybody) 
Tomorrow 
And what must come before ...
Oh, the pain in my arms 
Oh, the pain in my legs 
Ooh, my shiftless body 
Tomorrow 
It's surely nearer now ? 
You don't think I'll make it 
I never said I wanted to ! 
Well did I ? 
Oh, the pain in my arms 
Oh, the pain in my legs 
Oh, yeah; oh, yeah, No, yeah; no, yeah 
Through my shiftless body 
Tomorrow, Tomorrow 
All I ask of you ... oh ... 
Is : would you tell me that you love me 
Tell me, tell me that you love me, Tell me, tell me that you love me ... 
Ah, I know you don't mean it

Tell me, tell me that you love me, Tell me, tell me that you love me ...

NOVEMBER SPAWNED A MONSTER

Sleep on and dream of Love
because it's the closest you will get to love
poor twisted child, so ugly, so ugly
poor twisted child, oh hug me, oh hug me
one November spawned a monster 
in the shape of this child who later cried
"But Jesus made me, so Jesus save me from
pity, sympathy and people discussing me"
a frame of useless limbs what can make GOOD
all the BAD that's been done?
And if the lights were out
could you even bear
to kiss her full on the mouth (or anywhere?)
poor twisted child, so ugly, so ugly
poor twisted child, oh hug me, oh hug me
one November spawned a monster 
in the shape of this child who must remain
a hostage to kindess and the wheels underneath her
a hostage to kindess and the wheels underneath her
a symbol of where mad, mad lovers
must PAUSE and draw the line
So sleep and dream of love
because it's the closest
you will get to love
that November is a time which I must put OUT of my mind
oh one fine day 
LET IT BE SOON
she won't be rich or beautiful
but she'll be walking your streets
in the clothes that she went out
and chose for herself

 

SEASICK, YET STILL DOCKED

I am a poor freezingly cold soul 
So far from where 
I intended to go 
Scavenging through life's very constant lulls 
So far from where I'm determined to go

There is no way ... 
Wish I had the charm to attract the one I love 
But you see, I've got no charm

THE LOOP

I just wanna say 
I haven't been away 
I'm still right here 
Where I always was 
So one day, if you're bored 
By all means call 
Because you can do 
(But only if you want to) 
I just wanna say 
I haven't been away 
I am still right here 
Where I always was 
So one day, when you're bored 
By all means call 
Because you can do 
But you might not get through

 

SISTER I'M A POET

All over this town 
Yes, a low wind may blow 
And I can see through everybo... 
With no reason 
To hide these words I feel 
And no reason 
To talk about the books I read 
But still I do 
That's 'cause I'm a ... Sister I'm a ... 
All over this town 
Along this way 
Outside the prison gates 
I love the romance of crime 
And I wonder 
Does anybody feel the way I do ? 
And is evil just something you are 
Or something you do ? 
Sister I'm a ... Sister I'm a ... 
All over this town, All over this town 
They pull over 
In their Citroen vans 
Not to shake your hand 
With meths on their breaths 
And you with youth on your side 
A plastic bag stranded at the lights 
This once was me ...
But now I'm a ... Sister I'm a ...
All over this town ... Oh, oh, oh 
All over this town, All over this town, Oh ... 
I still cannot speak French ... I am very lazy

 

JACK THE RIPPER

Oh, you look so tired 
Mouth slack and wide 
Ill-housed and ill-advised 
Your face is as mean 
As your life has been 
Crash into my arms 
I WANT YOU 
You don't agree -
But you don't refuse 
I know you 
And I know a place 
Where no one is likely to pass 
Oh, you don't care if it's late 
And you don't care if you're lost 
And oh, you look so tired 
(But tonight you presumed too much) 
Too much, too much 
And if it's the last 
Thing I ever do 
I'M GONNA GET YOU 
Crash into my arms 
I WANT YOU 
You don't agree -
But you don't refuse 
I know you 
And no one knows a thing about my life 
I can come and go as I please 
And if I want to, I can stay 
Oh, or if I want to, I can leave 
Nobody knows me, Nobody knows me, Nobody knows me Oh, oh...

 

SUCH A LITTLE THING MAKES SUCH A BIG DIFFERENCE

Such a little thing, such a little thing
but the difference it made was grave
there you go
wielding a bicycle chain
oh why won't you change
cange and be nicer?
such a little thing
a gentle tone of kindness
or written words on paper
- can you write?
How I love all of
the very simple things of life
(God's good air)
how I love all of
the very simple things of life
such a little thing
a fumbling politeness
the difference it saved me
wielding a bicycle chain
"I WILL NOT CHANGE AND I WILL NOT BE NICE"
Most people keep their brains between your legs (don't you find?)
Leave me alone - I was only singing, leave me alone because
I was only singing
leave me alone - I was only singing, leave me alone
you have just proved (again)
MOST PEOPLE KEEP THEIR BRAINS BETWEEN THEIR LEGS

 

I KNOW IT'S GONNA HAPPEN SOMEDAY

My love, wherever you are 
Whatever you are 
Don't lose faith 
I know it's gonna happen someday 
To you 
Please wait ...

Oh ... Wait ... 
Don't lose faith 
You say that the day just never arrives 
And it's never seemed so far away 
Still, I know it's gonna happen someday 
To you 
Please wait ... 
Don't lose faith

 

WE'LL LET YOU KNOW

How sad are we ? 
And how sad have we been ? 
We'll let you know, We'll let you know 
Oh, but only if - you're really interested 
You wonder how 
We've stayed alive 'till now 
We'll let you know, We'll let you know 
But only if - you're really interested 
We're all smiles 
Then, honest, I swear, it's the turnstiles 
That make us hostile 
Oh ... We will descend 
On anyone unable to defend 
Themselves 
Oh ... And the songs we sing 
They're not supposed to mean a thing 
La, la, la, la ... Oh ...
You're lonely, Oh ... you're lonely 
Oh ... 
GET OFF THE ROOF !
Oh ... Your Arsenal !
We may seem cold, or 
We may even be 
The most depressing people you've ever known 
At heart, what's left, we sadly know 
That we are the last truly British people you'll ever know 
We are the last truly British people you will ever know 
You'll never never want to know

 

SUEDHEAD

Why do you come here
why do you hang around
I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry
Why do you come here
when you know it makes
things hard for me
when you know, oh
why do you come?
Why do you telephone?
and why send me silly notes?
I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry
why do you come here
when you know it makes
thing hard for me
when you know, oh
why do you come?
You had to sneak into my room
'just' to read my diary
was it just to see all the things
you knew I'd written about you?
and...so many illustrations
I'm so very sickened
oh, I am so sickened NOW

 

HE KNOWS I'D LOVE TO SEE HIM

He Knows (he knows)
Or, I think he does
because when I lived
in the Arse of the world...
he knows, he knows, he knows I'd love
to see him happy (or as close as is allowed)
because when I lived
in the Arse of the world
he knows, he knows, he knows I'd love
to see him happy (or as close as possible
as close as possible, as close as is allowed)
My name still conjours up deadly deeds
and a bad taste in the mouth
the police - they actually knew me
they said:
"You're just another person in the world
you're just another fool with radical views
you're just another who has maddening views
you want to turn it on its head
by staying in bed!"
I said: "I know I do"

 

YOU'RE GONNA NEED SOMEONE ON YOUR SIDE

With the world's fate 
Resting on your shoulder

Someone on your side 
Someone kindly told me 
That you'd wasted 
Eight of nine lives
Oh, give yourself a break 
Before you break down 
You're gonna need someone on your side 
And here I am, And here I am 
Well, you don't need 
To look so pleased ! 
Day or night, 
There is no difference 
You're gonna need someone on your side 
Day or night, 
There is no difference 
You're gonna need someone soon 
And here I am, And here I am 
Well, you don't need 
To look so pleased

NOW MY HEART IS FULL

There's gonna be some trouble 
A whole house will need re-building 
And everyone I love in the house 
Will recline on an analyst's couch quite 
Soon 
Your Father cracks a joke 
And in the usual way 
Empties the room 
Tell all of my friends 
(I don't have too many 
Just some rain-coated lovers' puny brothers)
Dallow, Spicer, Pinkie, Cubitt 
Rush to danger 
Wind up nowhere 
Patric Doonan - raised to wait 
I'm tired again, I've tried again, and 
Now my heart is full 
Now my heart is full 
And I just can't explain 
So I won't even try to
Dallow, Spicer, Pinkie, Cubitt 
Every jammy Stressford poet 
Loafing oafs in all-night chemists 
Loafing oafs in all-night chemists 
Underact - express depression 
Ah, but Bunnie I loved you 
I was tired again 
I've tried again, and 
Now my heart is full 
Now my heart is full 
And I just can't explain 
So I won't even try to 
Could you pass by ? 
Could you pass by ? 
Oh ... 
Now my heart is full 
Now my heart is full 
And I just can't explain 
So ... slow ... 
Slow ... slow ... slow ... slow ... slow ...

 

SPRING-HEELED JIM

Spring-heeled Jim winks an eye 
He'll "do", he'll never be "done to" 
He takes on whoever flew through 
"Well, it's the normal thing to do" ... ah ... 
Spring-heeled Jim lives to love 
Now kissing with his mouth full 
And his eyes on some other fool 
So many women 
His head should be spinning 
Ah, but no ! 
Ah, but no ! 
But no !
Ah, no !
Spring-heeled Jim slurs the words : 
"There's no need to be so knowing
Take life at five times the 
Average speed, like I do" 
Until Jim feels the chill 
"Oh, where did all the time go ?" 
Once always in for the kill 
Now it's too cold 
And he feels too 
old 
Too old
Mmm, old... 
La, la, la, la-la, la ...

 

BILLY BUDD

Say, Billy Budd 
So you think you should ? 
Oh, everyone's laughing 
Say, Billy Budd 
So you think that you should ? 
Everyone's laughing ! 
Since I took up with you 
Things have been bad 
Yeah, but now it's 12 years on 
Now it's 12 years on 
Yes, and I took up with you 
I took my job application 
Into town 
Did you hear ? They turned me down 
Yes, and it's all because of us 
Oh, and what was in our eyes 
Oh, what was in our eyes, yeah 
I said, Billy Budd 
I would happily lose 
Both of my legs 
I would lose both of my legs 
Oh, if it meant you could be free 
Oh, if it meant you could be free 
(Don't leave us in the dark!)

 

HOLD ON TO YOUR FRIENDS

A bond of trust 
Has been abused 
Something of value 
May be lost 
Give up your job 
Squander your cash - be rash 
Just hold on to your friends 
There are more than enough 
To fight and oppose 
Why waste good time 
Fighting the people you like 
Who will fall defending your name 
Oh, don't feel so ashamed 
To have friends 
But now you only call me 
When you're feeling depressed 
When you feel happy I'm 
So far from your mind 
My patience is stretched 
My loyalty vexed 
Oh, you're losing all of your friends 
Hold on to your friends 
Hold on to your friends 
Resist - or move on 
Be mad, be rash 
Smoke and explode 
Sell all of your clothes 
Just bear in mind : 
Oh, there just might come a time 
When you need some friends

 

THE MORE YOU IGNORE ME, THE CLOSER I GET

The more you ignore me 
The closer I get 
You're wasting your time 
The more you ignore me 
The closer I get 
You're wasting your time 
I will be 
In the bar 
With my head 
On the bar 
I am now 
A central part 
Of your mind's landscape 
Whether you care 
Or do not 
Yeah, I've made up your mind 
The more you ignore me 
The closer I get 
You're wasting your time 
The more you ignore me 
The closer I get 
You're wasting your time 
Beware !
I bear more grudges 
Than lonely high court judges 
When you sleep 
I will creep 
Into your thoughts 
Like a bad debt 
That you can't pay 
Take the easy way 
And give in 
Yeah, and let me in 
Oh, let me in 
Oh let me ... 
Oh, let me in 
IT'S WAR 
IT'S WAR 
WAR 
WAR 
Oh, let me in 
Ah, the closer I get 
Ah, you're asking for it 
Ah, the closer I get 
Ooh, the closer I ...

 

WHY DON'T YOU FIND OUT FOR YOURSELF

The sanest days are mad 
Why don't you find out for yourself ? 
Then you'll see the price 
Very closely 
Some men here 
They have a special interest 
In your career 
They wanna help you to grow 
And then syphon all your dough 
Why don't you find out for yourself ? 
Then you'll see the glass 
Hidden in the grass 
You'll never believe me, so 
Why don't you find out for yourself ? 
Sick down to my heart 
That's just the way it goes 
Some men here 
They know the full extent of 
Your distress 
They kneel and pray 
And they say : 
"Long may it last" 
Why don't you find out for yourself ?
Then you'll see the glass 
Hidden in the grass 
Bad scenes come and go 
For which you must allow 
Sick down to my heart 
That's just the way it goes 
Don't rake up my mistakes 
I know exactly what they are 
And ... what do YOU do ? 
Well ... you just SIT THERE 
I've been stabbed in the back 
So many many times 
I don't have any skin 
But that's just the way it goes

 

I AM HATED FOR LOVING

I am hated for loving 
I am hated for loving 
Anonymous call, a poison pen 
A brick in the small of the back again 
I still don't belong 
To anyone - I am mine 
And I am hated for loving 
I am haunted for wanting 
Anonymous call, a poison pen 
A brick in the ... ah ... 
A brick in the small of the back again 
I still don't belong 
To anyone - I am mine 
I am falling 
With no-one to catch me 
I am falling 
And there's still 
No-one to catch me 
Ah .. 
Anonymous call, a poison pen 
A brick in the ... ah ... 
A brick in the small of the back again 
I just don't belong 
To anywhere 
I just don't belong 
Mmm ... 
Ah ...

 

LIFEGUARD SLEEPING, GIRL DROWNING

Always looking for attention 
Always needs to be mentioned 
Who does she 
Think she should be ? 
The shrill cry through darkening air 
Doesn't she know he's 
Had such a busy day ? 
Tell her ... sshhh
Somebody tell her ... sshhh 
Slowest ... 
It was only a test 
But she swam too far 
Against the tide 
She deserves all she gets 
The sky became marked with stars 
As an out-stretched arm slowly 
Disappears 
Hooray 
Oh hooray 
No, oh, oh, woh, there's no movement 
No, oh, hooray 
Oh, hooray 
Please don't worry 
There'll be no fuss 
She was ... nobody's nothing 
(What's your name ?) 
When he awoke 
The sea was calm 
And another day passes like a dream 
There's no ... no way 
(What's your name ?)

 

USED TO BE A SWEET BOY

Used to be a sweet boy 
Holding so tightly 
To Daddy's hand 
But that was all 
In some distant land 
Blazer and tie 
And a big bright healthy smile 
Used to make all 
Of our trials worthwhile 
Used to be a sweet boy 
And I'm not to blame 
Something went wrong 
And I know 
I'm not to blame 
Something went wrong 
Can't be to blame 
Ah ...

 

THE LAZY SUNBATHERS

A world war 
Was announced 
Days ago 
But they didn't know 
The lazy sunbathers 
The lazy sunbathers 
The sun burns through 
To the planet's core 
And it isn't enough 
They want more 
Nothing 
Appears 
To be 
Between the ears of 
The lazy sunbathers 
Too jaded 
To question stagnation 
The sun burns through 
To the planet's core 
And it isn't enough 
They want more 
Religions fall 
Children shelled 
"...Children shelled ? That's all 
Very well, but would you 
Please keep the noise 
Down low ? 
Because you're waking 
The lazy sunbathers ..."
Oh, the lazy sunbathers 
The lazy sunbathers

 

SPEEDWAY

And when you slam 
Down the hammer 
Can you see it in your heart ? 
All of the rumours 
Keeping me grounded 
I never said, I never said that they were 
Completely unfounded 
So when you slam 
Down the hammer 
Can you see it in your heart ? 
Can you delve so low ? 
And when you're standing 
On my fingers 
Can you see it in your heart ? ... ah ... 
And when you try 
To break my spirit 
It won't work 
Because there's nothing left to break 
Anymore 
All of the rumours 
Keeping me grounded 
I never said, I never said that they were 
Completely unfounded 
You won't sleep 
Until the earth that wants me 
Finally has me 
Oh you've done it now 
You won't rest 
Until the hearse that becomes me 
Finally takes me 
Oh you've done it now 
And you won't smile 
Until my loving mouth 
Is shut good and proper 
FOREVER 
All of the rumours 
Keeping me grounded 
I never said, I never said that they were 
Completely unfounded 
And all those lies 
Written lies, twisted lies 
Well, they weren't lies 
They weren't lies 
They weren't lies 
I never said 
I never said 
I could have mentioned your name 
I could have dragged you in 
Guilt by implication 
By association 
I've always been true to you 
In my own strange way 
I've always been true to you 
In my own sick way 
I'll always stay true to you

 

THE TEACHERS ARE AFRAID OF THE PUPILS

There's too many people 
Planning your downfall 
When your spirit's on trial 
These nights can be frightening 
Sleep transports sadness 
To some other mid-brain 
And somebody here 
Will not be here next year 
So you stand by the board 
Full of fear and intention 
And, if you think that they're listening 
Well, you've got to be joking 
Oh, you understand change 
And you think it's essential 
But when your profession 
Is humiliation 
Say the wrong word to our children ...
We'll have you, oh yes, we'll have you 
Lay a hand on our children 
And it's never too late to have you 
Mucus on your collar 
A nail up through the staff chair 
A blade in your soap 
And you cry into your pillow 
To be finished would be a relief 
To be finished would be a relief... 
Say the wrong word to our children ...
We'll have you, oh yes, we'll have you 
Lay a hand on our children 
And it's never too late to have you 
To be finished would be a relief 
To be finished would be a relief...
I'm very glad this thing has come 
Sometimes I'm so glad 
Never bother to play the tunes 
I've seen it coming for dear life

 

READER MEET AUTHOR

You don't know a thing about their lives 
They live where you wouldn't dare to drive
You shake as you think of how they sleep 
But you write as if you are my side-by-side 
Reader, meet Author 
With the hope of hearing sense 
But you may be feeling let down 
By the words of defence 
He says : "No-one ever sees me when I cry"
You don't know a thing about their lives 
Books don't save them, books aren't Stanley knives 
And if a fight broke out here tonight 
You'd be the first away, because you're that type 
And the Year 2000 won't change anyone here 
As each fabled promise flies so fast 
You'll swear it was never there 
Oh, have you ever escaped from a shipwrecked life ? 
So safely with your software; all miles from the front line 
You hear the way their sad voices, and you start to imagine things 
Oh, any excuse to write more lies

THE OPERATION

You fight with your right hand 
And caress with your left hand 
Everyone I know is sick to death of you 
With a tear that's a mile wide 
In the kite that you're flying 
Everyone I know is sick to death of you 
Ever since 
You don't look the same 
You're just not the same, no way 
You say clever things and 
You never used to 
You don't catch what I'm saying 
When you're deafened to advice 
Everyone here is sick to the 
Back teeth of you 
With a tear that's a mile wide 
In the kite that you're flying 
Everyone here is sick to the 
Tattoo of you 
Ever since 
You don't look the same 
You're just not the same, no way 
You say pleasant things and 
There is no need to
Still, you fight with your right hand 
And caress with your left hand 
Ooh, ooh ... Sad to say ... 
How once I was in love with you 
Sad to say ... 
You don't catch what I'm saying 
When you're deafened to advice 
Ooh, ooh ... Ever since 
You don't look the same 
You're just not the same, no way 
What the hell have 
They stuck into you ?

 

DAGENHAM DAVE

Head in the clouds, and a mouthful of pie 
Head in a blouse, everybody loves him 
I see why 
Dagenham Dave, Dagenham Dave, Oh, Dagenham Dave 
Dagenham Dave, Dagenham Dave, Oh, Dagenham Dave 
"I love Karen, I love Sharon" on the windowscreen 
With never the need to fight or to question a single thing 
Dagenham Dave, Dagenham Dave Oh, Dagenham Dave 
Dagenham Dave, Dagenham Dave Oh, Dagenham Dave ...
He'd love to touch, he's afraid that he might self-combust 
I could say more, but you get the general idea 
Dagenham Dave, Dagenham Dave Dagenham Dave, Dagenham Dave 
Dagenham, Dagenham Dagenham Dave, Dagenham Dave ...
Oh, Dave, oh, Dagenham, dagenham, Oh, Dave, oh, Dave, ...

 

DO YOUR BEST AND DON'T WORRY

Compare the best of their days 
With the worst of your days 
You won't win 
With your standards so high 
And your spirits so low 
At least remember ... 
This is you on a bad day, you on a pale day 
Just do your best and don't ... Don't worry, oh 
The way you hang yourself is oh, so unfair 
See the best of how they look 
Against the worst of how you are
And again, you won't win 
With your standards so high 
And your spirits so low 
At least remember ... 
This is you on a drab day, you in a drab dress 
Just do your best and don't ... Don't worry, oh 
The way you hang yourself is oh, so unfair 
Just do your best and don't ... Don't worry, oh 
The way you watch yourself is oh, so unfair 
Just do your best and don't ... Don't worry, oh 
Do your best and don't ...

SOUTHPAW

You were a boy before you became a man 
I don't see the joy 
And you ran with your pals in the sun 
You turned around and they were gone 
Again ... 
A sick boy should be treated 
So easily defeated 
Oh, I just don't understand 
So you ran with your pals in the sun 
You turned around 
You were alone 
Again ... 
And you ran back to Ma 
Which set the pace for the rest of your days 
Oh, you ran back to Ma 
Which set the pace for the rest of your days 
Oh, you ran back to Ma 
Which set the pace for the rest of your days 
And now, there is something that you should know 
There is something that you should know 
The girl of your dreams is 
Here all alone 
Girl of your dreams is 
Here all alone 
The girl of your dreams is 
Sad and all alone 
The girl of your dreams is 
Here all alone 
There is something that you should know

Girl of your dreams is 
Here all alone 
The girl of your dreams is 
Sad and is all alone 
The girl of your dreams is 
Sad and is feeling all alone 
Oh, there is something that you should know 
Help me, help me, help me ...

 

MALADJUSTED

I wanna start from 
Before the beginning 
Loot wine, "Be mine, and 
Then let's stay out for the night"
Ride via Parkside 
Semi-perilous lives 
Jeer the lights in the windows 
Of all safe and stable homes 
(But wondering then, well what 
Could peace of mind be like ?)
Anyway do you want to hear 
Our story, or not ? 
As the Fulham Road lights 
Stretch and invite into the night 
From a Stevenage overspill 
We'd kill to live around 
SW6 - with someone like you 
Keep thieves' hours 
With someone like you 
...As long as it slides 
You stalk the house 
In a low-cut blouse : 
"Oh Christ, another stifled 
Friday night !"
And the Fulham Road lights 
Stretch and invite into the night 
Well, I was fifteen 
What could I know ?
When the gulf between 
All the things I need 
And the things I receive 
Is an ancient ocean 
Wide, wild, lost, uncrossed 
Still I maintain there's nothing 
Wrong with you 
You do all that you do 
Because it's all you can do 
Well, I was fifteen 
Where could I go ?
With a soul full of loathing 
For stinging bureaucracy 
Making it anything 
Other than easy 
For working girls like me 
With my hands on my head 
I flop on your bed 
With a head full of dread 
For all I've ever said 
Maladjusted, maladjusted 
Maladjusted maladjusted 
Never to be trusted 
Oh, never to be trusted 
There's nothing wrong with you, oh 
...There's nothing wrong with you

 

ALMA MATTERS

So : the choice I have made 
May seem strange to you 
But who asked you, anyway ? 
It's my life to wreck 
My own way 
You see : to someone, somewhere, oh yeah ... 
Alma matters 
In mind, body and soul 
In part, and in whole 
Because to someone, somewhere, oh yeah ... 
Alma matters 
In mind, body and soul 
In part, and in whole 
So the life I have made 
May seem wrong to you 
But, I've never been surer 
It's my life to ruin 
My own way 
You see : to someone, somewhere, oh yeah ... 
Alma matters 
In mind, body and soul 
In part, and in whole 
Because to someone, somewhere, oh yeah ... 
Alma matters 
In mind, body and soul 
In part, and in whole 
To someone, somewhere, oh yeah ... 
Alma matters 
In mind, body and soul 
Part, and in whole 
So to someone, somewhere, oh yeah ... 
Alma matters 
In mind, body and soul 
Part, and in whole 
To someone, somewhere, oh yeah ... 
Oh yeah ... Oh yeah, oh yeah Oh yeah ...

 

AMBITIOUS OUTSIDERS

Bolt-lock your doors 
Alarm your cars 
And still we move in closer 
Every day 
Top of the list 
Is your smiling kids 
But we'll be smiling too 
So that's OK 
Oh, and by the way 
Thank you, because you're 
Giving, giving, giving 
And we're receiving - 
No, no, we're taking 
Keeping the population down 
Your taxes paid, but 
Police waylaid 
And we knows 
When the school bus 
Comes and goes 
We're on your street, but 
You don't see us 
Or, if you do 
You smile and say Hello 
BUT DON'T UNDERESTIMATE US 
When you are 
Giving, giving, giving 
And we're receiving - 
No, no, we're taking 
Just keeping 
The population down 
You're giving, giving, giving 
Well, it's your own fault 
For reproducing 
We're just keeping 
The population down

 

TROUBLE LOVES ME

Trouble loves me 
Trouble needs me 
Two things 
More than you do 
Or would attempt to 
So, console me 
Otherwise, hold me 
Just when it seems like 
Everything's evened out 
And the balance 
Seems serene 
Trouble loves me 
Walks beside me 
To chide me 
Not to guide me 
It's still much more 
Than you'll do 
So, console me 
Otherwise, hold me 
Just when it seems like 
Everything's evened out 
And the balance seems serene 
See the fool I'll be 
Still running 'round 
On the flesh rampage 
Still running 'round 
Ready with ready-wit 
Still running 'round 
On the flesh rampage 
- At your age ! 
Go to Soho, oh 
Go to waste in 
The wrong arms 
Still running 'round 
Trouble loves me 
Seeks and finds me 
To charlatanize me 
Which is only 
As it should be 
Oh, please fulfill me 
Otherwise, kill me 
Show me a barrel and watch me scrape it 
Faced with the music, as always I'll face it 
In the half-light 
So English, frowning 
Then at midnight I 
Can't get you out of my head 
A disenchanted taste 
Still running 'round 
A disenchanted taste 
Still running 'round

 

PAPA JACK

Papa Jack 
Wants to turn 
Back the clock 
And reach out 
To the kids 
He once had 
Who have flown 
Papa Jack 
In decline 
Feels inclined 
To reach out 
To the kids 
He once had 
Who have flown 
But there was a time 
When the kids reached up 
And Papa Jack just 
Pushed them away 
Looking deep 
In his heart 
Papa Jack 
Doesn't like 
What he sees 
Or the time 
On his hands 
The dying day 
The chilly sun 
Papa Jack 
All alone 
Sings slow 
Grieving and low 
But there was a time 
When the kids reached up 
Now you can't always 
Have it your way 
Papa Jack 
Ah ...

 

AMMUNITION

I know these roads 
Each ridge 
And narrow bridge 
Each cheveron 
Enticing me on 
Each warning sign 
I take in my stride 
I don't need more ammunition 
I've got more than I can spend 
I don't dwell on things I'm missing 
I'm just pleased 
With the things I've found 
I know these roads 
An old hand understands 
Above all, I know what's 
Expected of me now 
Veering cliffwards 
I don't need more ammunition 
I've got more than I can spend 
I don't dwell on things I'm missing 
I'm just pleased 
With the things I've found 
With the things I've found 
With the things I've found 
I've found 
I've been crying 
It comes back on these salient days 
And it stays 
And it says : 
"We've never really been away" 
I don't need more ammunition 
I've got more than I can spend 
I don't think of who I'm missing 
I've got no space and no time 
In my life, anymore 
No space or time 
In my life, anymore 
For Revenge

 

WIDE TO RECEIVE

Download something 
Useful, or useless 
Because I'm lying here 
Wide to receive 
Almost anything 
You'd care to give 
And I don't 
Get along with myself 
And I'm not too keen 
On anyone else 
Turn on, plug in 
Then just walk away 
Unlock, process 
And then just go 
And I've never felt quite so alone 
As I do right now 
I'm lying here 
Wide to receive 
Almost anything 
You'd care to leave 
Wide, wide, wide Wide, wide, wide...

 

ROY'S KEEN

(GO ON !)
He's romancing you 
And chancing his arm 
He'll be here 
Smiling on time 
He's romancing you 
And chancing his arm 
He'll be here 
Smiling on time 
Roy's keen oh Roy's keen 
Roy's keen oh Roy's keen 
We've never seen a 
Keener window-cleaner 
Back up the ladder 
Into each corner 
Dunking the chamois 
Just think of the goodwill 
The ladder's a planet 
Roy is a star, and 
I am a satellite 
(But that's alright) 
He can hold a smile for as long 
As you require (even longer) 
He can hold a smile for as long 
As you require (even longer) 
Roy's keen oh Roy's keen 
Roy's keen oh Roy's keen 
We've never seen a 
Keener window-cleaner 
Back up the ladder 
Into each corner 
Dunking the chamois 
Just think of the goodwill 
The ladder's a planet 
Roy is a star, and 
I am a satellite 
I will be set alight 
Don't say you'll hold it steady 
Then you let it go 
Don't say you'll hold it steady 
Then you let it go Oh ...
You're up the ladder 
Into each corner 
Foot in a bucket 
We trust you to wreck it 
Even when it's under your nose 
Well, you just can't 
See it, can you ? 
Well, it's here 
Right under your nose 
And you just can't 
See it, can you? La la la la ...
Roy's keen, Roy's keen La la la la ...
We've never seen a 
Keener window-cleaner 
Oh ... La la la la ...

 

HE CRIED

I need you 
Simple words 
But words which had never been heard 
By the soul 
Stoned to death 
But still living 
And so he froze where he stood 
And he looked to the ground 
And he cried 
He cried 
Ride our minds 
If you must 
But there's always a line you don't cross 
Time is short 
Don't be cruel 
Oh you don't know the power 
In what you're saying 
Oh ... 
And so he froze where he stood 
And he looked to the ground 
And he cried 
He cried 
People where 
I come from 
They survive without feelings or blood 
I never could 
Was stoned to death 
But I'm still living 
So he froze where he stood 
And he looked to the ground 
And he cried 
He cried 
So he froze 
And he looked, and he looked 
To the ground 
And he cried 
He cried

 

SORROW WILL COME IN THE END

Legalized theft 
Leaves me bereft 
I get it straight in the neck 
(Somehow expecting no less) 
A court of justice 
With no use for Truth 
Lawyer ...liar 
Lawyer ...liar 
You pleaded and squealed 
And you think you've won 
But Sorrow will come 
To you in the end 
And as sure as my words are pure 
I praise the day that brings you pain 
Q.C.'s obsessed with sleaze 
Frantic for Fame 
They're all on the game 
They just use a different name 
You lied 
And you were believed 
By a J.P. senile and vile 
You pleaded and squealed 
And you think you've won 
But Sorrow will come 
To you in the end 
And as sure as my words are pure 
I praise the day that brings you pain 
So don't close your eyes 
Don't close your eyes 
A man who slits throats 
Has time on his hands 
And I'm gonna get you 
So don't close your eyes 
Don't ever close your eyes 
You think you've won 
OH NO

 

SATAN REJECTED MY SOUL

Satan rejected my soul 
He knows my kind 
He won't be dragged down 
He's seen my face around 
He knows Heaven doesn't seem 
To be my home 
So I must find 
Somewhere else to go 
So I must find 
Somewhere else to go 
So, take it - please 
It's free 
You'll never see 
You'll never see 
All the fun in life it's cost me 
Satan rejected my soul 
As low as he goes 
He never quite goes this low 
He's seen my face around 
He knows Heaven doesn't seem 
To be my home 
So I must find 
Somewhere else to go 
So I must find 
Somewhere else to go 
So, take it please 
It's really sly 
Come on, come on, ah Come on, come on, come on 
Take it please, It's really sly 
Come on, come on, ah Come on, come on, come on 
Call me in, Pull me in, call me in 
Come on, come on, oh Come on, come on, come on 
Pull me in, pull me in, Call me in, haul me in, pull me in 
Come on, come on, ah, Come on, come on 
La la la la la, Oh ...

 
 REEL AROUND THE FOUNTAIN

It's time the tale was told
of how you took a child
and you made him old
Reel around the fountain
slap me on the patio
I'll take it now
Fifteen minutes with you
well, I wouldn't say no
people said that you were virtually dead
and they were so wrong
fifteen minutes with you
well, i wouldn't say no
people said that you were easily led
and they were half-right
I dreamt about you last night
and i fell out of bed twice
you can pin and mount me like a butterfly
but take me to the haven of your bed
was something that you never said
two lumps, please
you're the bee's knees
but so am I
Meet me at the fountain
shove me on the patio
I'll take it slowly
Fifteen minutes with you
oh I wouldn't say no
people see no worth in you
oh but I do

 

YOU'VE GOT EVERYTHING NOW

As merry as the days were long
I was right and you were wrong
back at the old grey school
I would win and you would lose
But you've got everything now
and what a terrible mess I've made of my life
No, I've never had a job
because I've never wanted one
I've seen you smile
but I've never really heard you laugh
So who is rich and who is poor?
I cannot say...
You are your mother's only son
and you're a desperate one
But I don't want a lover
I just want to be seen in the back of your car
A friendship sadly lost?
Well, this is true ...and yet, it's false
Did I ever tell you , by the way
I never did like your face
But you've got everything now
and what a terrible mess I've made of my life
No, I've never had a job
because I'm too shy
But I don't want a lover
I just want to be tied to the back of your car.

 

MISERABLE LIE

So, goodbye
please stay with your own kind
and I'll stay with mine
There's something against us
it's not time
So, goodbye
I know I hardly say
how much I love your casual way
but please put your tongue away
a little higher and we're well away
the dark nights are drawing in
and your humour is as black as them
I look at yours, you laugh at mine
and"love" is just a miserable lie
you have destroyed my flower like-life
not once-but twice
you have corrupt my innocent mind
not once-but twice
I know that wind-swept mystical air
it means: I'd like to see your underwear
I recognise that mystical air
it means: I'd like to see your underwear
what do we get for the trouble and pain?
just a rented room in Whalley Range
into the depths of the criminal world
I followed her...
I need advice, I need advice
because nobody ever looks at me twice
I'm just a country-mile behind
the world
I'm just a country mile behind
the whole world
so take me when you go

 

PRETTY GIRLS MAKE GRAVES

Upon the sand,upon the bay
"there is a quick and easy way" you say
before you illustrate
I'd rather state:
"I'm not the man you think I am
I'm not the man you think I am "
And Sorrow's native son
he will not smile for anyone
And pretty girls makes the graves
End of the pier, end of the bay
you tug my arm and say:"Give into lust,
give up to lust, oh heaven knows we'll
soon be dust..."
But I'm not the man you think I am
I'm not the man you think I am
And Sorrow's native son
he will not rise for anyone
And pretty girls make graves
I could have been wild and I could have been free
but Nature played this trick on me
She wants it Now
and she will not wait
but she's too rough
and I'm too delicate
Then on the sand
another man, he takes her hand
and a smile lights up her stupid face
(and well, it would)
I lost my faith in Womanhood
I lost my faith in Womanhood, I lost my faith

 

THE HAND THAT ROCKS THE CRADLE

Please don't cry
the ghost and the storm outside
will not invade this sacred shire
nor infiltrate your mind
my life down I shall lie
if the bogey-man should try
to play tricks on your sacred mind
to tease, torment and tantalise
wavering shadows loom
a piano plays in an empty room
there'll be blood on the cleaver tonight
when darkness lifts and the room is bright
I'll still be by your side
for you are all that matters
and I'll love you till the day I die
there never need to be longing in your eyes
as long as the hand that rocks the cradle is mine
ceiling shadows shimmy by
and when the wardrobe towers like a beast of prey
there's a sadness in your beautiful eyes
you're untouched, unsoiled, wonderous eyes
my life down I shall lie
should restless spirts try
to play tricks on you sacred mind
but whom I never gave a name
I just looked into his wonderous eyes
and said" never never never again"
all too soon I did return
just like a moth to a flame
so rattle my bones all over the stones
because I'm only a beggar-man whom nobody owns
see how words as old as sin
fit me like a glove I'm here and here I'll stay
together we lie, together we pray
there never need be longing in your eyes
as long as the hand that rocks the cradle is mine

 

STILL ILL

I decree today that life
is simply taking and not giving
England is mine and it owes me a living
ask me why, and I'll spit in your eye
ask me why, and I'll spit in your eye
but we cannot cling to the old dreams anymore
no, we cannot cling to the old dreams anymore
Does the body rule the mind
or does the mind rule the body?
I dunno...
Under the iron bridge we kissed
and although I ended up with sore lips
it just wasn't like the old days anymore
no, it wasn't like those days
am I still ill?
Does the body rule the mind
or does the mind rule the body ?
I dunno...
Ask me why, and I'll die
ask me why, and I'll die
and if you must go to work tomorrow
well, if I were you I wouldn't bother
for there are brighter sides to life
and I should know because I've seen them
but not very often...
under the iron bridge we kissed
and although I ended up with sore lips
it just wasn't like the old days anymore
no, it wasn't like those days
am I still ill?

 

HAND IN GLOVE

Hand in glove
the sun shines out of our behinds
no, it's not like any other love
this one is different-because it's us
Hand in glove
we can go wherever we please
and everything depends upon
how near you stand to me
And if the people stare
then the people stare
I really don't know and I really don't care
Hand in glove
the Good People laugh
yes, we may be hidden by rags
but we have something they'll never have
So, hand in glove I stake my claim
I'll fight to the last breath
If they dare touch a hair on your head
I'll fight to the last breath
The Good Life is out there, somewhere
so stay on my arm, you little charmer
But I know my luck too well
and I'll probably never see you again.

 

WHAT DIFFERENCE DOES IT MAKE?

All men have secrets and here is mine
so let it be known
we have been through hell and high tide,
I can surely rely on you?
and yet you start to recoil,
heavy words are so lightly thrown
but still I'd leap in front of a flying bullet for you
So, what difference does it make?
so, what difference does it make?
it makes none
but you have gone
and you must be looking very old tonight
The devil will find work for idle hands to do
I stole and I lied, and why?
because you asked me to!
but now you make feel so ashamed
because I've only got two hands
well, I'm still fond of you
So, what difference does it make?
so, what difference does it make?
it makes none
but you have gone
and your prejudice won't keep you warm tonight
So, no more apologies
no more apologies
I'm too tired
I'm too sick and tired
and I'm feeling very sick and ill today
But I'm still fond of you

 

I DON'T OWE YOU ANYTHING

Bought on stolen wine
a nod was the first step
you know very well
what was coming next
did I really walk all this way
just to hear you say
"oh I don't want to go out tonight"
but you will
for you must
I don't owe you anything
but you owe me something
repay me now
you should never go to them
let them come to you
just like I do
you should not go to them
let them come to you
just like I do
Too freely on your lips
words prematurely said
oh but I know what will make you smile tonight
Life is never kind
life is never kind
oh but I know what will make you smile tonight

 

SUFFER LITTLE CHILDREN

Over the moors,take me to the moors
dig a shallow grave
and I'll lay me down
Lesley-Anne, with your pretty white beads
oh John, you'll never be a man
and you'll never see your home again
oh Manchester, so much to answer for
Edward, see those alluring lights?
tonight will be your very last night
a woman said "I know my son is dead
I'll never rest my hands on his scared head"
Hindley wakes and Hindley says:
"Wherever he has gone, I have gone "
But fresh lilaced moorland fields
cannot hide the stoild stench of death
Hindley wakes and Hindley says:
"Whatever he has done, I have done"
But this is no easy ride
for a child cries
"find me...find me, nothing more
we're on a sullen misty moor
we may be dead and we may be gone
but we will be right by your side
until the day you die
this is no easy ride
we will haunt you when you laugh
yes, you could say we're a team
you might sleep
BUT YOU WILL NEVER DREAM!"
Oh Manchester, so much to answer for
Oh Manchester, so much to answer for
Over the moor, I'm on the moor
the child is on the moor

 

THE HEADMASTER RITUAL

Belligerent ghouls
run Manchester schools
spineless swines
cemented mines
Sir leads the troops
jealous of youth
same old suit since 1962
he does the military two-step
down the nape of my neck
I wanna go home
I don't want to stay
give up education
is a bad mistake
mid-week on the playing fields
Sir thwacks you on the knees
knees you in the groin
elbow in the face
I wanna go home
I don't want to stay
Belligerent ghouls
run Manchester schools
spineless bastards all
Sir leads the troops
jealous of youth
same old jokes since 1902
he does the military two-step
down the nape of my neck
I wanna go home
I don't want to stay
give up life
as a bad mistake
please excuse me from gym
I've got this terrible cold coming on
he grabs and devours
he kicks me in the showers
kicks me in the showers
and he grabs and devours
I wanna go home
I don't want to stay

 

RUSHOLME RUFFIANS

The last night at the fair
by the big wheel generator
a boy is stabbed
and his money is grabbed
and the air hangs heavy like a dulling wine
she is famous
she is funny
an engagement ring
doesn't mean a thing
to a mind consumed by brass(money)
and though I walk home alone
my faith in love is still devout
the last night at the fair
from a seat on a whirling waltzer
her skirt ascends for a watching eye
it's a hideous trait( on her mother's side)
and though I walk home alone
my faith in love is still devout
then someone falls in love
and someone's beaten up
and the senses being dulled are mine
and someone falls in love
someone's beaten up
and the senses being dulled are mine
and though I walk home alone
my faith in love is still devout
this is the last night of the fair
and the grease in the hair
of a speedway operator
is all a tremulous heart requires
a schoolgirl is denied
she said "How quickly would I die
if I jumped from the top of the parachutes?"
this is the last night of the fair

scratch my name on your arm with a fountain pen

I WANT THE ONE I CAN'T HAVE

On the day that your mentality
catches up with your biology
I want the one I can't have
and it's driving me mad
it's written all over my face
A double-bed
and a stalwart lover, for sure
these are the riches of the poor
A double-bed
and a stalwart lover, for sure
these are the riches of the poor
a tough kid who sometimes swallows nails
raised on Prisoner's Aid
he killed a policeman when he was thirteen
and somehow that really impressed me
it's written all over my face
On the day that your mentality
catches up with your biology
And if you ever need self-validation
just meet me in the alley by the
railway-station
it's written all over my face

 

WHAT SHE SAID

What she said:
"How come someone hasn't noticed
that I'm dead
and decided to bury me
God knows, I'm ready"
What she said was
but then, all the rejection she's had
to pretend to be happy
could only be idiocy
What she said was not for the job or
lover that she never had
What she read
all heady books
she'd sit and prophesise
(it took a tattoed boy from Birkenhead
to really really open her eyes)

THAT JOKE ISN'T FUNNY ANYMORE

Park the car at the side of the road
you should know
time's tide will smother you
and I will too
when you laugh about other people who feel so
very lonely
their only desire is to die
well I'm afraid
it doesn't make me smile
I wish I could laugh
but that joke isn't funny anymore
it's too close to home and it's too near the bone
it's too close to home and it's too near the bone
more than you'll ever know
It was dark as I drove the point home
and on cold leather seats
well, it suddenly struck me
I just might die with a smile on my
face after all
I've seen this happen in other people's lives
and now it's happening in mine

 

NOWHERE FAST

I'd like to drop my trousers to the world
I am a man of means(of slender means)
each household appliance
is like a new science in my town
and if a day came when I felt a natural emotion
I'd get such a shock I'd probably jump in the ocean
and when a train goes by
it's such a sad sound
I'd like to drop my trousers to the Queen
every sensible child will know what this means
the poor and the needy
are selfish and greedy on her terms
and if the day came when I felt a natural emotion
I'd get such a shock I'd probably jump in the ocean
and when a train goes by
it's such a sad song
And when I'm lying in my bed
I think about life
and I think about death
and neither one particularly appeals to me
and if the day came when I felt a natural emotion
I'd get such a shock I'd probably lie
in the middle of the street and die
I'd lie down and die

 

WELL I WONDER

Well I wonder
do you hear me when you sleep?
I hoarsely cry
Well I wonder
do you see me when we pass?
I half-die
Please keep me in mind
please keep me in mind
Gasping-but somehow still alive
this is the fierce last stand of all I am
Gasping-dying-but somehow still alive
this is the final stand of all I am
Please keep me in mind

 

BARBARISM BEGINS AT HOME

Unruly boys
who will not grow up
must be taken in hand
Unruly girls
who will not settle down
they must be taken in hand
A crack on the head
is what you get for not asking
and a crack on the head
is what you get for asking

 

MEAT IS MURDER

Heifer whines could be human cries
closer comes the screaming knife
this beautiful creature must die
this beautiful creature must die
a death for no reason
and death for reason is MURDER
and the flesh you so fancifully fry
is not succulent, tasty or nice
it's death for no reason
and death for no reason is MURDER
and the calf that you carve with a smile
is MURDER
and the turkey you festively slice
is MURDER
do you know how animals die?
kitchen aroma aren't very homely
it's not "comforting," "cheery" or kind
it's sizzling blood and the unholy stench
of MURDER
it's not "natural," "normal" or kind
the fleas you so fancifully fry
as you savour the flavour
of MURDER
NO, NO, NO, IT'S MURDER
NO, NO, NO, IT'S MURDER
who hears when animals cry?

 

THE QUEEN IS DEAD

Farewell to this lands cheerless marches
hemmed in like a boar between arches
her very Lowness with her head in a sling
Im truely sorry-but it sounds like a wonderful thing
dear Charles, dont you ever crave
to appear on the front of the Daily mail
dressed in your Mother's bridal veil?
So, I checked all the registered historical facts
and I was shocked into shame to discover
how Im the 18th pale descendent
of some, old queen or other
has the world changed, or have I changed?
has the world changed, or have I changed?
as some 9-year old tough peddles drugs
(I never even knew what drugs were)
And so, I broke into the Palace
with a sponge and a rusty spanner
she said: "Eh, I know you, and you cannot sing"
I said: "that's nothing -you should hear me play piano"
We can go for a walk where it's quiet and dry
and we can talk about precious things
but when you are tied to your mother's apron
not one talks about castration
We can go for a walk where it's quiet and dry
and we can talk about precious things
like love and law and poverty
these are the things that kill me
We can go for a walk where it's quiet and dry
and we can talk about precious things
but the rain that flattens my hair
theses are the things that kill me
Passed the Pub that saps your body
and the church who'll snatch your money
the Queen is dead, boys
and it's so lonely on a limb
Pass the Pub that wrecks your body
and the church-all they want is your money
the Queen is dead, boys`
you can trust me, boys
life is very long, when you're lonely
life is very long, when you're lonely...

 

FRANKLY MR.SHANKLY

Frankly, Mr Shankly, this position Ive held
it pays my way, but it corrodes my soul
I want to leave you will not miss me
I want to go down in musical history
Frankly, Mr Shankly, Im a sickening wreck
Ive got the 21st Century breathing down my neck
I must move fast, you understand me
I want to go down in celluloid history
Fame, Fame, fatal Fame
it can play hideous tricks on the brain
but still I rather be Famous
than righteous or holy, any day
but sometimes Id feel more fulfilled
making Christmas cards with the mentally ill
I want to Live and I want to Love
I want to catch something that I might be ashamed of
Frankly, Mr Shankly, this position I've held
it pays my way and it corrodes my soul
oh, I didnt realise that you wrote poetry
(I didnt realise you wrote such bloody awful poetry)
Frankly, Mr Shankly, since you ask
you are a flatulent pain the arse
I do not mean to be so rude
but still, I must speck frankly, Mr Shankly

 

I KNOW IT'S ALL OVER

Oh Mother, I can fell the soil falling over my head
and as i climb into an empty bed
Oh well, Enough said
I know it's over-still I cling
I don't know where else I can go
Oh Mother, I can feel the soil falling over my head
see, the sea want s to take me
the knife wants to cut me
do you think you can help me?
Sad veiled bride, please be happy
handsome groom, give her room
loud, loutish lover, treat her kindly
(although she needs you
more than she loves you)
and I know it's over
and it never really began
but in my heart it was so real
and you even spoke to me and said:
"If you're so funny
then why are you on your own tonight?
and if you are so clever
then why are you on your own tonight?
if you're so terribly good looking
then why do you sleep alone tonight?
because tonight is just like any other night
that's why you're on your own tonight
with your triumphs and your charms
while they are in each other's arms.."
It's so easy to laugh
it's so easy to hate
it takes strength to be gentle and kind
It's so easy to laugh
it's so easy to hate
it takes guts to be gentle and kind
love is Natural and Real
but not for you, my love
not tonight my love
love is Natural and Real
but not for such as you and I, my love
Oh Mother, I can fell the soil falling over my head
Oh Mother, I can fell the soil falling over my head...

 

NEVER HAD NO ONE EVER

When you walk without ease
on these
the very streets where you were raised
I had a really bad dream
it lasted 20 years, 7 months, and 27 days
Never had no one ever.

 

CEMETERY GATES

A dreaded sunny day
so I meet you at the cemetry gates
Keats and Yeats are on your side
A dreaded sunny day
so I meet you at the cemetry gates
Keats and Yeats are on your side
while Wilde is on mine
So we go inside and we gravely read the stones
all those people all those lives
where are they now ?
with loves, and hates
and passions just like mine
they were born
and then they lived and then they died
which seems so unfair
and I wantr to crv
You say: "ere thrice the sun hath done salutation to the dawn"
and you claim these words as your own
but Im well-read, have heard them said
a hundred times (maybe less, maybe more)
if you must write prose/poems
the words you use should be your own
dont plagiarise or take "on loans"
there's alweays someone, somewhere
with a big nose, who knows
and who trips you up and laughs
when you fall
You say: "ere long done do does did "
words which could only be your own
you then produce the text
from whence was ripped
(some dizzy whore, 1804)
A dreaded sunny day
so let's go where we're happy
so I meet you at the cemetry gates
Keats and Yeats are on your side
A dreaded sunny day
so let's go where we're wanted
so I meet you at the cemetry gates
Keats and Yeats are on your side
but you lose
because Wilde is on mine

 

BIGMOUTH STRIKES AGAIN

Sweetness, sweetness I was only joking
when I said Id like to smash every tooth
in your head
Sweetness, sweetness I was only joking
when I said by right s you should be
bludgeoned in your bed
and now I know how Joan of Arc felt
now I know how Joan of Arc felt
as the flames roseto her roman nose
and her Walkman stared to melt
Bibmouth, bigmouth
bigmouth strikes again
and Ive got no right to take my place
with the Human race
and now I know how Joan of Arc felt
now I know of Joan of Arc felt
as the flames rose to her roman nose
and her hearing aid started to melt
Bigmouth, bigmouth
bigmouth strikes again
and Ive got no right to take my place
with the Human race

 

THE BOY WITH A THORN IN HIS SIDE

The boy with the thorn in his side
behind the hatred there lies
a murderous desire for love
how can they look into my eyes
and still they dont believe me
how can they hear me say those words
and still they dont believe me
and if they don't believe me now
will they ever believe me?
and if they don't believe me now
will they ever believe me?
The boy with the thorn in his side
behind the hatred there lies
a plundering desire for love
how can they see the Love in our eyes
and still they don't believe us
and after all this time
they don't want to believe us
and if they dont believe us now
will they ever believe us ?
andd when you want to Live
how do you start ?
where do you go ?
who do you know?

 

VICAR IN A TUTU

I was minding mind business
lifting some lead off
the roof of the Holy Name church
it was worthwhile living a laughable life
just to set my eyes on a blistering sight
of a vicar in a tu-tu
he's not strange
he just wants to live his life this way
a scanty bit of a thing
with a decorative ring
that wouldn't cover the head of a child
as Rose collects the money in the cannister
who comes sliding down the bannister
the vicar in a tu-tu
he's not strange
he just wants to live his life this way
the monkish monsignor
with a head full of plaster
said "my man, get your vile soul dry-cleaned"
as Rose counts the money in the cannister
as natural as rain
he dances again
vicar in a tu-tu
The next day in the pulpit
with Freedom and Ease
combating ignoranca,dust and disease
as Rose counts the money in the cannister
as natural as rain
he dances again
the fabric of a tu-tu
any man could get us to
and I am a living sign.

 

THERE IS A LIGHT THAT NEVER GOES OUT

Take me out tonight
where there's music and there's people
who are young and alive
driving in your car
I never never want to go home
because I havent got one
anymore
take me out tonight
because I want to see people and I
want to see lights
driving in your car
oh please dont drop me home
because it's not my home, it's their
home, and Im welcome no morw
and if a double-decker bus
crashes in to us
to die by your side
such a heavenly way to die
and if a ten ton truck
kills the both of us
to die by your side
the pleasure and the privilege is mine
take me out tonight
oh take me anywhere, I dont care
and in the darken underpass
I thought Oh God, my chance has come at last
(but then a strange fear gripped me and I just couldn't ask)
take me out tonight
take me anywhere, I dont care
just driving in your car
I never never want to go home
because I havent got one
I havent got one.

 

SOME GIRLS ARE BIGGER THAN OTHERS

From the ice-age to the dole-age
there is but one concern
and I have just discover
some girls are bigger than others
some girls are bigger than others
some girls mothers are bigger than
other girls mothers
As Anthony said to Cleopatra
as he opened a crate of ale:
some girls are bigger than others
some girls are bigger than others
some girls mothers are bigger than
other girls mothers.

 

A RUSH AND A PUSH AND AND THE LAND IS OURS

HELLO
I am the ghost of Troubled Joe
hung by his pretty white neck
some eighteen months ago
I travelled to a mystical time zone
but I missed my bed
so I soon came home
they said:
"there's too much caffeine
in your bloodstream
and a lack of real spice
in your life"
I said:
"leave me alone
because I'm alright, dad
just surprised to still
be on my own...."
Ooh, but don't mention love
I'd hate the real strain of the pain again
a rush and a push and the land that
we stand on is ours
it has been before
so it shall be again
and people who are uglier than you and I
they take what they need, and leave
Ooh, but don't mention love
I'd hate the pain and the strain all over again
a rush and a push and the land that
we stand on is ours
it has been before
so why can't it be now?
and people who are weaker than you and I
they take what they want from life
Ooh, but don't mention love
no - just don't mention love!
a rush and a push and the land that
we stand on is ours
your youth may be gone
but you're still a young man
so phone me, phone me, phone me
so phone me, phone me, phone me
Ooh, I think I'm in love...
Urrgh, I think I'm in lerv

 

I STARTED SOMETHING I COULDN'T FINISH

The lanes were silent
with nothing or no one around for miles
I doused our friendly venture
with a hard-faced
three-word gesture
I started something
I forced you into a zone
and you were clearly
never meant to go
hair brushed and parted
typical me, typical me, typical me
I started something
...and now I'm not too sure
I grabbed you by the guilded beams
that's what Tradition means
and I doused another venture
with a gesture
that was...absolutely vile
I started something
forced you to a zone
and you were clearly
never meant to go
hair brushed and parted
typical me, typical me, typical me
I started something
...and now I'm not too sure
I grabbed you by the guilded beams
that's what Tradition means
and now eighteen months' hard-labour
seems...fair enough
I started something
forced you to a zone
and you were clearly
never meant to go
hair brushed and parted
typical me, typical me, typical me
I started something
and now I'm not too sure

 

DEATH OF A DISCO DANCER

The death of a disco dancer
well, it happens a lot 'round here
and if you think Peace
is a common goal
well, that goes to show
just how little you know
The death of a disco dancer
well, I'd rather not get involved
I never talk to my neighbour
I'd just rather not get involved
Love, peace and harmony?
Love, peace and harmony?
Oh, very nice, very nice, very nice, very nice
...but maybe in the next world.

 

GIRLFRIEND IN A COMA

Girlfriend in a coma, I know
I know - it's serious
Girlfriend in a coma, I know
I know - it's really serious
there wree times when I could
have 'murdered' her
(but, you know, I would hate
anything to happen to her)
NO, I DON'T WANT TO SEE HER
Do you really think
she'll pull through?
Do you really think
she'll pull through?
Girlfriend in a coma, I know
I know, it's serious
there were time when I could
have 'strangeled' her
(but, you know, I would hate
anything to happen to her)
WOULD YOU PLEASE LET ME SEE HER!
Do you really think she'll pull through?
Do you really think she'll pull through?
Let me wisper my last goodbyes
I know - IT'S SERIOUS

 

STOP ME IF YOU'VE HEARD THIS ONE BEFORE

Stop me, stop me,
stop me if you think that you've heard this one before
stop me, stop me
stop me if you think that you've heard this one before
nothing's changed
I still love you, oh I still love you
...only slightly less than I used to
I was delayed, I was way-laid
an emergency stop
I smelt the last ten seconds of life
I crashed down on the crossbar
and the pain was enough to make
a shy, bald buddhist reflect
and plan a mass-murder
who said I'd lied to her?
who said I'd lied because I never
who said I'd lied because I never
I was detained, I was restrained
he broke my spleen
he broke my knees
(and then he really laid into me)
Friday night in Out-patients
who said I'd lied to her?
who said I'd lied - because I never
who said I'd lied - because I never
Oh, so I drank one
or was it four
and when I fell on the floor
...I drank more
stop me, stop me
stop me if you think that you've heard this one before
nothing's changed
I still love you, I still love you
but only slightly
less than I used to

 

LAST NIGHT I DREAMT THAT SOMEBODY LOVED ME

Last night I dreamt
that somebody loved me
no hope - but no harm
just another false alarm
Las night I felt
real arms around me
no hope - no harm
just another false alarm
so, tell me how long
before the last one?
and tell me how long
before the right one?
this story is old - I KNOW
but it goes on
this story is old - I KNOW
but it goes on

 

UNHAPPY BIRTHDAY

I've come to wish you an unhappy birthday
I've come to wish you an unhappy birthday
because you're evil
and you lie
and if you should die
I may feel slightly sad
(but I won't cry)
Loved and lost
and some may say
when usually its Nothing
surely you're happy
it should be this way?
I say "No, I'm gonna kill my dog"
and: "May the lines sag heavy
and deep tonight XXX"
I've come to wish you an unhappy birthday
I've come to wish you an unhappy birthday
because you're evil
and you lie
and if you should die
I may feel slightly sad
(But I won't cry)
Loved and lost
some people say
when usually its Nothing
surely you're happy
it should be this way?
I said "No"
and then I shot myself
so, drink, drink, drink
and be ill tonight
from the one you left behind
from the one you left behind...

 

PAINT A VULGAR PICTURE

At the record company meeting
On their hands - a dead star
and ooh, the plans that they weave
and ooh, the sikening greed
At the record company meeting
on their hands - a dead star
the sycophantic slags all say:
"I knew him first, and I knew him well"
Re-issue! Re-package! Re-package!
Re-evaluate the songs
double-pack with a photograph
Extra Track (and a tacky badge)
A-list, playlist
"Please them, please them!"
"Please them! Please them!"
(sadly, THIS was your life)
but you could have said no
if you'd wanted to
you could have said no
if you'd wanted to
BPI, MTV, BBC
"Please them! Please them!"
(sadly this was your life)
but you could have said no
if you'd wanted to
you could have walked away
...couldn't you?
I touched you at the soundcheck
you had no real way of knowing
in my heart I bgged "please, take
me with you...
I don't care where you're going"
But to you I was faceless
I was fawning, I was boring
just a child from those ugly new houses
who could never begin to know
who could never really know
Best of? Most of?
Satiate the need
slip them into different sleeves!
Buy both, and be decieved
climber - new entry, re-entry
World tour! ("media whore")
"Please the Press in Belgium!"
(THIS was your life...)
and when it fails to recoup?
Well, maybe:
You just haven't earned it yet, baby
I walked a pace behind you at the soundcheck
you're just the same as I am
what makes most people feel happy
leads us headlong into harm
so, in my bedroom in those 'ugly new houses'
I dance my legs down to the knees
but me and my 'true love'
we will never meet again...
At the record company meeting
on their hands - at last! - a dead star!
but they cannot taint you in my eyes
no, they cannout touch you now
No, they cannot hurt you my darling
they cannot touch you now
but me and my 'true love'
will never meet again

 

DEATH AT ONE'S ELBOW

Ooh Glenn, don't come to the house tonight
Ooh, Glenn, don't come to the house tonight
because there's somebody here
who really really loves you
stay home
be bored
(it's crap, I KNOW)
Ooh, Glenn, don't come to the house tonight
Ooh, Glen, don't come to the house tonight
because there's somebody here
who'll take a hatchet to your ear
how the frustration renders me
hateful, Glenn!
don't come to the house tonight
don't come to the house tonight
because you'll slip on the
trail of my bespattered remains
and so, that's why
GOODBYE MY LOVE, GOODBYE MY LOVE, GOODBYE MY LOVE...
Belch

 

I WON'T SHARE YOU

I won't share you
I won't share you
with the drive and ambition
and the zeal I feel
this is my time
as the note I wrote
was read, she said
has the Perrier gone
straight to my head
or is life plainly sick and cruel, instead?
"YES!"
No-no-no-no-no-no
I won't share you
I won't share you
with the drive and the dreams inside
this is my time
Life tends to come and go
well, that's OK
just as long as you know
Life tends to come and go
well, that's OK
just as long as you know
I won't share you
I won't share you
with the drive and the dreams inside
this is my time, this is my time


THE QUEEN IS DEAD

Farewell to this lands cheerless marches
hemmed in like a boar between arches
her very Lowness with her head in a sling
Im truely sorry-but it sounds like a wonderful thing
dear Charles, dont you ever crave
to appear on the front of the Daily mail
dressed in your Mother's bridal veil?
So, I checked all the registered historical facts
and I was shocked into shame to discover
how Im the 18th pale descendent
of some, old queen or other
has the world changed, or have I changed?
has the world changed, or have I changed?
as some 9-year old tough peddles drugs
(I never even knew what drugs were)
And so, I broke into the Palace
with a sponge and a rusty spanner
she said: "Eh, I know you, and you cannot sing"
I said: "that's nothing -you should hear me play piano"
We can go for a walk where it's quiet and dry
and we can talk about precious things
but when you are tied to your mother's apron
not one talks about castration
We can go for a walk where it's quiet and dry
and we can talk about precious things
like love and law and poverty
these are the things that kill me
We can go for a walk where it's quiet and dry
and we can talk about precious things
but the rain that flattens my hair
theses are the things that kill me
Passed the Pub that saps your body
and the church who'll snatch your money
the Queen is dead, boys
and it's so lonely on a limb
Pass the Pub that wrecks your body
and the church-all they want is your money
the Queen is dead, boys`
you can trust me, boys
life is very long, when you're lonely
life is very long, when you're lonely...

 

PANIC

Panic on the streets of London
Panic on the streets of Birmingham
I wonder to myself
Could life ever be sane again
on the Leeds side-streets that you slip down
I wonder to myself
Hopes may rise on the Grasmeres
But Honey Pie, you're not safe here
So you run down
To the safety of the town
But there's Panic on the streets of Carlisle
Dublin, Dundee, Humberside
I wonder to myself
Burn down the Disco
Hang the blessed D.J.
Because the music that they constantly play
IT SAYS NOTHING TO ME ABOUT MY LIFE
Hang the blessed D.J.
Because the music they constantly play
On the Leeds side-streets that you slip down
On the provincial towns that you jog 'round
Hang the D.J.,. Hang the D.J.,.Hang the D.J...

 

VICAR IN A TUTU

I was minding mind business
lifting some lead off
the roof of the Holy Name church
it was worthwhile living a laughable life
just to set my eyes on a blistering sight
of a vicar in a tu-tu
he's not strange
he just wants to live his life this way
a scanty bit of a thing
with a decorative ring
that wouldn't cover the head of a child
as Rose collects the money in the cannister
who comes sliding down the bannister
the vicar in a tu-tu
he's not strange
he just wants to live his life this way
the monkish monsignor
with a head full of plaster
said "my man, get your vile soul dry-cleaned"
as Rose counts the money in the cannister
as natural as rain
he dances again
vicar in a tu-tu
The next day in the pulpit
with Freedom and Ease
combating ignoranca,dust and disease
as Rose counts the money in the cannister
as natural as rain
he dances again
the fabric of a tu-tu
any man could get us to
and I am a living sign.

 

ASK

Shyness is nice, but
Shyness can stop you
From doing all the things in life
That you'd like to
So, if there's something you'd like to try
ASK ME-I WON'T SAY "NO"-HOW COULD I?
Coyness is nice, but ,
Coyness can stop you
from saying all the things in
life that you want to
If there's something that you'd like to try
ASK ME-I WON'TSAY"NO"-HOW COULD I?
Spending warm, Summer days indoors
Writing fringhtening verse
To a buck-toothed girl in Luxembourg
ASK ME, ASK ME ,ASK ME, ASK ME, ASK ME ,ASK ME
Because if it's not Love
Then it's the Bomb
That will bring us together
Nature is a language-can't you read?
Nature is a language-can't you read?
ASK ME, ASK ME ,ASK ME, ASK ME, ASK ME ,ASK ME
Because if it's not Love
Then it's the Bomb
That will bring us together

 

MARIE'S THE NAME (HIS LATEST FLAME) / RUSHOLME RUFFIANS

Very old friend 
Came by today 
As he was telling everyone in town 
Of all the love that he'd just found 
And Marie's the name (of his latest flame) 
Talked and talked 
And I heard him say 
That she had the longest blackest hair 
Prettiest green eyes anywhere 
And Marie's the name (of his latest flame) 
The last night of the fair 
By the big wheel generator 
A boy is stabbed 
His money is grabbed 
And the air hangs heavy like a dulling wine 
She is Famous 
She is Funny 
An engagement ring 
Doesn't mean a thing 
To a mind consumed by brass (money), oh 
The last night of the fair 
From a seat on a whirling waltzer 
Her skirt ascends for a watching eye 
It's a hideous trait (on her mother's side)
From a seat on a whirling waltzer 
Her skirt ascends for a watching eye 
A hideous trait (on her mother's side) 
Then someone falls in love 
Someone's beaten up 
Someone's beaten up 
And the senses being dulled are mine 
And someone falls in love 
Someone's beaten up 
And the senses being dulled are mine 
This is the last night of the fair 
And the grease in the hair 
Of a speedway operator 
Is all a tremulous heart requires 
A schoolgirl is denied 
She said : "How quickly would I die 
If I jumped from the top of the parachutes ?"
This is the last night of the fair 
And the grease in the hair 
Of a speedway operator 
Is all a tremulous heart requires 
A schoolgirl is denied 
She said : "How quickly would I die 
Oh, if I jumped from the top of the parachutes ?"
...Oh, walk home alone 
I might walk home alone 
But my faith in love is still devout

 

THE BOY WITH THE THORN IN HIS SIDE

The boy with the thorn in his side
behind the hatred there lies
a murderous desire for love
how can they look into my eyes
and still they dont believe me
how can they hear me say those words
and still they dont believe me
and if they don't believe me now
will they ever believe me?
and if they don't believe me now
will they ever believe me?
The boy with the thorn in his side
behind the hatred there lies
a plundering desire for love
how can they see the Love in our eyes
and still they don't believe us
and after all this time
they don't want to believe us
and if they dont believe us now
will they ever believe us ?
andd when you want to Live
how do you start ?
where do you go ?
who do you know?

 

RUBBER RING / WHAT SHE SAID

Yeah! What she says : 
"How come someone hasn't noticed 
That I'm dead 
And decided to bury me ? 
God knows, I'm ready !"
La-la-la ... 
What she said was sad 
But then, all the rejection she's had 
To pretend to be happy 
Could only be idiocy 
La-la-la ... 
What she said was not for the job or 
Lover that she never had 
No no no ... 
What she read 
All heady books 
She'd sit and prophesise 
(It took a tattooed boy from 
Birkenhead 
To really really open her eyes)
What she read 
All heady books 
She'd sit and prophesise 
(It took a tattooed boy from 
Birkenhead 
To really really open her eyes)
What she said : 
"I smoke because I'm hoping for an 
Early death 
AND I NEED TO CLING TO SOMETHING !"
What she said : 
"I smoke because I'm hoping for an 
Early death 
AND I NEED TO CLING TO SOMETHING !"
No no no no ...

 

IS IT REALLY SO STRANGE?

I left the North 
I travelled South 
I found a tiny house 
And I can't help the way I feel 
Oh yes, you can kick me 
And you can punch me 
And you can break my face 
But you won't change the way I feel 
'Cause I love you, Oh ... 
And is it really so strange ? 
Oh, is it really so strange ? 
Oh, is it really so, really so strange ? 
I say NO, you say YES 
(and you will change your mind) 
I left the South 
I travelled North 
I got confused - I killed a horse 
I can't help the way I feel 
Oh yes, you can punch me 
And you can butt me 
And you can break my spine 
But you won't change the way I feel 
'Cause I love you, Oh ... 
And is it really so strange ? 
Oh, is it really so strange ? 
Oh, is it really so, really so strange ? 
I say NO, you say YES 
(But you will change your mind) 
I left the North again 
I travelled South again 
And I got confused - I killed a nun 
I CAN'T HELP THE WAY I FEEL 
(I lost my bag in Newport Pagnell) 
Why is the last mile the hardest mile ? 
My throat was dry, with the sun in my eyes 
And I realised, I realised 
I could never 
I could never, never, never, go back home again

 

CEMETERY GATES

A dreaded sunny day
so I meet you at the cemetry gates
Keats and Yeats are on your side
A dreaded sunny day
so I meet you at the cemetry gates
Keats and Yeats are on your side
while Wilde is on mine
So we go inside and we gravely read the stones
all those people all those lives
where are they now ?
with loves, and hates
and passions just like mine
they were born
and then they lived and then they died
which seems so unfair
and I wantr to crv
You say: "ere thrice the sun hath done salutation to the dawn"
and you claim these words as your own
but Im well-read, have heard them said
a hundred times (maybe less, maybe more)
if you must write prose/poems
the words you use should be your own
dont plagiarise or take "on loans"
there's alweays someone, somewhere
with a big nose, who knows
and who trips you up and laughs
when you fall
You say: "ere long done do does did "
words which could only be your own
you then produce the text
from whence was ripped
(some dizzy whore, 1804)
A dreaded sunny day
so let's go where we're happy
so I meet you at the cemetry gates
Keats and Yeats are on your side
A dreaded sunny day
so let's go where we're wanted
so I meet you at the cemetry gates
Keats and Yeats are on your side
but you lose
because Wilde is on mine

 

LONDON

Smoke
Lingers 'round your fingers
Train
Heave on - to Euston
Do you think you've made
The right decision this time?
You left
Your tired family grieving
And you think they're sad because you're leaving
But didn't you see the Jealousy in the eyes
Of the ones who had to stay behind?
And do you think you've made
The right decision thins time?
You left
Your girlfriend on the platform
With thei really ragged notion that you'll return
But she knows
That when he goes
He really goes
So do you think you've made
The right decision this time?

 

I KNOW IT'S OVER

I can feel the soil falling over my head 
And as I climb into an empty bed 
Oh well. Enough said. 
I know it's over - still I cling 
I don't know where else I can go 
Over ... 
Oh Mother, I can feel the soil falling over my head 
See, the sea wants to take me 
The knife wants to cut me 
Do you think you can help me ? 
Sad veiled bride, please be happy 
Handsome groom, give her room 
Loud, loutish lover, treat her kindly 
(Though she needs you 
More than she loves you) 
And I know it's over - still I cling 
I don't know where else I can go 
Over, it's over, it's over, it's over 
It's over, la ... 
I know it's over 
And it never really began 
But in my heart it was so real
And you even spoke to me, and said : 
"If you're so funny 
Then why are you on your own tonight ? 
And if you're so clever 
Then why are you on your own tonight ? 
I know ... 
'Cause tonight - it's just like any other night 
That's why you're on your own tonight 
Your triumphs and your charms 
While they're in each other's arms..."
It's so easy to laugh 
It's so easy to hate 
It takes strength to be gentle and kind 
Over, over, over, over 
It's so easy to laugh 
It's so easy to hate 
It takes guts to be gentle and kind 
Over, over 
Love is Natural and Real 
But not for you, my love 
Not tonight, my love 
Love is Natural and Real 
But not for such as you and I, my love 
Oh Mother, I can feel the soil falling over my head...
Oh Mother, I can feel the soil fall over, fall over my head 
Oh Mother, I can feel the ... fall over my ... , Oh ...

 

THE DRAIZE TRAIN

A vastly superior version of the instrumental B-side, acting as a peace 
offering to Marr (Morrissey chose the tracks for the compilation, 
and of course, receives no royalties on this track).

 

STILL ILL

I decree today that life
is simply taking and not giving
England is mine and it owes me a living
ask me why, and I'll spit in your eye
ask me why, and I'll spit in your eye
but we cannot cling to the old dreams anymore
no, we cannot cling to the old dreams anymore
Does the body rule the mind
or does the mind rule the body?
I dunno...
Under the iron bridge we kissed
and although I ended up with sore lips
it just wasn't like the old days anymore
no, it wasn't like those days
am I still ill?
Does the body rule the mind
or does the mind rule the body ?
I dunno...
Ask me why, and I'll die
ask me why, and I'll die
and if you must go to work tomorrow
well, if I were you I wouldn't bother
for there are brighter sides to life
and I should know because I've seen them
but not very often...
under the iron bridge we kissed
and although I ended up with sore lips
it just wasn't like the old days anymore
no, it wasn't like those days
am I still ill?

 

BIGMOUTH STRIKES AGAIN

Sweetness, sweetness I was only joking
when I said Id like to smash every tooth
in your head
Sweetness, sweetness I was only joking
when I said by right s you should be
bludgeoned in your bed
and now I know how Joan of Arc felt
now I know how Joan of Arc felt
as the flames roseto her roman nose
and her Walkman stared to melt
Bibmouth, bigmouth
bigmouth strikes again
and Ive got no right to take my place
with the Human race
and now I know how Joan of Arc felt
now I know of Joan of Arc felt
as the flames rose to her roman nose
and her hearing aid started to melt
Bigmouth, bigmouth
bigmouth strikes again
and Ive got no right to take my place
with the Human race

 
ALSATIAN COUSTIN

Were you and he Lovers?
and would you say so if you were?
on a forecourt
on a Friday
passing my way
Were you and he Lovers?
and if you were, then say that you were!
on a groundsheet
under canvas
with your tent-flap
open wide
A note upon his desk:
"P.S. Bring Me Home And Have Me!"
Leather elbows on a tweed coat
- Oh! -
Is THAT the best you can do?
So came his reply:
"...but on the desk is where I want you!"
So I ask (even though I know):
were you and he Lovers?

 

LITTLE MAN, WHAT NOW?

An afternoon nostalgia
television show
you spoke in silhouette
(but they couldn't name you)
although the panel were
very polite to you
but I remembered you
from Friday nights 1969
ATV - you murdered every line
too old to be a child star
too young to take leads
four seasons passed
and they AXED you
nervously juvenile
(WON'T SMILE!)
What became of you?
did that swift eclipse torture you?
a star at eighteen
and then-suddenly gone
down to a few lines
in the back page of a teenage annual
oh but I remembered you
I looked up to you

 

EVERYDAY IS LIKE SUNDAY

Trudging slowly over wet sand
back to the bench
where your clothes were stolen
this is the coastal town
that they forgot to close down
Armageddon - come Armageddon!
Come Armageddon! Come!
Everyday is like Sunday
everyday is silent and grey
Hide on the promenade
scratch out a postcard
"how I dearly with I was not here"
in the seaside town
...that they forgot to bomb
Come! Come! Come - nuclear bomb!
Everyday is like Sunday
everyday is silent and grey
Trudging back over pebbles and sand
and a strange dust lands on your hands
(and on your face)
Everyday is like Sunday
"Win Yourself A Cheap Tray"
share some greased tea with me
everyday is silent and grey

 

BENGALI IN PLATFORMS

No no no
he does not want to depress you
oh no no no no no
he only wants to impress you
Bengali in platform
she only wants to embrace your culture
and to be your friend forever
Bengali, Bengali
oh shelve your Western plans
and understand that life is hard enough when you belong here
A silver-studded rim that glistens
and an ankle-star that...blinds me
a lemon sole so very high
which only reminds me, to tell you
so I break the news gently
I break the news to you gently
"Shelve your plans"
Bengali, Bengali
its the touchy march of time
that blinds you
don't blame me
don't hate me
just because I'm the one to tell you
that life is hard enough when you belong here
life is hard enough when you belong here
shelve your western plans
life is hard enough when you belong here

 

ANGEL, ANGEL, DOWN WE GO TOGETHER

Angel, Angel
don't take your life tonight
I know they take
and that they take in turn
and they give you nothing real
for yourself in return
and when they've used you
and they've broken you
and wasted all your money
and cast your shell aside
and when they've bought you
and they've sold you
and they've billed you for the pleasure
and they've made your parents cry
I will be here
BELIEVE ME
I will be here
...believe me
Angel, don't take your life
some people have got no pride
they do not understand
the Urgency of life
but I love you more than life
I love you more than life
I love you more than life
I love you more than life

 

LALE NIGHT, MAUDLIN STREET

The last night on Maudlin Street
goodbye house
goodbye stairs
I was born here
I was raised here, and
...I took some stick here
love at first sight
may sound trite
but it's true, you know
I could list the details
of everything you ever wore
or said, or how you stood that day
and as we spend the last night
on Maudlin Street, I say
"goodbye house-forever!"
I never stole a happy hour
around here
Where the world's ugliest boy
became what you see
here I am - the ugliest man
Its the last night on Maudlin Street
and truly I do love you
oh, truly I do love you
When I sleep with that picture of
you framed beside my bed
oh, it's childish and it's silly
but I think it's you in my room
by the bed (...yes, I told you it was silly...)
and I know
I took strange pills
but I never meant to hurt you
oh truly I love you
I came home late one night
everyone had gone to bed
nobody stays up for you
when you have sixteen stitches
all around your head
the last buss I missed to Maudlin Street
so, he drove me home in the Van
complaining: "Women only like me for my mind..."
don't leave your torch behind
power-cuts ahead
as we crept through the park
but no I cannot steal a pair of jeans
off a clothesline for you
but you...without clothes
oh I could not keep a straight face
me - without clothes?
well a nation turns its back and gags...
I'm packed
I am moving house
a half-life disappears today
every slag waves me on
(secretly wishing me gone
well, I will be soon
oh - I will be soon)
There were bad times on Maudlin Street
when they took you away in a police car
dear Inspector - don't you know?
don't you care?
don't you know - about Love?
Your gran died
and your mother died
on Maudlin Street
in pain and ashamed
with never time to say
those special things
I took the keys from Maudlin Street
well, it's only bricks and mortar!
and...truly I do love you
wherever you are
wherever you are

 

SUEDHEAD

Why do you come here
why do you hang around
I'm so sorry
I'm so sorry
Why do you come here
when you know it makes
things hard for me
when you know, oh
why do you come?
Why do you telephone?
and why send me silly notes?
I'm so sorry
I'm so sorry
why do you come here
when you know it makes
thing hard for me
when you know, oh
why do you come?
You had to sneak into my room
'just' to read my diary
was it just to see all the things
you knew I'd written about you?
and...so many illustrations
I'm so very sickened
oh, I am so sickened NOW

 

BREAK UP THE FAMILY

The strange logic of your clumsiest line
stayed emblazoned on my mind
break up the family
and lets begin to live our lives
I went to see all my friends tonight
it wasn't Youth, it wasn't even Life
born Old, sadly wise
resigned (well, we were)
to ending our lives
I'm so glad to grow older
to move away from those awful times
I want to see all my friends tonight
Yes you found love but you weren't
at peace with your life
home late, full of Hate
despise the ties that bind
oh I'm so glad to grow older
to move away from those younger years
now I'm in love for the first time
and I don't feel bad
Let me see all my old friends
let me put my arm around them
because I really do love them
now, does that sound mad?
Captain of games, solid framed
I stood on the touchline
hailstones, driven home
in his car - no breaks? I don't mind
I'm just so glad to grow older
to move away from those darker years
I'm in love for the first time
and I don't feel bad
so wish me luck my friends
goodbye

 

HAIRDRESSER ON FIRE

Here is London
here is London
is it home of the free,
or what?
can you squeeze me
into an empty page of your diary
and psychologically save me
I've got faith in you
I sense the power
in the fingers
within an hour the power
can totally destroy me
or it could same my life
here is London
'home of the brash, outrageous
and free'
you are repressed
but you're remarkably dressed
is it Real?
but you're far to busy
busy scissors
busy clippers
hair dresser on fire
all around Sloane Square
and you're far too busy
to see me
"busy,busy"
hairdresser on fire
was a client over-cautious
he made you nervous
and when he said
"I'm gonna sue you"
I really felt for you
so can you squeeze me
into an empty page of your diary
and supernaturally change me
CHANGE ME, CHANGE ME

 

THE ORDINARY BOYS

Ordinary boys, happy knowing nothing
happy being no one, but themselves
Ordinary girls, supermarket clothes
who think it's very clever to be cruel to you
for you were so different
you stood all alone
and you knew
that it had to be so
avoiding ordinary boys
happy going nowhere, just around here
in their rattling cars
and ordinary girls
never seeing further
than the cold, small streets
that trap them
but you were so different
you had to say no
when those empty fools
tried to change you, and claim you
for the lair of their ordinary world
where they feel so lucky
so lucky, so lucky
with their lives laid out before them
they're so lucky, so lucky
so lucky, so lucky

 

I DON'T MIND IF YOU FORGET ME

I don't mind
I don't mind if you forget me
having learned my lesson
I never left an impression on anyone
so now you send me your hardened 'regards'
when once you'd send me 'love'
sincerely I must tell you
your mild 'best wishes'
they make me suspicious
but I don't mind
I don't mind if you forget me
having learned my lesson
I never left
an impression on anyone
the pressure to change, to move on
was strange
and very strong
so this is why I tell you
I really do understand
BYE BYE
I don't mind if you forget me
no no no no no no no
REJECTION IS ONE THING
BUT REJECTION FROM A FOOL
IS CRUEL
REJECTION IS ONE THING
BUT REJECTION FROM A FOOL
IS CRUEL
and I don't mind if you forget me
I don't mind if your forget me

 

DIAL-A-CLICHE

Further into the fog I fall
well, I was just
following you!
when you said:
"Do as I do and scrap your fey ways"
(dial-a-cliche)
"grow up, be a man, and close your mealy-mouth!"
(dial-a-cliche)
But the person underneath
where does he go?
does he slide by the wayside?
or...does he just die?
when you find that you've organized
your feelings, for people
who didn't like you then
and certainly don't like you now
yet still you say:
"Do as I do and scrap your fey ways"
(dial-a-cliche)
"grow up, be a man, and close your mealy-mouth!"
(dial-a-cliche)
"the Safe way is the only way!
there's always time to change, son!"
yes well I've changed
but I'm in pain!
dial-a-chiche

 

MARGARET ON THE GUILLOTINE

The kind people
have a wonderful dream
Margaret on the guillotine
because people like you
make me feel so tired
when will you die?
when will you die?
when will you die?
when will you die?
when will you die?
because people like you
make me feel so old inside
please die
and kind people
do not shelter this dream
make it real
make the dream real
make the dream real
make it real

 

OUR FRANK

Our frank and open
deep conversations
they get me nowhere
they bring me down, so
give it a rest, won't you?
give me a cigarette
God give me patience
just no more conversation
Give us a drink
and make it quick
or else I'm gonna be sick
sick all over
your frankly vulgar
red pullover
now see how the colours blend
Our frank and open
deep conversations
they get me nowhere
they bring me down, so
give it a rest, won't you?
now will you just give over
the world may be ending
but look, I'm only human
Give us a drink
and make it quick
or else I'm gonna be sick
all over
your frankly vulgar
red pullover
now see how the two colours blend
Won't somebody stop me
from thinking all the time
about everything
so deeply
so bleakly

 

ASIAN RUT

Day oh so late
strangely the sun still shone
oh Asian boy
what are you on?
Day oh so late
strangely the sun still shone
what drugs are you on?
Tooled-up Asian boy
has come here to avenge
the cruel, cold killing
of his very best friend
Tooled-up Asian boy
has come here to take revenge
for the cruel, cold killing
of his only friend
Peace through the school
so quiet in the hall
it's a strange sign for one
of what's to come
Tough and hard and pale
oh they may just impale you on railings
oh English boys
it must be wrong
three against one?
Brakes slammed, and
a gun jammed, and
as far as I could tell
brave Asian boy
dealt a blow and fell
I'm just passing through here
on my way to somewhere civilised
and maybe I'll even arrive
maybe I'll even arrive?

 

SING YOUR LIFE

Sing your life
any fool can think of words that rhyme
many others do
why don't you?
do you want to?
Sing your life
just walk right up to the microphone
and name
all the things that you love
all the things that you loathe
sing your life
all the things that you love
all the things that you loathe
oh sing your life
oh sing your life
Others sang your life
but now's your chance to shine
and have the pleasure of
saying what you mean
the rare pleasure of
meaning what you sing
oh, make no mistake, my friend
all of this will end
so sing it now
all the things you love
all the things you loathe
oh sing your life
all the things that you love
all the things that you loathe
oh sing your, oh sing your
Don't leave it all unsaid
somewhere in the wasteland of your head
and make no mistake, my friend
your pointless life will end
but before you go
can you look at the truth?
You have a lovely singing voice
a lovely singing voice
and all of those
who sing on key
they stole the notion
from you and me

 

MUTE WITNESS

Your poor witness
crying so loudly on the floor
oh but she's only trying to tell you
what it was that she saw
she is only trying to tell you
what it was that she saw
Now see her standing on the table
with her small arms flailing
and you feel such compassion
in your soul for
Your poor mute witness
still testing the strength
of our patience
oh but she's only trying to tell you
what it was that she saw
Now see her pointing to the frisbee
with a memory too fuzzy
as her silent words
describe the fright of last night
4 a.m. Norhtside, Clapham Common
who knows what she was doing there?
will she sketch the answer later?
Well, I'll ask her
"now dry your tears, my dear"
Now see her mime in time so nicely
it would all have been so clear
is only she had never volunteered
"your taxi is here, my dear"

 

KING LEER

Your boyfriend, he
went down on one knee
well, could it be
he's only got one knee?
I tried to surprise you
with Vodka
or, Tizer
I can't quite remember
but you didn't thank me
you didn't even thank me
because you never do
Your boyfriend, he
has the gift of the gab
or, could it be
the gift of the grab?
I tried to surprise you
I lay down beside you
and...nothing much happened
and you didn't phone me
you didn't even phone me
because it's not your style
to dial
Your boyfriend, he
displays to me
more than just
a hint of cruelty
I tried to surprise you
I crept up behind you
with a homeless chihuahua
you gushed for an hour
you handed him back and said
"You'll never guess
I'm bored now"

 

FOUND FOUND FOUND

found found found found found found
someone who's worth it
in this murkiness
someone who's never
seeming scheming
found found found found found found
someone who's worth it
in this murkiness
someone who's never
seeming scheming
Oh, but if I'd never found
oh, but if I'd never found
oh, but if I'd never found
I do believe that
the more you give your love
and I do believe that
the more you offer trust
the more you chase
the more you cry
the more you're bound to lose
the more you're bound to lose
Oh, but if I'd never found
oh, but if I'd never found
somebody
who wants to be
who wants to be
with me
all the time

 

DRIVING YOUR GIRLFRIEND HOME

I'm driving
your girlfriend home
and she's saying
how she never chose you
"turn left", she says
so I turn left
and she says
"So how did I end up
so deeply involved in
the very existence
I planned on avoiding?"
and I can't answer
I'm driving
your girlfriend home
and she's laughing
to stop herself crying
"drive on", she says
so I drive on
and she says
"So how did I end up
attached to this person
when his sense of humour
gets gradually worser?"
and I can't tell her
I'm parking
outside her home
and we're shaking hands
goodnight, so politely

 

THE HARSH TRUTH OF THE CAMERA EYE

Churchillian legs
hair barely there
the harsh truth of the camera eye
Your eyes signal pain
because of the strain
of smiling
the harsh truth of the camera eye
telling you all
that you never wnated to know
showing what
you didn't want shown
My so friendly lens
zooms into
"the inner you"
and it tells the harsh truth
and nothing but
Laugh with us all here
that's if you can
then take the pictures home
and screamtelling you all
that you never wanted to know
showing you what
you didn't want shown
This photographer
he must have really had it in for you
"Oh, I don't want
to be judged anymore
I don't wnat to be judged
I would sooner be Loved
I would sooner be
just blindly Loved..."

 

(I'M) THE END OF THE FAMILY LINE

With no complications
fifteen generations
(of mine)
all honouring Nature
until I arrive
(with incredible style)
I'm the end fo the line
the end of the family line
the end of the line
No baby pulled screaming
out into this seething whirl
by chance or whim
(or even love?)
our family tree hacked into decline
and I'm spared the pain
of ever saying
("goodbye")
I'm the end of the line
the end of the family line
the end of the line

 

THERE'S A PLACE IN HELL FOR ME AND MY FRIENDS

There is a place
reserved
for me and my friends
and when we go
we all will go
so you see
I'm never alone
there is a place
with a bit more time
and a few more
gentler words
and looking back
we do forgive
(we had no choice
we always did)
all that we hope
is that when we go
our skin
and our blood
and our bones
don't get in your way
making you ill
the way they did
when we lived
There is a place
a place in hell
reserved
for me and my friends
and if ever I
wanted to cry
then I will
because I can

 

TONY THE PONY

Still drinking on the corner 
Just don't say I didn't warn you 
Always nagging big brother 
He's only looking out for you 
Tony The Pony 
Tony The Pony 
You're still standing on the corner 
Just don't say I didn't warn you 
Old and jealous big brother 
You had your time and you spent it 
Crying 
Now, Tony The Pony 
Tony The Pony 
So, that's what they call you now ? 
When you're free outside 
So cold and hard and in control 
And ... 
There's a free ride on 
Tony The Pony 
Oh, why do you always wanna stop me 
From doing the things in life that make me happy ? 
And when I'm outside with friends, laughing loudly 
Why do you always wanna stop me ? 
Oh, I would never 
I would never 
But you will carry the can for anyone 
The free ride on 
Gullible Tony 
You're drunker quicker 
And you're sicker even quicker 
For something heavy is gonna fall on you 
Oh ... 
And what do they call you now ? 
When you're free outside 
So cold and hard and in control 
And, oh ... been a lark 
There's a free ride on 
Fucked-up Tony 
I will never say I told you so 
Or how I knew that something bad 
Would happen to you 
I don't wanna say I told you so 
Oh, but Tony, I told you so !!! 
I told you so

 

YOU'RE GONNA NEED SOMEONE ON YOUR SIDE

With the world's fate 
Resting on your shoulder 
You're gonna need 
Someone on your side 
You can't do it by yourself 
Any longer 
You're gonna need 
Someone on your side 
Someone kindly told me 
That you'd wasted 
Eight of nine lives
Oh, give yourself a break 
Before you break down 
You're gonna need someone on your side 
And here I am, And here I am 
Well, you don't need 
To look so pleased ! 
Day or night, 
There is no difference 
You're gonna need someone on your side 
Day or night, 
There is no difference 
You're gonna need someone soon 
And here I am, And here I am 
Well, you don't need 
To look so pleased

 

GLAMOROUS GLUE

First day with the jar 
You find 
Everyone lies 
First day with the jar 
You find 
Everyone lies, nobody minds 
Everyone lies 
Where is the man you respect ? 
And where is the woman you love ? 
Where's the woman you love ? 
Third week with the jar
You find 
Everything dies 
We won't vote Conservative 
Because we never have 
Everyone lies, everyone lies 
Where is the man you respect ? 
And where is the woman you love ? 
Where's the woman you love ? 
Everything of worth 
On Earth Is there To share 
I used to dream, and I used to vow 
I wouldn't dream of it now 
We look to Los Angeles 
For the language we use 
London is dead, London is dead, London is dead...
Now I'm too much in love 
I'm too much in love 
I know 
I'll go 
Empty hand 
From the land

 

WE'LL LET YOU KNOW

How sad are we ? 
And how sad have we been ? 
We'll let you know 
We'll let you know 
Oh, but only if - you're really interested 
You wonder how 
We've stayed alive 'till now 
We'll let you know 
We'll let you know 
But only if - you're really interested 
We're all smiles 
Then, honest, I swear, it's the turnstiles 
That make us hostile 
Oh ... 
We will descend 
On anyone unable to defend 
Themselves 
Oh ... 
And the songs we sing 
They're not supposed to mean a thing 
La, la, la, la ... 
Oh ...You're lonely, Oh ... you're lonely, Oh ... 
GET OFF THE ROOF ! Oh ... 
Your Arsenal !
We may seem cold, or 
We may even be 
The most depressing people you've ever known 
At heart, what's left, we sadly know 
That we are the last truly British people you'll ever know 
We are the last truly British people you will ever know 
You'll never never want to know

 

THE NATIONAL FRONT DISCO

David, the wind blows 
The wind blows ... 
Bits of your life away 
Your friends all say ... 
"Where is our boy ? Oh, we've lost our boy" 
But they should know 
Where you've gone 
Because again and again you've explained that 
You're going to ... 
Oh, you're going to ... 
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah 
England for the English ! 
England for the English ! 
David, the winds blow 
The winds blow ...
All of my dreams away 
And I still say : 
"Where is our boy ? Ah, we've lost our boy" 
But I should know 
Why you've gone 
Because again and again you've explained
You've gone to the ... 
National, ah ... 
To the National .. 
There's a country; you don't live there 
But one day you would like to 
And if you show them what you're made of 
Oh, then you might do ... 
But David, we wonder 
We wonder if the thunder 
Is ever really gonna begin 
Begin, begin 
Your mom says : 
"I've lost my boy" 
But she should know 
Why you've gone 
Because again and again you've explained 
You've gone to the : 
National 
To the National 
To the National Front Disco 
Because you want the day to come sooner 
You want the day to come sooner 
You want the day to come sooner 
When you've settled the score 
Oh, the National 
Oh, the National

 

CERTAIN PEOPLE I KNOW

I take the cue from 
Certain people I know 
I use the cue 
And then I 
Hand it on to you 
And when I swing it 
So, it catches his eye ... 
(Weren't you there ? 
- You'd have died !) 
I trust the views of 
Certain people I know 
They look at Danger 
And they 
LAUGH THEIR HEADS OFF 
Their clothes are Imitation 
George the 23rd 
(Don't you find this absurd ?) 
I'd hate to be like 
Certain people I know 
They break their necks 
And can't afford to
Get them fixed 
Ah, they'd sacrifice all 
Of their principles for 
anything cashable 
I do believe it's terrible 
Oh, wo, wo, Ah, ah, ah, ah, Oh, wo, wo...

 

WE HATE IT WHEN OUR FRIENDS BECOME SUCCESSFUL

We hate it when our friends become successful 
We hate it when our friends become successful 
Oh, look at those clothes 
Now look at that face, it's so old 
And such a video ! 
Well, it's really laughable 
Ha, ha, ha ...
We hate it when our friends become successful 
And if they're Northern, that makes it even worse
And if we can destroy them 
You bet your life we will 
Destroy them 
If we can hurt them 
Well, we may as well ... 
It's really laughable 
Ha, ha, ha ... 
You see, it should've been me 
It could've been me 
Everybody knows 
Everybody says so 
They say : 
"Ah, you have loads of songs 
So many songs 
More songs than they'd stand 
Verse 
Chorus 
Middle eight 
Break, fade 
Just listen ..."
La, la-la, la-la

SEASICK, YET STILL DOCKED

I am a poor freezingly cold soul 
So far from where 
I intended to go 
Scavenging through life's very constant lulls 
So far from where I'm determined to go 
Wish I knew the way to reach the one I love
There is no way ... 
Wish I had the charm to attract the one I love 
But you see, I've got no charm 
Mmm...
Tonight I've consumed much more than I can hold 
Oh, this is very clear to you 
And you can tell I have never really loved 
You can tell, by the way, I sleep all day
And all of my life no-one gave me anything 
No-one has ever given me anything 
My love is as sharp as a needle in your eye 
You must be such a fool 
To pass me by

 

I KNOW IT'S GONNA HAPPEN SOMEDAY

My love, wherever you are 
Whatever you are 
Don't lose faith 
I know it's gonna happen someday 
To you 
Please wait ... Please wait ... Oh ... Wait ... 
Don't lose faith 
You say that the day just never arrives 
And it's never seemed so far away 
Still, I know it's gonna happen someday 
To you 
Please wait ... 
Don't lose faith

 

TOMORROW

Tomorrow 
Will it really come ?

All I ask of you is one thing that you never do 
Would you put your arms around me ?

Tomorrow 
Does it have to come ?
All I ask of you is one thing that you'll never do 
Would you put your arms around me ? 
(I won't tell anybody) 
Tomorrow 
And what must come before ...
Oh, the pain in my arms 
Oh, the pain in my legs 
Ooh, my shiftless body 
Tomorrow 
It's surely nearer now ? 
You don't think I'll make it 
I never said I wanted to ! 
Well did I ? 
Oh, the pain in my arms 
Oh, the pain in my legs 
Oh, yeah; oh, yeah, No, yeah; no, yeah 
Through my shiftless body 
Tomorrow, Tomorrow 
All I ask of you ... oh ... 
Is : would you tell me that you love me 
Tell me, tell me that you love me, Tell me, tell me that you love me ... 
Ah, I know you don't mean it 
Ah, I know you don't mean it 
Tell me, tell me that you love me, Tell me, tell me that you love me ...

Because you want the day to come sooner 
You want the day to come sooner 
You want the day to come sooner 
When you've settled the score 
Oh, the National, Oh, the National…

 

NOVEMBER SPAWNED A MONSTER

Sleep on and dream of Love
because it's the closest you will get to love
poor twisted child, so ugly, so ugly
poor twisted child, oh hug me, oh hug me
one November spawned a monster 
in the shape of this child who later cried
"But Jesus made me, so Jesus save me from
pity, sympathy and people discussing me"
a frame of useless limbs what can make GOOD
all the BAD that's been done?
And if the lights were out
could you even bear
to kiss her full on the mouth (or anywhere?)
poor twisted child, so ugly, so ugly
poor twisted child, oh hug me, oh hug me
one November spawned a monster 
in the shape of this child who must remain
a hostage to kindess and the wheels underneath her
a hostage to kindess and the wheels underneath her
a symbol of where mad, mad lovers
must PAUSE and draw the line
So sleep and dream of love
because it's the closest
you will get to love
that November is a time which I must put OUT of my mind
oh one fine day 
LET IT BE SOON
she won't be rich or beautiful
but she'll be walking your streets
in the clothes that she went out
and chose for herself

 

SEASICK, YET STILL DOCKED

I am a poor freezingly cold soul 
So far from where 
I intended to go 
Scavenging through life's very constant lulls 
So far from where I'm determined to go 
Wish I knew the way to reach the one I love
There is no way ... 
Wish I had the charm to attract the one I love 
But you see, I've got no charm 
Mmm...
Tonight I've consumed much more than I can hold 
Oh, this is very clear to you 
And you can tell I have never really loved 
You can tell, by the way, I sleep all day
And all of my life no-one gave me anything 
No-one has ever given me anything 
My love is as sharp as a needle in your eye 
You must be such a fool 
To pass me by

 

THE LOOP

I just wanna say 
I haven't been away 
I'm still right here 
Where I always was 
So one day, if you're bored 
By all means call 
Because you can do 
(But only if you want to) 
I just wanna say 
I haven't been away 
I am still right here 
Where I always was 
So one day, when you're bored 
By all means call 
Because you can do 
But you might not get through

 

SISTER I'M A POET

All over this town 
Yes, a low wind may blow 
And I can see through everybo... 
With no reason 
To hide these words I feel 
And no reason 
To talk about the books I read 
But still I do 
That's 'cause I'm a ... Sister I'm a ... 
All over this town 
Along this way 
Outside the prison gates 
I love the romance of crime 
And I wonder 
Does anybody feel the way I do ? 
And is evil just something you are 
Or something you do ? 
Sister I'm a ... Sister I'm a ... 
All over this town, All over this town 
They pull over 
In their Citroen vans 
Not to shake your hand 
With meths on their breaths 
And you with youth on your side 
A plastic bag stranded at the lights 
This once was me ...
But now I'm a ... Sister I'm a ...
All over this town ... Oh, oh, oh 
All over this town, All over this town, Oh ... 
I still cannot speak French ... I am very lazy

 

JACK THE RIPPER

Oh, you look so tired 
Mouth slack and wide 
Ill-housed and ill-advised 
Your face is as mean 
As your life has been 
Crash into my arms 
I WANT YOU 
You don't agree -
But you don't refuse 
I know you 
And I know a place 
Where no one is likely to pass 
Oh, you don't care if it's late 
And you don't care if you're lost 
And oh, you look so tired 
(But tonight you presumed too much) 
Too much, too much 
And if it's the last 
Thing I ever do 
I'M GONNA GET YOU 
Crash into my arms 
I WANT YOU 
You don't agree -
But you don't refuse 
I know you 
And no one knows a thing about my life 
I can come and go as I please 
And if I want to, I can stay 
Oh, or if I want to, I can leave 
Nobody knows me, Nobody knows me, Nobody knows me Oh, oh...

 

SUCH A LITTLE THING MAKES SUCH A BIG DIFFERENCE

Such a little thing, such a little thing
but the difference it made was grave
there you go
wielding a bicycle chain
oh why won't you change
cange and be nicer?
such a little thing
a gentle tone of kindness
or written words on paper
- can you write?
How I love all of
the very simple things of life
(God's good air)
how I love all of
the very simple things of life
such a little thing
a fumbling politeness
the difference it saved me
wielding a bicycle chain
"I WILL NOT CHANGE AND I WILL NOT BE NICE"
Most people keep their brains between your legs (don't you find?)
Leave me alone - I was only singing, leave me alone because
I was only singing
leave me alone - I was only singing, leave me alone
you have just proved (again)
MOST PEOPLE KEEP THEIR BRAINS BETWEEN THEIR LEGS

 

I KNOW IT'S GONNA HAPPEN SOMEDAY

My love, wherever you are 
Whatever you are 
Don't lose faith 
I know it's gonna happen someday 
To you 
Please wait ... 
Please wait ... 
Oh ... Wait ... 
Don't lose faith 
You say that the day just never arrives 
And it's never seemed so far away 
Still, I know it's gonna happen someday 
To you 
Please wait ... 
Don't lose faith

 

WE'LL LET YOU KNOW

How sad are we ? 
And how sad have we been ? 
We'll let you know, We'll let you know 
Oh, but only if - you're really interested 
You wonder how 
We've stayed alive 'till now 
We'll let you know, We'll let you know 
But only if - you're really interested 
We're all smiles 
Then, honest, I swear, it's the turnstiles 
That make us hostile 
Oh ... We will descend 
On anyone unable to defend 
Themselves 
Oh ... And the songs we sing 
They're not supposed to mean a thing 
La, la, la, la ... Oh ...
You're lonely, Oh ... you're lonely 
Oh ... 
GET OFF THE ROOF !
Oh ... Your Arsenal !
We may seem cold, or 
We may even be 
The most depressing people you've ever known 
At heart, what's left, we sadly know 
That we are the last truly British people you'll ever know 
We are the last truly British people you will ever know 
You'll never never want to know

 

SUEDHEAD

Why do you come here
why do you hang around
I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry
Why do you come here
when you know it makes
things hard for me
when you know, oh
why do you come?
Why do you telephone?
and why send me silly notes?
I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry
why do you come here
when you know it makes
thing hard for me
when you know, oh
why do you come?
You had to sneak into my room
'just' to read my diary
was it just to see all the things
you knew I'd written about you?
and...so many illustrations
I'm so very sickened
oh, I am so sickened NOW

 

HE KNOWS I'D LOVE TO SEE HIM

He Knows (he knows)
Or, I think he does
because when I lived
in the Arse of the world...
he knows, he knows, he knows I'd love
to see him happy (or as close as is allowed)
because when I lived
in the Arse of the world
he knows, he knows, he knows I'd love
to see him happy (or as close as possible
as close as possible, as close as is allowed)
My name still conjours up deadly deeds
and a bad taste in the mouth
the police - they actually knew me
they said:
"You're just another person in the world
you're just another fool with radical views
you're just another who has maddening views
you want to turn it on its head
by staying in bed!"
I said: "I know I do"

 

YOU'RE GONNA NEED SOMEONE ON YOUR SIDE

With the world's fate 
Resting on your shoulder 
You're gonna need 
Someone on your side 
You can't do it by yourself 
Any longer 
You're gonna need 
Someone on your side 
Someone kindly told me 
That you'd wasted 
Eight of nine lives
Oh, give yourself a break 
Before you break down 
You're gonna need someone on your side 
And here I am, And here I am 
Well, you don't need 
To look so pleased ! 
Day or night, 
There is no difference 
You're gonna need someone on your side 
Day or night, 
There is no difference 
You're gonna need someone soon 
And here I am, And here I am 
Well, you don't need 
To look so pleased

 

GLAMOROUS GLUE

First day with the jar 
You find 
Everyone lies 
First day with the jar 
You find 
Everyone lies, nobody minds, Everyone lies 
Where is the man you respect ? 
And where is the woman you love ? 
Where's the woman you love ? 
Third week with the jar
You find 
Everything dies 
We won't vote Conservative 
Because we never have 
Everyone lies, everyone lies 
Where is the man you respect ? 
And where is the woman you love ? 
Where's the woman you love ? 
Everything of worth 
On Earth, Is there, To share 
I used to dream, and I used to vow 
I wouldn't dream of it now 
We look to Los Angeles 
For the language we use 
London is dead, London is dead, London is dead, ...
Now I'm too much in love 
I'm too much in love, 
I know I'll go 
Empty hand 
From the land

 

WE HATE IT WHEN OUR FRIENDS BECOME SUCCESSFUL

We hate it when our friends become successful 
We hate it when our friends become successful 
Oh, look at those clothes 
Now look at that face, it's so old 
And such a video ! 
Well, it's really laughable 
Ha, ha, ha ...
We hate it when our friends become successful 
And if they're Northern, that makes it even worse
And if we can destroy them 
You bet your life we will 
Destroy them 
If we can hurt them 
Well, we may as well ... 
It's really laughable 
Ha, ha, ha ... 
You see, it should've been me 
It could've been me 
Everybody knows 
Everybody says so 
They say : 
"Ah, you have loads of songs 
So many songs 
More songs than they'd stand 
Verse 
Chorus 
Middle eight 
Break, fade 
Just listen ..."
La, la-la, la-la

 

NOW MY HEART IS FULL

There's gonna be some trouble 
A whole house will need re-building 
And everyone I love in the house 
Will recline on an analyst's couch quite 
Soon 
Your Father cracks a joke 
And in the usual way 
Empties the room 
Tell all of my friends 
(I don't have too many 
Just some rain-coated lovers' puny brothers)
Dallow, Spicer, Pinkie, Cubitt 
Rush to danger 
Wind up nowhere 
Patric Doonan - raised to wait 
I'm tired again, I've tried again, and 
Now my heart is full 
Now my heart is full 
And I just can't explain 
So I won't even try to
Dallow, Spicer, Pinkie, Cubitt 
Every jammy Stressford poet 
Loafing oafs in all-night chemists 
Loafing oafs in all-night chemists 
Underact - express depression 
Ah, but Bunnie I loved you 
I was tired again 
I've tried again, and 
Now my heart is full 
Now my heart is full 
And I just can't explain 
So I won't even try to 
Could you pass by ? 
Could you pass by ? 
Oh ... 
Now my heart is full 
Now my heart is full 
And I just can't explain 
So ... slow ... 
Slow ... slow ... slow ... slow ... slow ...

 

SPRING-HEELED JIM

Spring-heeled Jim winks an eye 
He'll "do", he'll never be "done to" 
He takes on whoever flew through 
"Well, it's the normal thing to do" ... ah ... 
Spring-heeled Jim lives to love 
Now kissing with his mouth full 
And his eyes on some other fool 
So many women 
His head should be spinning 
Ah, but no ! 
Ah, but no ! 
But no !
Ah, no !
Spring-heeled Jim slurs the words : 
"There's no need to be so knowing
Take life at five times the 
Average speed, like I do" 
Until Jim feels the chill 
"Oh, where did all the time go ?" 
Once always in for the kill 
Now it's too cold 
And he feels too 
old 
Too old
Mmm, old... 
La, la, la, la-la, la ...

 

BILLY BUDD

Say, Billy Budd 
So you think you should ? 
Oh, everyone's laughing 
Say, Billy Budd 
So you think that you should ? 
Everyone's laughing ! 
Since I took up with you 
Things have been bad 
Yeah, but now it's 12 years on 
Now it's 12 years on 
Yes, and I took up with you 
I took my job application 
Into town 
Did you hear ? They turned me down 
Yes, and it's all because of us 
Oh, and what was in our eyes 
Oh, what was in our eyes, yeah 
I said, Billy Budd 
I would happily lose 
Both of my legs 
I would lose both of my legs 
Oh, if it meant you could be free 
Oh, if it meant you could be free 
(Don't leave us in the dark!)

 

HOLD ON TO YOUR FRIENDS

A bond of trust 
Has been abused 
Something of value 
May be lost 
Give up your job 
Squander your cash - be rash 
Just hold on to your friends 
There are more than enough 
To fight and oppose 
Why waste good time 
Fighting the people you like 
Who will fall defending your name 
Oh, don't feel so ashamed 
To have friends 
But now you only call me 
When you're feeling depressed 
When you feel happy I'm 
So far from your mind 
My patience is stretched 
My loyalty vexed 
Oh, you're losing all of your friends 
Hold on to your friends 
Hold on to your friends 
Resist - or move on 
Be mad, be rash 
Smoke and explode 
Sell all of your clothes 
Just bear in mind : 
Oh, there just might come a time 
When you need some friends

 

THE MORE YOU IGNORE ME, THE CLOSER I GET

The more you ignore me 
The closer I get 
You're wasting your time 
The more you ignore me 
The closer I get 
You're wasting your time 
I will be 
In the bar 
With my head 
On the bar 
I am now 
A central part 
Of your mind's landscape 
Whether you care 
Or do not 
Yeah, I've made up your mind 
The more you ignore me 
The closer I get 
You're wasting your time 
The more you ignore me 
The closer I get 
You're wasting your time 
Beware !
I bear more grudges 
Than lonely high court judges 
When you sleep 
I will creep 
Into your thoughts 
Like a bad debt 
That you can't pay 
Take the easy way 
And give in 
Yeah, and let me in 
Oh, let me in 
Oh let me ... 
Oh, let me in 
IT'S WAR 
IT'S WAR 
WAR 
WAR 
Oh, let me in 
Ah, the closer I get 
Ah, you're asking for it 
Ah, the closer I get 
Ooh, the closer I ...

 

WHY DON'T YOU FIND OUT FOR YOURSELF

The sanest days are mad 
Why don't you find out for yourself ? 
Then you'll see the price 
Very closely 
Some men here 
They have a special interest 
In your career 
They wanna help you to grow 
And then syphon all your dough 
Why don't you find out for yourself ? 
Then you'll see the glass 
Hidden in the grass 
You'll never believe me, so 
Why don't you find out for yourself ? 
Sick down to my heart 
That's just the way it goes 
Some men here 
They know the full extent of 
Your distress 
They kneel and pray 
And they say : 
"Long may it last" 
Why don't you find out for yourself ?
Then you'll see the glass 
Hidden in the grass 
Bad scenes come and go 
For which you must allow 
Sick down to my heart 
That's just the way it goes 
Don't rake up my mistakes 
I know exactly what they are 
And ... what do YOU do ? 
Well ... you just SIT THERE 
I've been stabbed in the back 
So many many times 
I don't have any skin 
But that's just the way it goes

 

I AM HATED FOR LOVING

I am hated for loving 
I am hated for loving 
Anonymous call, a poison pen 
A brick in the small of the back again 
I still don't belong 
To anyone - I am mine 
And I am hated for loving 
I am haunted for wanting 
Anonymous call, a poison pen 
A brick in the ... ah ... 
A brick in the small of the back again 
I still don't belong 
To anyone - I am mine 
I am falling 
With no-one to catch me 
I am falling 
And there's still 
No-one to catch me 
Ah .. 
Anonymous call, a poison pen 
A brick in the ... ah ... 
A brick in the small of the back again 
I just don't belong 
To anywhere 
I just don't belong 
Mmm ... 
Ah ...

 

LIFEGUARD SLEEPING, GIRL DROWNING

Always looking for attention 
Always needs to be mentioned 
Who does she 
Think she should be ? 
The shrill cry through darkening air 
Doesn't she know he's 
Had such a busy day ? 
Tell her ... sshhh
Somebody tell her ... sshhh 
Slowest ... 
It was only a test 
But she swam too far 
Against the tide 
She deserves all she gets 
The sky became marked with stars 
As an out-stretched arm slowly 
Disappears 
Hooray 
Oh hooray 
No, oh, oh, woh, there's no movement 
No, oh, hooray 
Oh, hooray 
Please don't worry 
There'll be no fuss 
She was ... nobody's nothing 
(What's your name ?) 
When he awoke 
The sea was calm 
And another day passes like a dream 
There's no ... no way 
(What's your name ?)

 

USED TO BE A SWEET BOY

Used to be a sweet boy 
Holding so tightly 
To Daddy's hand 
But that was all 
In some distant land 
Blazer and tie 
And a big bright healthy smile 
Used to make all 
Of our trials worthwhile 
Used to be a sweet boy 
And I'm not to blame 
Something went wrong 
And I know 
I'm not to blame 
Something went wrong 
Can't be to blame 
Ah ...

 

THE LAZY SUNBATHERS

A world war 
Was announced 
Days ago 
But they didn't know 
The lazy sunbathers 
The lazy sunbathers 
The sun burns through 
To the planet's core 
And it isn't enough 
They want more 
Nothing 
Appears 
To be 
Between the ears of 
The lazy sunbathers 
Too jaded 
To question stagnation 
The sun burns through 
To the planet's core 
And it isn't enough 
They want more 
Religions fall 
Children shelled 
"...Children shelled ? That's all 
Very well, but would you 
Please keep the noise 
Down low ? 
Because you're waking 
The lazy sunbathers ..."
Oh, the lazy sunbathers 
The lazy sunbathers

 

SPEEDWAY

And when you slam 
Down the hammer 
Can you see it in your heart ? 
All of the rumours 
Keeping me grounded 
I never said, I never said that they were 
Completely unfounded 
So when you slam 
Down the hammer 
Can you see it in your heart ? 
Can you delve so low ? 
And when you're standing 
On my fingers 
Can you see it in your heart ? ... ah ... 
And when you try 
To break my spirit 
It won't work 
Because there's nothing left to break 
Anymore 
All of the rumours 
Keeping me grounded 
I never said, I never said that they were 
Completely unfounded 
You won't sleep 
Until the earth that wants me 
Finally has me 
Oh you've done it now 
You won't rest 
Until the hearse that becomes me 
Finally takes me 
Oh you've done it now 
And you won't smile 
Until my loving mouth 
Is shut good and proper 
FOREVER 
All of the rumours 
Keeping me grounded 
I never said, I never said that they were 
Completely unfounded 
And all those lies 
Written lies, twisted lies 
Well, they weren't lies 
They weren't lies 
They weren't lies 
I never said 
I never said 
I could have mentioned your name 
I could have dragged you in 
Guilt by implication 
By association 
I've always been true to you 
In my own strange way 
I've always been true to you 
In my own sick way 
I'll always stay true to you

 

THE TEACHERS ARE AFRAID OF THE PUPILS

There's too many people 
Planning your downfall 
When your spirit's on trial 
These nights can be frightening 
Sleep transports sadness 
To some other mid-brain 
And somebody here 
Will not be here next year 
So you stand by the board 
Full of fear and intention 
And, if you think that they're listening 
Well, you've got to be joking 
Oh, you understand change 
And you think it's essential 
But when your profession 
Is humiliation 
Say the wrong word to our children ...
We'll have you, oh yes, we'll have you 
Lay a hand on our children 
And it's never too late to have you 
Mucus on your collar 
A nail up through the staff chair 
A blade in your soap 
And you cry into your pillow 
To be finished would be a relief 
To be finished would be a relief... 
Say the wrong word to our children ...
We'll have you, oh yes, we'll have you 
Lay a hand on our children 
And it's never too late to have you 
To be finished would be a relief 
To be finished would be a relief...
I'm very glad this thing has come 
Sometimes I'm so glad 
Never bother to play the tunes 
I've seen it coming for dear life

 

READER MEET AUTHOR

You don't know a thing about their lives 
They live where you wouldn't dare to drive
You shake as you think of how they sleep 
But you write as if you are my side-by-side 
Reader, meet Author 
With the hope of hearing sense 
But you may be feeling let down 
By the words of defence 
He says : "No-one ever sees me when I cry"
You don't know a thing about their lives 
Books don't save them, books aren't Stanley knives 
And if a fight broke out here tonight 
You'd be the first away, because you're that type 
And the Year 2000 won't change anyone here 
As each fabled promise flies so fast 
You'll swear it was never there 
Oh, have you ever escaped from a shipwrecked life ? 
So safely with your software; all miles from the front line 
You hear the way their sad voices, and you start to imagine things 
Oh, any excuse to write more lies

THE OPERATION

You fight with your right hand 
And caress with your left hand 
Everyone I know is sick to death of you 
With a tear that's a mile wide 
In the kite that you're flying 
Everyone I know is sick to death of you 
Ever since 
You don't look the same 
You're just not the same, no way 
You say clever things and 
You never used to 
You don't catch what I'm saying 
When you're deafened to advice 
Everyone here is sick to the 
Back teeth of you 
With a tear that's a mile wide 
In the kite that you're flying 
Everyone here is sick to the 
Tattoo of you 
Ever since 
You don't look the same 
You're just not the same, no way 
You say pleasant things and 
There is no need to
Still, you fight with your right hand 
And caress with your left hand 
Ooh, ooh ... Sad to say ... 
How once I was in love with you 
Sad to say ... 
You don't catch what I'm saying 
When you're deafened to advice 
Ooh, ooh ... Ever since 
You don't look the same 
You're just not the same, no way 
What the hell have 
They stuck into you ?

 

DAGENHAM DAVE

Head in the clouds, and a mouthful of pie 
Head in a blouse, everybody loves him 
I see why 
Dagenham Dave, Dagenham Dave, Oh, Dagenham Dave 
Dagenham Dave, Dagenham Dave, Oh, Dagenham Dave 
"I love Karen, I love Sharon" on the windowscreen 
With never the need to fight or to question a single thing 
Dagenham Dave, Dagenham Dave Oh, Dagenham Dave 
Dagenham Dave, Dagenham Dave Oh, Dagenham Dave ...
He'd love to touch, he's afraid that he might self-combust 
I could say more, but you get the general idea 
Dagenham Dave, Dagenham Dave Dagenham Dave, Dagenham Dave 
Dagenham, Dagenham Dagenham Dave, Dagenham Dave ...
Oh, Dave, oh, Dagenham, dagenham, Oh, Dave, oh, Dave, ...

 

DO YOUR BEST AND DON'T WORRY

Compare the best of their days 
With the worst of your days 
You won't win 
With your standards so high 
And your spirits so low 
At least remember ... 
This is you on a bad day, you on a pale day 
Just do your best and don't ... Don't worry, oh 
The way you hang yourself is oh, so unfair 
See the best of how they look 
Against the worst of how you are
And again, you won't win 
With your standards so high 
And your spirits so low 
At least remember ... 
This is you on a drab day, you in a drab dress 
Just do your best and don't ... Don't worry, oh 
The way you hang yourself is oh, so unfair 
Just do your best and don't ... Don't worry, oh 
The way you watch yourself is oh, so unfair 
Just do your best and don't ... Don't worry, oh 
Do your best and don't ...

SOUTHPAW

You were a boy before you became a man 
I don't see the joy 
And you ran with your pals in the sun 
You turned around and they were gone 
Again ... 
A sick boy should be treated 
So easily defeated 
Oh, I just don't understand 
So you ran with your pals in the sun 
You turned around 
You were alone 
Again ... 
And you ran back to Ma 
Which set the pace for the rest of your days 
Oh, you ran back to Ma 
Which set the pace for the rest of your days 
Oh, you ran back to Ma 
Which set the pace for the rest of your days 
And now, there is something that you should know 
There is something that you should know 
The girl of your dreams is 
Here all alone 
Girl of your dreams is 
Here all alone 
The girl of your dreams is 
Sad and all alone 
The girl of your dreams is 
Here all alone 
There is something that you should know 
There is something that you should know 
Girl of your dreams is 
Here all alone 
The girl of your dreams is 
Sad and is all alone 
The girl of your dreams is 
Sad and is feeling all alone 
Oh, there is something that you should know 
Help me, help me, help me ...

 

MALADJUSTED

I wanna start from 
Before the beginning 
Loot wine, "Be mine, and 
Then let's stay out for the night"
Ride via Parkside 
Semi-perilous lives 
Jeer the lights in the windows 
Of all safe and stable homes 
(But wondering then, well what 
Could peace of mind be like ?)
Anyway do you want to hear 
Our story, or not ? 
As the Fulham Road lights 
Stretch and invite into the night 
From a Stevenage overspill 
We'd kill to live around 
SW6 - with someone like you 
Keep thieves' hours 
With someone like you 
...As long as it slides 
You stalk the house 
In a low-cut blouse : 
"Oh Christ, another stifled 
Friday night !"
And the Fulham Road lights 
Stretch and invite into the night 
Well, I was fifteen 
What could I know ?
When the gulf between 
All the things I need 
And the things I receive 
Is an ancient ocean 
Wide, wild, lost, uncrossed 
Still I maintain there's nothing 
Wrong with you 
You do all that you do 
Because it's all you can do 
Well, I was fifteen 
Where could I go ?
With a soul full of loathing 
For stinging bureaucracy 
Making it anything 
Other than easy 
For working girls like me 
With my hands on my head 
I flop on your bed 
With a head full of dread 
For all I've ever said 
Maladjusted, maladjusted 
Maladjusted maladjusted 
Never to be trusted 
Oh, never to be trusted 
There's nothing wrong with you, oh 
...There's nothing wrong with you

 

ALMA MATTERS

So : the choice I have made 
May seem strange to you 
But who asked you, anyway ? 
It's my life to wreck 
My own way 
You see : to someone, somewhere, oh yeah ... 
Alma matters 
In mind, body and soul 
In part, and in whole 
Because to someone, somewhere, oh yeah ... 
Alma matters 
In mind, body and soul 
In part, and in whole 
So the life I have made 
May seem wrong to you 
But, I've never been surer 
It's my life to ruin 
My own way 
You see : to someone, somewhere, oh yeah ... 
Alma matters 
In mind, body and soul 
In part, and in whole 
Because to someone, somewhere, oh yeah ... 
Alma matters 
In mind, body and soul 
In part, and in whole 
To someone, somewhere, oh yeah ... 
Alma matters 
In mind, body and soul 
Part, and in whole 
So to someone, somewhere, oh yeah ... 
Alma matters 
In mind, body and soul 
Part, and in whole 
To someone, somewhere, oh yeah ... 
Oh yeah ... Oh yeah, oh yeah Oh yeah ...

 

AMBITIOUS OUTSIDERS

Bolt-lock your doors 
Alarm your cars 
And still we move in closer 
Every day 
Top of the list 
Is your smiling kids 
But we'll be smiling too 
So that's OK 
Oh, and by the way 
Thank you, because you're 
Giving, giving, giving 
And we're receiving - 
No, no, we're taking 
Keeping the population down 
Your taxes paid, but 
Police waylaid 
And we knows 
When the school bus 
Comes and goes 
We're on your street, but 
You don't see us 
Or, if you do 
You smile and say Hello 
BUT DON'T UNDERESTIMATE US 
When you are 
Giving, giving, giving 
And we're receiving - 
No, no, we're taking 
Just keeping 
The population down 
You're giving, giving, giving 
Well, it's your own fault 
For reproducing 
We're just keeping 
The population down

 

TROUBLE LOVES ME

Trouble loves me 
Trouble needs me 
Two things 
More than you do 
Or would attempt to 
So, console me 
Otherwise, hold me 
Just when it seems like 
Everything's evened out 
And the balance 
Seems serene 
Trouble loves me 
Walks beside me 
To chide me 
Not to guide me 
It's still much more 
Than you'll do 
So, console me 
Otherwise, hold me 
Just when it seems like 
Everything's evened out 
And the balance seems serene 
See the fool I'll be 
Still running 'round 
On the flesh rampage 
Still running 'round 
Ready with ready-wit 
Still running 'round 
On the flesh rampage 
- At your age ! 
Go to Soho, oh 
Go to waste in 
The wrong arms 
Still running 'round 
Trouble loves me 
Seeks and finds me 
To charlatanize me 
Which is only 
As it should be 
Oh, please fulfill me 
Otherwise, kill me 
Show me a barrel and watch me scrape it 
Faced with the music, as always I'll face it 
In the half-light 
So English, frowning 
Then at midnight I 
Can't get you out of my head 
A disenchanted taste 
Still running 'round 
A disenchanted taste 
Still running 'round

 

PAPA JACK

Papa Jack 
Wants to turn 
Back the clock 
And reach out 
To the kids 
He once had 
Who have flown 
Papa Jack 
In decline 
Feels inclined 
To reach out 
To the kids 
He once had 
Who have flown 
But there was a time 
When the kids reached up 
And Papa Jack just 
Pushed them away 
Looking deep 
In his heart 
Papa Jack 
Doesn't like 
What he sees 
Or the time 
On his hands 
The dying day 
The chilly sun 
Papa Jack 
All alone 
Sings slow 
Grieving and low 
But there was a time 
When the kids reached up 
Now you can't always 
Have it your way 
Papa Jack 
Ah ...

 

AMMUNITION

I know these roads 
Each ridge 
And narrow bridge 
Each cheveron 
Enticing me on 
Each warning sign 
I take in my stride 
I don't need more ammunition 
I've got more than I can spend 
I don't dwell on things I'm missing 
I'm just pleased 
With the things I've found 
I know these roads 
An old hand understands 
Above all, I know what's 
Expected of me now 
Veering cliffwards 
I don't need more ammunition 
I've got more than I can spend 
I don't dwell on things I'm missing 
I'm just pleased 
With the things I've found 
With the things I've found 
With the things I've found 
I've found 
I've been crying 
It comes back on these salient days 
And it stays 
And it says : 
"We've never really been away" 
I don't need more ammunition 
I've got more than I can spend 
I don't think of who I'm missing 
I've got no space and no time 
In my life, anymore 
No space or time 
In my life, anymore 
For Revenge

 

WIDE TO RECEIVE

Download something 
Useful, or useless 
Because I'm lying here 
Wide to receive 
Almost anything 
You'd care to give 
And I don't 
Get along with myself 
And I'm not too keen 
On anyone else 
Turn on, plug in 
Then just walk away 
Unlock, process 
And then just go 
And I've never felt quite so alone 
As I do right now 
I'm lying here 
Wide to receive 
Almost anything 
You'd care to leave 
Wide, wide, wide Wide, wide, wide...

 

ROY'S KEEN

(GO ON !)
He's romancing you 
And chancing his arm 
He'll be here 
Smiling on time 
He's romancing you 
And chancing his arm 
He'll be here 
Smiling on time 
Roy's keen oh Roy's keen 
Roy's keen oh Roy's keen 
We've never seen a 
Keener window-cleaner 
Back up the ladder 
Into each corner 
Dunking the chamois 
Just think of the goodwill 
The ladder's a planet 
Roy is a star, and 
I am a satellite 
(But that's alright) 
He can hold a smile for as long 
As you require (even longer) 
He can hold a smile for as long 
As you require (even longer) 
Roy's keen oh Roy's keen 
Roy's keen oh Roy's keen 
We've never seen a 
Keener window-cleaner 
Back up the ladder 
Into each corner 
Dunking the chamois 
Just think of the goodwill 
The ladder's a planet 
Roy is a star, and 
I am a satellite 
I will be set alight 
Don't say you'll hold it steady 
Then you let it go 
Don't say you'll hold it steady 
Then you let it go Oh ...
You're up the ladder 
Into each corner 
Foot in a bucket 
We trust you to wreck it 
Even when it's under your nose 
Well, you just can't 
See it, can you ? 
Well, it's here 
Right under your nose 
And you just can't 
See it, can you? La la la la ...
Roy's keen, Roy's keen La la la la ...
We've never seen a 
Keener window-cleaner 
Oh ... La la la la ...

 

HE CRIED

I need you 
Simple words 
But words which had never been heard 
By the soul 
Stoned to death 
But still living 
And so he froze where he stood 
And he looked to the ground 
And he cried 
He cried 
Ride our minds 
If you must 
But there's always a line you don't cross 
Time is short 
Don't be cruel 
Oh you don't know the power 
In what you're saying 
Oh ... 
And so he froze where he stood 
And he looked to the ground 
And he cried 
He cried 
People where 
I come from 
They survive without feelings or blood 
I never could 
Was stoned to death 
But I'm still living 
So he froze where he stood 
And he looked to the ground 
And he cried 
He cried 
So he froze 
And he looked, and he looked 
To the ground 
And he cried 
He cried

 

SORROW WILL COME IN THE END

Legalized theft 
Leaves me bereft 
I get it straight in the neck 
(Somehow expecting no less) 
A court of justice 
With no use for Truth 
Lawyer ...liar 
Lawyer ...liar 
You pleaded and squealed 
And you think you've won 
But Sorrow will come 
To you in the end 
And as sure as my words are pure 
I praise the day that brings you pain 
Q.C.'s obsessed with sleaze 
Frantic for Fame 
They're all on the game 
They just use a different name 
You lied 
And you were believed 
By a J.P. senile and vile 
You pleaded and squealed 
And you think you've won 
But Sorrow will come 
To you in the end 
And as sure as my words are pure 
I praise the day that brings you pain 
So don't close your eyes 
Don't close your eyes 
A man who slits throats 
Has time on his hands 
And I'm gonna get you 
So don't close your eyes 
Don't ever close your eyes 
You think you've won 
OH NO

 

SATAN REJECTED MY SOUL

Satan rejected my soul 
He knows my kind 
He won't be dragged down 
He's seen my face around 
He knows Heaven doesn't seem 
To be my home 
So I must find 
Somewhere else to go 
So I must find 
Somewhere else to go 
So, take it - please 
It's free 
You'll never see 
You'll never see 
All the fun in life it's cost me 
Satan rejected my soul 
As low as he goes 
He never quite goes this low 
He's seen my face around 
He knows Heaven doesn't seem 
To be my home 
So I must find 
Somewhere else to go 
So I must find 
Somewhere else to go 
So, take it please 
It's really sly 
Come on, come on, ah Come on, come on, come on 
Take it please, It's really sly 
Come on, come on, ah Come on, come on, come on 
Call me in, Pull me in, call me in 
Come on, come on, oh Come on, come on, come on 
Pull me in, pull me in, Call me in, haul me in, pull me in 
Come on, come on, ah, Come on, come on 
La la la la la, Oh ...

 
 REEL AROUND THE FOUNTAIN

It's time the tale was told
of how you took a child
and you made him old
Reel around the fountain
slap me on the patio
I'll take it now
Fifteen minutes with you
well, I wouldn't say no
people said that you were virtually dead
and they were so wrong
fifteen minutes with you
well, i wouldn't say no
people said that you were easily led
and they were half-right
I dreamt about you last night
and i fell out of bed twice
you can pin and mount me like a butterfly
but take me to the haven of your bed
was something that you never said
two lumps, please
you're the bee's knees
but so am I
Meet me at the fountain
shove me on the patio
I'll take it slowly
Fifteen minutes with you
oh I wouldn't say no
people see no worth in you
oh but I do

 

YOU'VE GOT EVERYTHING NOW

As merry as the days were long
I was right and you were wrong
back at the old grey school
I would win and you would lose
But you've got everything now
and what a terrible mess I've made of my life
No, I've never had a job
because I've never wanted one
I've seen you smile
but I've never really heard you laugh
So who is rich and who is poor?
I cannot say...
You are your mother's only son
and you're a desperate one
But I don't want a lover
I just want to be seen in the back of your car
A friendship sadly lost?
Well, this is true ...and yet, it's false
Did I ever tell you , by the way
I never did like your face
But you've got everything now
and what a terrible mess I've made of my life
No, I've never had a job
because I'm too shy
But I don't want a lover
I just want to be tied to the back of your car.

 

MISERABLE LIE

So, goodbye
please stay with your own kind
and I'll stay with mine
There's something against us
it's not time
So, goodbye
I know I hardly say
how much I love your casual way
but please put your tongue away
a little higher and we're well away
the dark nights are drawing in
and your humour is as black as them
I look at yours, you laugh at mine
and"love" is just a miserable lie
you have destroyed my flower like-life
not once-but twice
you have corrupt my innocent mind
not once-but twice
I know that wind-swept mystical air
it means: I'd like to see your underwear
I recognise that mystical air
it means: I'd like to see your underwear
what do we get for the trouble and pain?
just a rented room in Whalley Range
into the depths of the criminal world
I followed her...
I need advice, I need advice
because nobody ever looks at me twice
I'm just a country-mile behind
the world
I'm just a country mile behind
the whole world
so take me when you go

 

PRETTY GIRLS MAKE GRAVES

Upon the sand,upon the bay
"there is a quick and easy way" you say
before you illustrate
I'd rather state:
"I'm not the man you think I am
I'm not the man you think I am "
And Sorrow's native son
he will not smile for anyone
And pretty girls makes the graves
End of the pier, end of the bay
you tug my arm and say:"Give into lust,
give up to lust, oh heaven knows we'll
soon be dust..."
But I'm not the man you think I am
I'm not the man you think I am
And Sorrow's native son
he will not rise for anyone
And pretty girls make graves
I could have been wild and I could have been free
but Nature played this trick on me
She wants it Now
and she will not wait
but she's too rough
and I'm too delicate
Then on the sand
another man, he takes her hand
and a smile lights up her stupid face
(and well, it would)
I lost my faith in Womanhood
I lost my faith in Womanhood, I lost my faith

 

THE HAND THAT ROCKS THE CRADLE

Please don't cry
the ghost and the storm outside
will not invade this sacred shire
nor infiltrate your mind
my life down I shall lie
if the bogey-man should try
to play tricks on your sacred mind
to tease, torment and tantalise
wavering shadows loom
a piano plays in an empty room
there'll be blood on the cleaver tonight
when darkness lifts and the room is bright
I'll still be by your side
for you are all that matters
and I'll love you till the day I die
there never need to be longing in your eyes
as long as the hand that rocks the cradle is mine
ceiling shadows shimmy by
and when the wardrobe towers like a beast of prey
there's a sadness in your beautiful eyes
you're untouched, unsoiled, wonderous eyes
my life down I shall lie
should restless spirts try
to play tricks on you sacred mind
but whom I never gave a name
I just looked into his wonderous eyes
and said" never never never again"
all too soon I did return
just like a moth to a flame
so rattle my bones all over the stones
because I'm only a beggar-man whom nobody owns
see how words as old as sin
fit me like a glove I'm here and here I'll stay
together we lie, together we pray
there never need be longing in your eyes
as long as the hand that rocks the cradle is mine

 

STILL ILL

I decree today that life
is simply taking and not giving
England is mine and it owes me a living
ask me why, and I'll spit in your eye
ask me why, and I'll spit in your eye
but we cannot cling to the old dreams anymore
no, we cannot cling to the old dreams anymore
Does the body rule the mind
or does the mind rule the body?
I dunno...
Under the iron bridge we kissed
and although I ended up with sore lips
it just wasn't like the old days anymore
no, it wasn't like those days
am I still ill?
Does the body rule the mind
or does the mind rule the body ?
I dunno...
Ask me why, and I'll die
ask me why, and I'll die
and if you must go to work tomorrow
well, if I were you I wouldn't bother
for there are brighter sides to life
and I should know because I've seen them
but not very often...
under the iron bridge we kissed
and although I ended up with sore lips
it just wasn't like the old days anymore
no, it wasn't like those days
am I still ill?

 

HAND IN GLOVE

Hand in glove
the sun shines out of our behinds
no, it's not like any other love
this one is different-because it's us
Hand in glove
we can go wherever we please
and everything depends upon
how near you stand to me
And if the people stare
then the people stare
I really don't know and I really don't care
Hand in glove
the Good People laugh
yes, we may be hidden by rags
but we have something they'll never have
So, hand in glove I stake my claim
I'll fight to the last breath
If they dare touch a hair on your head
I'll fight to the last breath
The Good Life is out there, somewhere
so stay on my arm, you little charmer
But I know my luck too well
and I'll probably never see you again.

 

WHAT DIFFERENCE DOES IT MAKE?

All men have secrets and here is mine
so let it be known
we have been through hell and high tide,
I can surely rely on you?
and yet you start to recoil,
heavy words are so lightly thrown
but still I'd leap in front of a flying bullet for you
So, what difference does it make?
so, what difference does it make?
it makes none
but you have gone
and you must be looking very old tonight
The devil will find work for idle hands to do
I stole and I lied, and why?
because you asked me to!
but now you make feel so ashamed
because I've only got two hands
well, I'm still fond of you
So, what difference does it make?
so, what difference does it make?
it makes none
but you have gone
and your prejudice won't keep you warm tonight
So, no more apologies
no more apologies
I'm too tired
I'm too sick and tired
and I'm feeling very sick and ill today
But I'm still fond of you

 

I DON'T OWE YOU ANYTHING

Bought on stolen wine
a nod was the first step
you know very well
what was coming next
did I really walk all this way
just to hear you say
"oh I don't want to go out tonight"
but you will
for you must
I don't owe you anything
but you owe me something
repay me now
you should never go to them
let them come to you
just like I do
you should not go to them
let them come to you
just like I do
Too freely on your lips
words prematurely said
oh but I know what will make you smile tonight
Life is never kind
life is never kind
oh but I know what will make you smile tonight

 

SUFFER LITTLE CHILDREN

Over the moors,take me to the moors
dig a shallow grave
and I'll lay me down
Lesley-Anne, with your pretty white beads
oh John, you'll never be a man
and you'll never see your home again
oh Manchester, so much to answer for
Edward, see those alluring lights?
tonight will be your very last night
a woman said "I know my son is dead
I'll never rest my hands on his scared head"
Hindley wakes and Hindley says:
"Wherever he has gone, I have gone "
But fresh lilaced moorland fields
cannot hide the stoild stench of death
Hindley wakes and Hindley says:
"Whatever he has done, I have done"
But this is no easy ride
for a child cries
"find me...find me, nothing more
we're on a sullen misty moor
we may be dead and we may be gone
but we will be right by your side
until the day you die
this is no easy ride
we will haunt you when you laugh
yes, you could say we're a team
you might sleep
BUT YOU WILL NEVER DREAM!"
Oh Manchester, so much to answer for
Oh Manchester, so much to answer for
Over the moor, I'm on the moor
the child is on the moor

 

THE HEADMASTER RITUAL

Belligerent ghouls

and he grabs and devours
I wanna go home
I don't want to stay

 

RUSHOLME RUFFIANS

The last night at the fair
by the big wheel generator
a boy is stabbed
and his money is grabbed
and the air hangs heavy like a dulling wine
she is famous
she is funny
an engagement ring
doesn't mean a thing
to a mind consumed by brass(money)
and though I walk home alone
my faith in love is still devout
the last night at the fair
from a seat on a whirling waltzer
her skirt ascends for a watching eye
it's a hideous trait( on her mother's side)
and though I walk home alone
my faith in love is still devout
then someone falls in love
and someone's beaten up
and the senses being dulled are mine
and someone falls in love
someone's beaten up
and the senses being dulled are mine
and though I walk home alone
my faith in love is still devout
this is the last night of the fair
and the grease in the hair
of a speedway operator
is all a tremulous heart requires
a schoolgirl is denied
she said "How quickly would I die
if I jumped from the top of the parachutes?"
this is the last night of the fair
and the grease in the hair

scratch my name on your arm with a fountain pen

I WANT THE ONE I CAN'T HAVE

On the day that your mentality
catches up with your biology
I want the one I can't have
and it's driving me mad
it's written all over my face
A double-bed
and a stalwart lover, for sure
these are the riches of the poor
A double-bed
and a stalwart lover, for sure
these are the riches of the poor
a tough kid who sometimes swallows nails
raised on Prisoner's Aid
he killed a policeman when he was thirteen
and somehow that really impressed me
it's written all over my face
On the day that your mentality
catches up with your biology
And if you ever need self-validation
just meet me in the alley by the
railway-station
it's written all over my face

 

WHAT SHE SAID

What she said:
"How come someone hasn't noticed
that I'm dead
and decided to bury me
God knows, I'm ready"
What she said was
but then, all the rejection she's had
to pretend to be happy

lover that she never had
What she read

she'd sit and prophesise

to really really open her eyes)

THAT JOKE ISN'T FUNNY ANYMORE

Park the car at the side of the road
you should know
time's tide will smother you
and I will too
when you laugh about other people who feel so
very lonely
their only desire is to die
well I'm afraid
it doesn't make me smile
I wish I could laugh
but that joke isn't funny anymore
it's too close to home and it's too near the bone
it's too close to home and it's too near the bone
more than you'll ever know
It was dark as I drove the point home
and on cold leather seats
well, it suddenly struck me
I just might die with a smile on my
face after all
I've seen this happen in other people's lives
and now it's happening in mine

 

NOWHERE FAST

I'd like to drop my trousers to the world
I am a man of means(of slender means)
each household appliance
is like a new science in my town
and if a day came when I felt a natural emotion
I'd get such a shock I'd probably jump in the ocean
and when a train goes by
it's such a sad sound
I'd like to drop my trousers to the Queen
every sensible child will know what this means
the poor and the needy
are selfish and greedy on her terms
and if the day came when I felt a natural emotion
I'd get such a shock I'd probably jump in the ocean
and when a train goes by
it's such a sad song
And when I'm lying in my bed
I think about life
and I think about death
and neither one particularly appeals to me
and if the day came when I felt a natural emotion
I'd get such a shock I'd probably lie
in the middle of the street and die
I'd lie down and die

 

WELL I WONDER

Well I wonder
do you hear me when you sleep?
I hoarsely cry
Well I wonder
do you see me when we pass?
I half-die
Please keep me in mind
please keep me in mind
Gasping-but somehow still alive
this is the fierce last stand of all I am
Gasping-dying-but somehow still alive
this is the final stand of all I am
Please keep me in mind

 

BARBARISM BEGINS AT HOME

Unruly boys
who will not grow up
must be taken in hand
Unruly girls
who will not settle down
they must be taken in hand
A crack on the head
is what you get for not asking
and a crack on the head
is what you get for asking

 

MEAT IS MURDER

Heifer whines could be human cries
closer comes the screaming knife
this beautiful creature must die
this beautiful creature must die
a death for no reason
and death for reason is MURDER
and the flesh you so fancifully fry
is not succulent, tasty or nice
it's death for no reason
and death for no reason is MURDER
and the calf that you carve with a smile
is MURDER
and the turkey you festively slice
is MURDER
do you know how animals die?
kitchen aroma aren't very homely
it's not "comforting," "cheery" or kind
it's sizzling blood and the unholy stench
of MURDER
it's not "natural," "normal" or kind
the fleas you so fancifully fry
as you savour the flavour
of MURDER
NO, NO, NO, IT'S MURDER
NO, NO, NO, IT'S MURDER
who hears when animals cry?

 

THE QUEEN IS DEAD

Farewell to this lands cheerless marches
hemmed in like a boar between arches
her very Lowness with her head in a sling
Im truely sorry-but it sounds like a wonderful thing
dear Charles, dont you ever crave
to appear on the front of the Daily mail
dressed in your Mother's bridal veil?
So, I checked all the registered historical facts
and I was shocked into shame to discover
how Im the 18th pale descendent
of some, old queen or other
has the world changed, or have I changed?
has the world changed, or have I changed?
as some 9-year old tough peddles drugs
(I never even knew what drugs were)
And so, I broke into the Palace
with a sponge and a rusty spanner
she said: "Eh, I know you, and you cannot sing"
I said: "that's nothing -you should hear me play piano"
We can go for a walk where it's quiet and dry
and we can talk about precious things
but when you are tied to your mother's apron
not one talks about castration
We can go for a walk where it's quiet and dry
and we can talk about precious things
like love and law and poverty
these are the things that kill me
We can go for a walk where it's quiet and dry
and we can talk about precious things
but the rain that flattens my hair
theses are the things that kill me
Passed the Pub that saps your body
and the church who'll snatch your money
the Queen is dead, boys
and it's so lonely on a limb
Pass the Pub that wrecks your body
and the church-all they want is your money
the Queen is dead, boys`
you can trust me, boys
life is very long, when you're lonely
life is very long, when you're lonely...

 

FRANKLY MR.SHANKLY

Frankly, Mr Shankly, this position Ive held
it pays my way, but it corrodes my soul
I want to leave you will not miss me
I want to go down in musical history
Frankly, Mr Shankly, Im a sickening wreck
Ive got the 21st Century breathing down my neck
I must move fast, you understand me
I want to go down in celluloid history
Fame, Fame, fatal Fame
it can play hideous tricks on the brain
but still I rather be Famous
than righteous or holy, any day
but sometimes Id feel more fulfilled
making Christmas cards with the mentally ill
I want to Live and I want to Love
I want to catch something that I might be ashamed of
Frankly, Mr Shankly, this position I've held
it pays my way and it corrodes my soul
oh, I didnt realise that you wrote poetry
(I didnt realise you wrote such bloody awful poetry)
Frankly, Mr Shankly, since you ask
you are a flatulent pain the arse
I do not mean to be so rude
but still, I must speck frankly, Mr Shankly

 

I KNOW IT'S ALL OVER

Oh Mother, I can fell the soil falling over my head
and as i climb into an empty bed
Oh well, Enough said
I know it's over-still I cling
I don't know where else I can go
Oh Mother, I can feel the soil falling over my head
see, the sea want s to take me
the knife wants to cut me
do you think you can help me?
Sad veiled bride, please be happy
handsome groom, give her room
loud, loutish lover, treat her kindly
(although she needs you
more than she loves you)
and I know it's over
and it never really began
but in my heart it was so real
and you even spoke to me and said:
"If you're so funny
then why are you on your own tonight?
and if you are so clever
then why are you on your own tonight?
if you're so terribly good looking
then why do you sleep alone tonight?
because tonight is just like any other night
that's why you're on your own tonight
with your triumphs and your charms
while they are in each other's arms.."
It's so easy to laugh
it's so easy to hate
it takes strength to be gentle and kind
It's so easy to laugh
it's so easy to hate
it takes guts to be gentle and kind
love is Natural and Real
but not for you, my love
not tonight my love
love is Natural and Real
but not for such as you and I, my love
Oh Mother, I can fell the soil falling over my head
Oh Mother, I can fell the soil falling over my head...

 

NEVER HAD NO ONE EVER

When you walk without ease
on these
the very streets where you were raised
I had a really bad dream
it lasted 20 years, 7 months, and 27 days
Never had no one ever.

 

CEMETERY GATES

A dreaded sunny day
so I meet you at the cemetry gates
Keats and Yeats are on your side
A dreaded sunny day
so I meet you at the cemetry gates
Keats and Yeats are on your side
while Wilde is on mine
So we go inside and we gravely read the stones
all those people all those lives
where are they now ?
with loves, and hates
and passions just like mine
they were born
and then they lived and then they died
which seems so unfair
and I wantr to crv
You say: "ere thrice the sun hath done salutation to the dawn"
and you claim these words as your own
but Im well-read, have heard them said
a hundred times (maybe less, maybe more)
if you must write prose/poems
the words you use should be your own
dont plagiarise or take "on loans"
there's alweays someone, somewhere
with a big nose, who knows
and who trips you up and laughs
when you fall
You say: "ere long done do does did "
words which could only be your own
you then produce the text
from whence was ripped
(some dizzy whore, 1804)
A dreaded sunny day
so let's go where we're happy
so I meet you at the cemetry gates
Keats and Yeats are on your side
A dreaded sunny day
so let's go where we're wanted
so I meet you at the cemetry gates
Keats and Yeats are on your side
but you lose
because Wilde is on mine

 

BIGMOUTH STRIKES AGAIN

Sweetness, sweetness I was only joking
when I said Id like to smash every tooth
in your head
Sweetness, sweetness I was only joking
when I said by right s you should be
bludgeoned in your bed
and now I know how Joan of Arc felt
now I know how Joan of Arc felt
as the flames roseto her roman nose
and her Walkman stared to melt
Bibmouth, bigmouth
bigmouth strikes again
and Ive got no right to take my place
with the Human race
and now I know how Joan of Arc felt
now I know of Joan of Arc felt
as the flames rose to her roman nose
and her hearing aid started to melt
Bigmouth, bigmouth
bigmouth strikes again
and Ive got no right to take my place
with the Human race

 

THE BOY WITH A THORN IN HIS SIDE

The boy with the thorn in his side
behind the hatred there lies
a murderous desire for love
how can they look into my eyes
and still they dont believe me
how can they hear me say those words
and still they dont believe me
and if they don't believe me now
will they ever believe me?
and if they don't believe me now
will they ever believe me?
The boy with the thorn in his side
behind the hatred there lies
a plundering desire for love
how can they see the Love in our eyes
and still they don't believe us
and after all this time
they don't want to believe us
and if they dont believe us now
will they ever believe us ?
andd when you want to Live
how do you start ?
where do you go ?
who do you know?

 

VICAR IN A TUTU

I was minding mind business
lifting some lead off
the roof of the Holy Name church
it was worthwhile living a laughable life
just to set my eyes on a blistering sight
of a vicar in a tu-tu
he's not strange
he just wants to live his life this way
a scanty bit of a thing
with a decorative ring
that wouldn't cover the head of a child
as Rose collects the money in the cannister
who comes sliding down the bannister
the vicar in a tu-tu
he's not strange
he just wants to live his life this way
the monkish monsignor
with a head full of plaster
said "my man, get your vile soul dry-cleaned"
as Rose counts the money in the cannister
as natural as rain
he dances again
vicar in a tu-tu
The next day in the pulpit
with Freedom and Ease
combating ignoranca,dust and disease
as Rose counts the money in the cannister
as natural as rain
he dances again
the fabric of a tu-tu
any man could get us to
and I am a living sign.

 

THERE IS A LIGHT THAT NEVER GOES OUT

Take me out tonight
where there's music and there's people
who are young and alive
driving in your car
I never never want to go home
because I havent got one
anymore
take me out tonight
because I want to see people and I
want to see lights
driving in your car
oh please dont drop me home
because it's not my home, it's their
home, and Im welcome no morw
and if a double-decker bus
crashes in to us
to die by your side
such a heavenly way to die
and if a ten ton truck
kills the both of us
to die by your side
the pleasure and the privilege is mine
take me out tonight
oh take me anywhere, I dont care
and in the darken underpass
I thought Oh God, my chance has come at last
(but then a strange fear gripped me and I just couldn't ask)
take me out tonight
take me anywhere, I dont care
just driving in your car
I never never want to go home
because I havent got one
I havent got one.

 

SOME GIRLS ARE BIGGER THAN OTHERS

From the ice-age to the dole-age
there is but one concern
and I have just discover
some girls are bigger than others
some girls are bigger than others
some girls mothers are bigger than
other girls mothers
As Anthony said to Cleopatra
as he opened a crate of ale:
some girls are bigger than others
some girls are bigger than others
some girls mothers are bigger than
other girls mothers.

 

A RUSH AND A PUSH AND AND THE LAND IS OURS

HELLO
I am the ghost of Troubled Joe
hung by his pretty white neck
some eighteen months ago
I travelled to a mystical time zone
but I missed my bed
so I soon came home
they said:
"there's too much caffeine
in your bloodstream
and a lack of real spice
in your life"
I said:
"leave me alone
because I'm alright, dad
just surprised to still
be on my own...."
Ooh, but don't mention love
I'd hate the real strain of the pain again
a rush and a push and the land that
we stand on is ours
it has been before
so it shall be again
and people who are uglier than you and I
they take what they need, and leave
Ooh, but don't mention love
I'd hate the pain and the strain all over again
a rush and a push and the land that
we stand on is ours
it has been before
so why can't it be now?
and people who are weaker than you and I
they take what they want from life
Ooh, but don't mention love
no - just don't mention love!
a rush and a push and the land that
we stand on is ours
your youth may be gone
but you're still a young man
so phone me, phone me, phone me
so phone me, phone me, phone me
Ooh, I think I'm in love...
Urrgh, I think I'm in lerv

 

I STARTED SOMETHING I COULDN'T FINISH

The lanes were silent
with nothing or no one around for miles
I doused our friendly venture
with a hard-faced
three-word gesture
I started something
I forced you into a zone
and you were clearly
never meant to go
hair brushed and parted
typical me, typical me, typical me
I started something
...and now I'm not too sure
I grabbed you by the guilded beams
that's what Tradition means
and I doused another venture
with a gesture
that was...absolutely vile
I started something
forced you to a zone
and you were clearly
never meant to go
hair brushed and parted
typical me, typical me, typical me
I started something
...and now I'm not too sure
I grabbed you by the guilded beams
that's what Tradition means
and now eighteen months' hard-labour
seems...fair enough
I started something
forced you to a zone
and you were clearly
never meant to go
hair brushed and parted
typical me, typical me, typical me
I started something
and now I'm not too sure

 

DEATH OF A DISCO DANCER

The death of a disco dancer
well, it happens a lot 'round here
and if you think Peace
is a common goal
well, that goes to show
just how little you know
The death of a disco dancer
well, I'd rather not get involved
I never talk to my neighbour
I'd just rather not get involved
Love, peace and harmony?
Love, peace and harmony?
Oh, very nice, very nice, very nice, very nice
...but maybe in the next world.

 

GIRLFRIEND IN A COMA

Girlfriend in a coma, I know
I know - it's serious
Girlfriend in a coma, I know
I know - it's really serious
there wree times when I could
have 'murdered' her
(but, you know, I would hate
anything to happen to her)
NO, I DON'T WANT TO SEE HER
Do you really think
she'll pull through?
Do you really think
she'll pull through?
Girlfriend in a coma, I know
I know, it's serious
there were time when I could
have 'strangeled' her
(but, you know, I would hate
anything to happen to her)
WOULD YOU PLEASE LET ME SEE HER!
Do you really think she'll pull through?
Do you really think she'll pull through?
Let me wisper my last goodbyes
I know - IT'S SERIOUS

 

STOP ME IF YOU'VE HEARD THIS ONE BEFORE

Stop me, stop me,
stop me if you think that you've heard this one before
stop me, stop me
stop me if you think that you've heard this one before
nothing's changed
I still love you, oh I still love you
...only slightly less than I used to
I was delayed, I was way-laid
an emergency stop
I smelt the last ten seconds of life
I crashed down on the crossbar
and the pain was enough to make
a shy, bald buddhist reflect
and plan a mass-murder
who said I'd lied to her?
who said I'd lied because I never
who said I'd lied because I never
I was detained, I was restrained
he broke my spleen
he broke my knees
(and then he really laid into me)
Friday night in Out-patients
who said I'd lied to her?
who said I'd lied - because I never
who said I'd lied - because I never
Oh, so I drank one
or was it four
and when I fell on the floor
...I drank more
stop me, stop me
stop me if you think that you've heard this one before
nothing's changed
I still love you, I still love you
but only slightly
less than I used to

 

LAST NIGHT I DREAMT THAT SOMEBODY LOVED ME

Last night I dreamt
that somebody loved me
no hope - but no harm
just another false alarm
Las night I felt
real arms around me
no hope - no harm
just another false alarm
so, tell me how long
before the last one?
and tell me how long
before the right one?
this story is old - I KNOW
but it goes on
this story is old - I KNOW
but it goes on

 

UNHAPPY BIRTHDAY

I've come to wish you an unhappy birthday
I've come to wish you an unhappy birthday
because you're evil
and you lie
and if you should die
I may feel slightly sad
(but I won't cry)
Loved and lost
and some may say
when usually its Nothing
surely you're happy
it should be this way?
I say "No, I'm gonna kill my dog"
and: "May the lines sag heavy
and deep tonight XXX"
I've come to wish you an unhappy birthday
I've come to wish you an unhappy birthday
because you're evil
and you lie
and if you should die
I may feel slightly sad
(But I won't cry)
Loved and lost
some people say
when usually its Nothing
surely you're happy
it should be this way?
I said "No"
and then I shot myself
so, drink, drink, drink
and be ill tonight
from the one you left behind
from the one you left behind...

 

PAINT A VULGAR PICTURE

At the record company meeting
On their hands - a dead star
and ooh, the plans that they weave
and ooh, the sikening greed
At the record company meeting
on their hands - a dead star
the sycophantic slags all say:
"I knew him first, and I knew him well"
Re-issue! Re-package! Re-package!
Re-evaluate the songs
double-pack with a photograph
Extra Track (and a tacky badge)
A-list, playlist
"Please them, please them!"
"Please them! Please them!"
(sadly, THIS was your life)
but you could have said no
if you'd wanted to
you could have said no
if you'd wanted to
BPI, MTV, BBC
"Please them! Please them!"
(sadly this was your life)
but you could have said no
if you'd wanted to
you could have walked away
...couldn't you?
I touched you at the soundcheck
you had no real way of knowing
in my heart I bgged "please, take
me with you...
I don't care where you're going"
But to you I was faceless
I was fawning, I was boring
just a child from those ugly new houses
who could never begin to know
who could never really know
Best of? Most of?
Satiate the need
slip them into different sleeves!
Buy both, and be decieved
climber - new entry, re-entry
World tour! ("media whore")
"Please the Press in Belgium!"
(THIS was your life...)
and when it fails to recoup?
Well, maybe:
You just haven't earned it yet, baby
I walked a pace behind you at the soundcheck
you're just the same as I am
what makes most people feel happy
leads us headlong into harm
so, in my bedroom in those 'ugly new houses'
I dance my legs down to the knees
but me and my 'true love'
we will never meet again...
At the record company meeting
on their hands - at last! - a dead star!
but they cannot taint you in my eyes
no, they cannout touch you now
No, they cannot hurt you my darling
they cannot touch you now
but me and my 'true love'
will never meet again

 

DEATH AT ONE'S ELBOW

Ooh Glenn, don't come to the house tonight
Ooh, Glenn, don't come to the house tonight
because there's somebody here
who really really loves you
stay home
be bored
(it's crap, I KNOW)
Ooh, Glenn, don't come to the house tonight
Ooh, Glen, don't come to the house tonight
because there's somebody here
who'll take a hatchet to your ear
how the frustration renders me
hateful, Glenn!
don't come to the house tonight
don't come to the house tonight
because you'll slip on the
trail of my bespattered remains
and so, that's why
GOODBYE MY LOVE, GOODBYE MY LOVE, GOODBYE MY LOVE...
Belch

 

I WON'T SHARE YOU

I won't share you
I won't share you
with the drive and ambition
and the zeal I feel
this is my time
as the note I wrote
was read, she said
has the Perrier gone
straight to my head
or is life plainly sick and cruel, instead?
"YES!"
No-no-no-no-no-no
I won't share you
I won't share you
with the drive and the dreams inside
this is my time
Life tends to come and go
well, that's OK
just as long as you know
Life tends to come and go
well, that's OK
just as long as you know
I won't share you
I won't share you
with the drive and the dreams inside
this is my time, this is my time

PANIC

Panic on the streets of London
Panic on the streets of Birmingham
I wonder to myself
Could life ever be sane again
on the Leeds side-streets that you slip down
I wonder to myself
Hopes may rise on the Grasmeres
But Honey Pie, you're not safe here
So you run down
To the safety of the town
But there's Panic on the streets of Carlisle
Dublin, Dundee, Humberside
I wonder to myself
Burn down the Disco
Hang the blessed D.J.
Because the music that they constantly play
IT SAYS NOTHING TO ME ABOUT MY LIFE
Hang the blessed D.J.
Because the music they constantly play
On the Leeds side-streets that you slip down
On the provincial towns that you jog 'round
Hang the D.J.,. Hang the D.J.,.Hang the D.J...

ASK

Shyness is nice, but
Shyness can stop you
From doing all the things in life
That you'd like to
So, if there's something you'd like to try
ASK ME-I WON'T SAY "NO"-HOW COULD I?
Coyness is nice, but ,
Coyness can stop you
from saying all the things in
life that you want to
If there's something that you'd like to try
ASK ME-I WON'TSAY"NO"-HOW COULD I?
Spending warm, Summer days indoors
Writing fringhtening verse
To a buck-toothed girl in Luxembourg
ASK ME, ASK ME ,ASK ME, ASK ME, ASK ME ,ASK ME
Because if it's not Love
Then it's the Bomb
That will bring us together
Nature is a language-can't you read?
Nature is a language-can't you read?
ASK ME, ASK ME ,ASK ME, ASK ME, ASK ME ,ASK ME

MARIE'S THE NAME (HIS LATEST FLAME) / RUSHOLME RUFFIANS

Very old friend 
Came by today 
As he was telling everyone in town 
Of all the love that he'd just found 
And Marie's the name (of his latest flame) 
Talked and talked 
And I heard him say 
That she had the longest blackest hair 
Prettiest green eyes anywhere 
And Marie's the name (of his latest flame) 
The last night of the fair 
By the big wheel generator 
A boy is stabbed 
His money is grabbed 
And the air hangs heavy like a dulling wine 
She is Famous 
She is Funny 
An engagement ring 
Doesn't mean a thing 
To a mind consumed by brass (money), oh 
The last night of the fair 
From a seat on a whirling waltzer 
Her skirt ascends for a watching eye 
It's a hideous trait (on her mother's side)
From a seat on a whirling waltzer 
Her skirt ascends for a watching eye 
A hideous trait (on her mother's side) 
Then someone falls in love 
Someone's beaten up 
Someone's beaten up 
And the senses being dulled are mine 
And someone falls in love 
Someone's beaten up 
And the senses being dulled are mine 
This is the last night of the fair 
And the grease in the hair 
Of a speedway operator 
Is all a tremulous heart requires 
A schoolgirl is denied 
She said : "How quickly would I die 
If I jumped from the top of the parachutes ?"
This is the last night of the fair 
And the grease in the hair 
Of a speedway operator 
Is all a tremulous heart requires 
A schoolgirl is denied 
She said : "How quickly would I die 
Oh, if I jumped from the top of the parachutes ?"
...Oh, walk home alone 
I might walk home alone 
But my faith in love is still devout

 

THE BOY WITH THE THORN IN HIS SIDE

The boy with the thorn in his side
behind the hatred there lies
a murderous desire for love
how can they look into my eyes
and still they dont believe me
how can they hear me say those words
and still they dont believe me
and if they don't believe me now
will they ever believe me?
and if they don't believe me now
will they ever believe me?
The boy with the thorn in his side
behind the hatred there lies
a plundering desire for love
how can they see the Love in our eyes
and still they don't believe us
and after all this time
they don't want to believe us
and if they dont believe us now
will they ever believe us ?
andd when you want to Live
how do you start ?
where do you go ?
who do you know?

 

RUBBER RING / WHAT SHE SAID

Yeah! What she says : 
"How come someone hasn't noticed 
That I'm dead 
And decided to bury me ? 
God knows, I'm ready !"
La-la-la ... 
What she said was sad 
But then, all the rejection she's had 
To pretend to be happy 
Could only be idiocy 
La-la-la ... 
What she said was not for the job or 
Lover that she never had 
No no no ... 
What she read 
All heady books 
She'd sit and prophesise 
(It took a tattooed boy from 
Birkenhead 
To really really open her eyes)
What she read 
All heady books 
She'd sit and prophesise 
(It took a tattooed boy from 
Birkenhead 
To really really open her eyes)
What she said : 
"I smoke because I'm hoping for an 
Early death 
AND I NEED TO CLING TO SOMETHING !"
What she said : 
"I smoke because I'm hoping for an 
Early death

No no no no ...

 

IS IT REALLY SO STRANGE?

I left the North 
I travelled South 
I found a tiny house 
And I can't help the way I feel 
Oh yes, you can kick me 
And you can punch me 
And you can break my face 
But you won't change the way I feel 
'Cause I love you, Oh ... 
And is it really so strange ? 
Oh, is it really so strange ? 
Oh, is it really so, really so strange ? 
I say NO, you say YES 
(and you will change your mind) 
I left the South 
I travelled North 
I got confused - I killed a horse 
I can't help the way I feel 
Oh yes, you can punch me 
And you can butt me 
And you can break my spine 
But you won't change the way I feel 
'Cause I love you, Oh ... 
And is it really so strange ? 
Oh, is it really so strange ? 
Oh, is it really so, really so strange ? 
I say NO, you say YES 
(But you will change your mind) 
I left the North again 
I travelled South again 
And I got confused - I killed a nun 
I CAN'T HELP THE WAY I FEEL 
(I lost my bag in Newport Pagnell) 
Why is the last mile the hardest mile ? 
My throat was dry, with the sun in my eyes 
And I realised, I realised 
I could never 
I could never, never, never, go back home again

 

CEMETERY GATES

A dreaded sunny day
so I meet you at the cemetry gates
Keats and Yeats are on your side
A dreaded sunny day
so I meet you at the cemetry gates
Keats and Yeats are on your side
while Wilde is on mine
So we go inside and we gravely read the stones
all those people all those lives
where are they now ?
with loves, and hates
and passions just like mine
they were born
and then they lived and then they died
which seems so unfair
and I wantr to crv
You say: "ere thrice the sun hath done salutation to the dawn"
and you claim these words as your own
but Im well-read, have heard them said
a hundred times (maybe less, maybe more)
if you must write prose/poems
the words you use should be your own
dont plagiarise or take "on loans"
there's alweays someone, somewhere
with a big nose, who knows
and who trips you up and laughs
when you fall
You say: "ere long done do does did "
words which could only be your own
you then produce the text
from whence was ripped
(some dizzy whore, 1804)
A dreaded sunny day
so let's go where we're happy
so I meet you at the cemetry gates
Keats and Yeats are on your side
A dreaded sunny day
so let's go where we're wanted
so I meet you at the cemetry gates
Keats and Yeats are on your side
but you lose
because Wilde is on mine

 

LONDON

Smoke
Lingers 'round your fingers
Train
Heave on - to Euston
Do you think you've made
The right decision this time?
You left
Your tired family grieving
And you think they're sad because you're leaving
But didn't you see the Jealousy in the eyes
Of the ones who had to stay behind?
And do you think you've made
The right decision thins time?
You left
Your girlfriend on the platform
With thei really ragged notion that you'll return
But she knows
That when he goes
He really goes
So do you think you've made
The right decision this time?

 

I KNOW IT'S OVER

I can feel the soil falling over my head 
And as I climb into an empty bed 
Oh well. Enough said. 
I know it's over - still I cling 
I don't know where else I can go 
Over ... 
Oh Mother, I can feel the soil falling over my head 
See, the sea wants to take me 
The knife wants to cut me 
Do you think you can help me ? 
Sad veiled bride, please be happy 
Handsome groom, give her room 
Loud, loutish lover, treat her kindly 
(Though she needs you 
More than she loves you) 
And I know it's over - still I cling 
I don't know where else I can go 
Over, it's over, it's over, it's over 
It's over, la ... 
I know it's over 
And it never really began 
But in my heart it was so real
And you even spoke to me, and said : 
"If you're so funny 
Then why are you on your own tonight ? 
And if you're so clever 
Then why are you on your own tonight ? 
I know ... 
'Cause tonight - it's just like any other night 
That's why you're on your own tonight 
Your triumphs and your charms 
While they're in each other's arms..."
It's so easy to laugh 
It's so easy to hate 
It takes strength to be gentle and kind 
Over, over, over, over 
It's so easy to laugh 
It's so easy to hate 
It takes guts to be gentle and kind 
Over, over 
Love is Natural and Real 
But not for you, my love 
Not tonight, my love 
Love is Natural and Real 
But not for such as you and I, my love 
Oh Mother, I can feel the soil falling over my head...
Oh Mother, I can feel the soil fall over, fall over my head 
Oh Mother, I can feel the ... fall over my ... , Oh ...

 

THE DRAIZE TRAIN

A vastly superior version of the instrumental B-side, acting as a peace 
offering to Marr (Morrissey chose the tracks for the compilation, 
and of course, receives no royalties on this track).

 

STILL ILL

I decree today that life
is simply taking and not giving
England is mine and it owes me a living
ask me why, and I'll spit in your eye
ask me why, and I'll spit in your eye
but we cannot cling to the old dreams anymore
no, we cannot cling to the old dreams anymore
Does the body rule the mind
or does the mind rule the body?
I dunno...
Under the iron bridge we kissed
and although I ended up with sore lips
it just wasn't like the old days anymore
no, it wasn't like those days
am I still ill?
Does the body rule the mind
or does the mind rule the body ?
I dunno...
Ask me why, and I'll die
ask me why, and I'll die
and if you must go to work tomorrow
well, if I were you I wouldn't bother
for there are brighter sides to life
and I should know because I've seen them
but not very often...
under the iron bridge we kissed
and although I ended up with sore lips
it just wasn't like the old days anymore
no, it wasn't like those days
am I still ill?

 

BIGMOUTH STRIKES AGAIN

Sweetness, sweetness I was only joking
when I said Id like to smash every tooth
in your head
Sweetness, sweetness I was only joking
when I said by right s you should be
bludgeoned in your bed
and now I know how Joan of Arc felt
now I know how Joan of Arc felt
as the flames roseto her roman nose
and her Walkman stared to melt
Bibmouth, bigmouth
bigmouth strikes again
and Ive got no right to take my place
with the Human race
and now I know how Joan of Arc felt
now I know of Joan of Arc felt
as the flames rose to her roman nose
and her hearing aid started to melt
Bigmouth, bigmouth
bigmouth strikes again
and Ive got no right to take my place
with the Human race

 
ALSATIAN COUSTIN

Were you and he Lovers?
and would you say so if you were?
on a forecourt
on a Friday
passing my way
Were you and he Lovers?
and if you were, then say that you were!
on a groundsheet
under canvas
with your tent-flap
open wide
A note upon his desk:
"P.S. Bring Me Home And Have Me!"
Leather elbows on a tweed coat
- Oh! -
Is THAT the best you can do?
So came his reply:
"...but on the desk is where I want you!"
So I ask (even though I know):
were you and he Lovers?

 

LITTLE MAN, WHAT NOW?

An afternoon nostalgia
television show
you spoke in silhouette
(but they couldn't name you)
although the panel were
very polite to you
but I remembered you
from Friday nights 1969
ATV - you murdered every line
too old to be a child star
too young to take leads
four seasons passed
and they AXED you
nervously juvenile
(WON'T SMILE!)
What became of you?
did that swift eclipse torture you?
a star at eighteen
and then-suddenly gone
down to a few lines
in the back page of a teenage annual
oh but I remembered you
I looked up to you

 

EVERYDAY IS LIKE SUNDAY

Trudging slowly over wet sand
back to the bench
where your clothes were stolen
this is the coastal town
that they forgot to close down
Armageddon - come Armageddon!
Come Armageddon! Come!
Everyday is like Sunday
everyday is silent and grey
Hide on the promenade
scratch out a postcard
"how I dearly with I was not here"
in the seaside town
...that they forgot to bomb
Come! Come! Come - nuclear bomb!
Everyday is like Sunday
everyday is silent and grey
Trudging back over pebbles and sand
and a strange dust lands on your hands
(and on your face)
Everyday is like Sunday
"Win Yourself A Cheap Tray"
share some greased tea with me
everyday is silent and grey

 

BENGALI IN PLATFORMS

No no no
he does not want to depress you
oh no no no no no
he only wants to impress you
Bengali in platform
she only wants to embrace your culture
and to be your friend forever
Bengali, Bengali
oh shelve your Western plans
and understand that life is hard enough when you belong here
A silver-studded rim that glistens
and an ankle-star that...blinds me
a lemon sole so very high
which only reminds me, to tell you
so I break the news gently
I break the news to you gently
"Shelve your plans"
Bengali, Bengali
its the touchy march of time
that blinds you
don't blame me
don't hate me
just because I'm the one to tell you
that life is hard enough when you belong here
life is hard enough when you belong here
shelve your western plans
life is hard enough when you belong here

 

ANGEL, ANGEL, DOWN WE GO TOGETHER

Angel, Angel
don't take your life tonight
I know they take
and that they take in turn
and they give you nothing real
for yourself in return
and when they've used you
and they've broken you
and wasted all your money
and cast your shell aside
and when they've bought you
and they've sold you
and they've billed you for the pleasure
and they've made your parents cry
I will be here
BELIEVE ME
I will be here
...believe me
Angel, don't take your life
some people have got no pride
they do not understand
the Urgency of life
but I love you more than life
I love you more than life
I love you more than life
I love you more than life

 

LALE NIGHT, MAUDLIN STREET

The last night on Maudlin Street
goodbye house
goodbye stairs
I was born here
I was raised here, and
...I took some stick here
love at first sight
may sound trite
but it's true, you know
I could list the details
of everything you ever wore
or said, or how you stood that day
and as we spend the last night
on Maudlin Street, I say
"goodbye house-forever!"
I never stole a happy hour
around here
Where the world's ugliest boy
became what you see
here I am - the ugliest man
Its the last night on Maudlin Street
and truly I do love you
oh, truly I do love you
When I sleep with that picture of
you framed beside my bed
oh, it's childish and it's silly
but I think it's you in my room
by the bed (...yes, I told you it was silly...)
and I know
I took strange pills
but I never meant to hurt you
oh truly I love you
I came home late one night
everyone had gone to bed
nobody stays up for you
when you have sixteen stitches
all around your head
the last buss I missed to Maudlin Street
so, he drove me home in the Van
complaining: "Women only like me for my mind..."
don't leave your torch behind
power-cuts ahead
as we crept through the park
but no I cannot steal a pair of jeans
off a clothesline for you
but you...without clothes
oh I could not keep a straight face
me - without clothes?
well a nation turns its back and gags...
I'm packed
I am moving house
a half-life disappears today
every slag waves me on
(secretly wishing me gone
well, I will be soon
oh - I will be soon)
There were bad times on Maudlin Street
when they took you away in a police car
dear Inspector - don't you know?
don't you care?
don't you know - about Love?
Your gran died
and your mother died
on Maudlin Street
in pain and ashamed
with never time to say
those special things
I took the keys from Maudlin Street
well, it's only bricks and mortar!
and...truly I do love you
wherever you are
wherever you are

 

SUEDHEAD

Why do you come here
why do you hang around
I'm so sorry
I'm so sorry
Why do you come here
when you know it makes
things hard for me
when you know, oh
why do you come?
Why do you telephone?
and why send me silly notes?
I'm so sorry
I'm so sorry
why do you come here
when you know it makes
thing hard for me
when you know, oh
why do you come?
You had to sneak into my room
'just' to read my diary
was it just to see all the things
you knew I'd written about you?
and...so many illustrations
I'm so very sickened
oh, I am so sickened NOW

 

BREAK UP THE FAMILY

The strange logic of your clumsiest line
stayed emblazoned on my mind
break up the family
and lets begin to live our lives
I went to see all my friends tonight
it wasn't Youth, it wasn't even Life
born Old, sadly wise
resigned (well, we were)
to ending our lives
I'm so glad to grow older
to move away from those awful times
I want to see all my friends tonight
Yes you found love but you weren't
at peace with your life
home late, full of Hate
despise the ties that bind
oh I'm so glad to grow older
to move away from those younger years
now I'm in love for the first time
and I don't feel bad
Let me see all my old friends
let me put my arm around them
because I really do love them
now, does that sound mad?
Captain of games, solid framed
I stood on the touchline
hailstones, driven home
in his car - no breaks? I don't mind
I'm just so glad to grow older
to move away from those darker years
I'm in love for the first time
and I don't feel bad
so wish me luck my friends
goodbye

 

HAIRDRESSER ON FIRE

Here is London
here is London
is it home of the free,
or what?
can you squeeze me
into an empty page of your diary
and psychologically save me
I've got faith in you
I sense the power
in the fingers
within an hour the power
can totally destroy me
or it could same my life
here is London
'home of the brash, outrageous
and free'
you are repressed
but you're remarkably dressed
is it Real?
but you're far to busy
busy scissors
busy clippers
hair dresser on fire
all around Sloane Square
and you're far too busy
to see me
"busy,busy"
hairdresser on fire
was a client over-cautious
he made you nervous
and when he said
"I'm gonna sue you"
I really felt for you
so can you squeeze me
into an empty page of your diary
and supernaturally change me
CHANGE ME, CHANGE ME

 

THE ORDINARY BOYS

Ordinary boys, happy knowing nothing
happy being no one, but themselves
Ordinary girls, supermarket clothes
who think it's very clever to be cruel to you
for you were so different
you stood all alone
and you knew
that it had to be so
avoiding ordinary boys
happy going nowhere, just around here
in their rattling cars
and ordinary girls
never seeing further
than the cold, small streets
that trap them
but you were so different
you had to say no
when those empty fools
tried to change you, and claim you
for the lair of their ordinary world
where they feel so lucky
so lucky, so lucky
with their lives laid out before them
they're so lucky, so lucky
so lucky, so lucky

 

I DON'T MIND IF YOU FORGET ME

I don't mind
I don't mind if you forget me
having learned my lesson
I never left an impression on anyone
so now you send me your hardened 'regards'
when once you'd send me 'love'
sincerely I must tell you
your mild 'best wishes'
they make me suspicious
but I don't mind
I don't mind if you forget me
having learned my lesson
I never left
an impression on anyone
the pressure to change, to move on
was strange
and very strong
so this is why I tell you
I really do understand
BYE BYE
I don't mind if you forget me
no no no no no no no
REJECTION IS ONE THING
BUT REJECTION FROM A FOOL
IS CRUEL
REJECTION IS ONE THING
BUT REJECTION FROM A FOOL
IS CRUEL
and I don't mind if you forget me
I don't mind if your forget me

 

DIAL-A-CLICHE

Further into the fog I fall
well, I was just
following you!
when you said:
"Do as I do and scrap your fey ways"
(dial-a-cliche)
"grow up, be a man, and close your mealy-mouth!"
(dial-a-cliche)
But the person underneath
where does he go?
does he slide by the wayside?
or...does he just die?
when you find that you've organized
your feelings, for people
who didn't like you then
and certainly don't like you now
yet still you say:
"Do as I do and scrap your fey ways"
(dial-a-cliche)
"grow up, be a man, and close your mealy-mouth!"
(dial-a-cliche)
"the Safe way is the only way!
there's always time to change, son!"
yes well I've changed
but I'm in pain!
dial-a-chiche

 

MARGARET ON THE GUILLOTINE

The kind people
have a wonderful dream
Margaret on the guillotine
because people like you
make me feel so tired
when will you die?
when will you die?
when will you die?
when will you die?
when will you die?
because people like you
make me feel so old inside
please die
and kind people
do not shelter this dream
make it real
make the dream real
make the dream real
make it real

 

OUR FRANK

Our frank and open
deep conversations
they get me nowhere
they bring me down, so
give it a rest, won't you?
give me a cigarette
God give me patience
just no more conversation
Give us a drink
and make it quick
or else I'm gonna be sick
sick all over
your frankly vulgar
red pullover
now see how the colours blend
Our frank and open
deep conversations
they get me nowhere
they bring me down, so
give it a rest, won't you?
now will you just give over
the world may be ending
but look, I'm only human
Give us a drink
and make it quick
or else I'm gonna be sick
all over
your frankly vulgar
red pullover
now see how the two colours blend
Won't somebody stop me
from thinking all the time
about everything
so deeply
so bleakly

 

ASIAN RUT

Day oh so late
strangely the sun still shone
oh Asian boy
what are you on?
Day oh so late
strangely the sun still shone
what drugs are you on?
Tooled-up Asian boy
has come here to avenge
the cruel, cold killing
of his very best friend
Tooled-up Asian boy
has come here to take revenge
for the cruel, cold killing
of his only friend
Peace through the school
so quiet in the hall
it's a strange sign for one
of what's to come
Tough and hard and pale
oh they may just impale you on railings
oh English boys
it must be wrong
three against one?
Brakes slammed, and
a gun jammed, and
as far as I could tell
brave Asian boy
dealt a blow and fell
I'm just passing through here
on my way to somewhere civilised
and maybe I'll even arrive
maybe I'll even arrive?

 

SING YOUR LIFE

Sing your life
any fool can think of words that rhyme
many others do
why don't you?
do you want to?
Sing your life
just walk right up to the microphone
and name
all the things that you love
all the things that you loathe
sing your life
all the things that you love
all the things that you loathe
oh sing your life
oh sing your life
Others sang your life
but now's your chance to shine
and have the pleasure of
saying what you mean
the rare pleasure of
meaning what you sing
oh, make no mistake, my friend
all of this will end
so sing it now
all the things you love
all the things you loathe
oh sing your life
all the things that you love
all the things that you loathe
oh sing your, oh sing your
Don't leave it all unsaid
somewhere in the wasteland of your head
and make no mistake, my friend
your pointless life will end
but before you go
can you look at the truth?
You have a lovely singing voice
a lovely singing voice
and all of those
who sing on key
they stole the notion
from you and me

 

MUTE WITNESS

Your poor witness
crying so loudly on the floor
oh but she's only trying to tell you
what it was that she saw
she is only trying to tell you
what it was that she saw
Now see her standing on the table
with her small arms flailing
and you feel such compassion
in your soul for
Your poor mute witness
still testing the strength
of our patience
oh but she's only trying to tell you
what it was that she saw
Now see her pointing to the frisbee
with a memory too fuzzy
as her silent words
describe the fright of last night
4 a.m. Norhtside, Clapham Common
who knows what she was doing there?
will she sketch the answer later?
Well, I'll ask her
"now dry your tears, my dear"
Now see her mime in time so nicely
it would all have been so clear
is only she had never volunteered
"your taxi is here, my dear"

 

KING LEER

Your boyfriend, he
went down on one knee
well, could it be
he's only got one knee?
I tried to surprise you
with Vodka
or, Tizer
I can't quite remember
but you didn't thank me
you didn't even thank me
because you never do
Your boyfriend, he
has the gift of the gab
or, could it be
the gift of the grab?
I tried to surprise you
I lay down beside you
and...nothing much happened
and you didn't phone me
you didn't even phone me
because it's not your style
to dial
Your boyfriend, he
displays to me
more than just
a hint of cruelty
I tried to surprise you
I crept up behind you
with a homeless chihuahua
you gushed for an hour
you handed him back and said
"You'll never guess
I'm bored now"

 

FOUND FOUND FOUND

found found found found found found
someone who's worth it
in this murkiness
someone who's never
seeming scheming
found found found found found found
someone who's worth it
in this murkiness
someone who's never
seeming scheming
Oh, but if I'd never found
oh, but if I'd never found
oh, but if I'd never found
I do believe that
the more you give your love
and I do believe that
the more you offer trust
the more you chase
the more you cry
the more you're bound to lose
the more you're bound to lose
Oh, but if I'd never found
oh, but if I'd never found
somebody
who wants to be
who wants to be
with me
all the time

 

DRIVING YOUR GIRLFRIEND HOME

I'm driving
your girlfriend home
and she's saying
how she never chose you
"turn left", she says
so I turn left
and she says
"So how did I end up
so deeply involved in
the very existence
I planned on avoiding?"
and I can't answer
I'm driving
your girlfriend home
and she's laughing
to stop herself crying
"drive on", she says
so I drive on
and she says
"So how did I end up
attached to this person
when his sense of humour
gets gradually worser?"
and I can't tell her
I'm parking
outside her home
and we're shaking hands
goodnight, so politely

 

THE HARSH TRUTH OF THE CAMERA EYE

Churchillian legs
hair barely there
the harsh truth of the camera eye
Your eyes signal pain
because of the strain
of smiling
the harsh truth of the camera eye
telling you all
that you never wnated to know
showing what
you didn't want shown
My so friendly lens
zooms into
"the inner you"
and it tells the harsh truth
and nothing but
Laugh with us all here
that's if you can
then take the pictures home
and screamtelling you all
that you never wanted to know
showing you what
you didn't want shown
This photographer
he must have really had it in for you
"Oh, I don't want
to be judged anymore
I don't wnat to be judged
I would sooner be Loved
I would sooner be
just blindly Loved..."

 

(I'M) THE END OF THE FAMILY LINE

With no complications
fifteen generations
(of mine)
all honouring Nature
until I arrive
(with incredible style)
I'm the end fo the line
the end of the family line
the end of the line
No baby pulled screaming
out into this seething whirl
by chance or whim
(or even love?)
our family tree hacked into decline
and I'm spared the pain
of ever saying
("goodbye")
I'm the end of the line
the end of the family line
the end of the line

 

THERE'S A PLACE IN HELL FOR ME AND MY FRIENDS

There is a place
reserved
for me and my friends
and when we go
we all will go
so you see
I'm never alone
there is a place
with a bit more time
and a few more
gentler words
and looking back
we do forgive
(we had no choice
we always did)
all that we hope
is that when we go
our skin
and our blood
and our bones
don't get in your way
making you ill
the way they did
when we lived
There is a place
a place in hell

TONY THE PONY

Still drinking on the corner 
Just don't say I didn't warn you 
Always nagging big brother 
He's only looking out for you 
Tony The Pony 
Tony The Pony 
You're still standing on the corner 
Just don't say I didn't warn you 
Old and jealous big brother 
You had your time and you spent it 
Crying 
Now, Tony The Pony 
Tony The Pony 
So, that's what they call you now ? 
When you're free outside 
So cold and hard and in control 
And ... 
There's a free ride on 
Tony The Pony 
Oh, why do you always wanna stop me 
From doing the things in life that make me happy ? 
And when I'm outside with friends, laughing loudly 
Why do you always wanna stop me ? 
Oh, I would never 
I would never 
But you will carry the can for anyone 
The free ride on 
Gullible Tony 
You're drunker quicker 
And you're sicker even quicker 
For something heavy is gonna fall on you 
Oh ... 
And what do they call you now ? 
When you're free outside 
So cold and hard and in control 
And, oh ... been a lark 
There's a free ride on 
Fucked-up Tony 
I will never say I told you so 
Or how I knew that something bad 
Would happen to you 
I don't wanna say I told you so 
Oh, but Tony, I told you so !!! 
I told you so

 

YOU'RE GONNA NEED SOMEONE ON YOUR SIDE

With the world's fate 
Resting on your shoulder 
You're gonna need 
Someone on your side 
You can't do it by yourself 
Any longer 
You're gonna need 
Someone on your side 
Someone kindly told me 
That you'd wasted 
Eight of nine lives
Oh, give yourself a break 
Before you break down 
You're gonna need someone on your side 
And here I am, And here I am 
Well, you don't need 
To look so pleased ! 
Day or night, 
There is no difference 
You're gonna need someone on your side 
Day or night, 
There is no difference 
You're gonna need someone soon 
And here I am, And here I am 
Well, you don't need 
To look so pleased

 

GLAMOROUS GLUE

First day with the jar 
You find 
Everyone lies 
First day with the jar 
You find 
Everyone lies, nobody minds 
Everyone lies 
Where is the man you respect ? 
And where is the woman you love ? 
Where's the woman you love ? 
Third week with the jar
You find 
Everything dies 
We won't vote Conservative 
Because we never have 
Everyone lies, everyone lies 
Where is the man you respect ? 
And where is the woman you love ? 
Where's the woman you love ? 
Everything of worth 
On Earth Is there To share 
I used to dream, and I used to vow 
I wouldn't dream of it now 
We look to Los Angeles 
For the language we use 
London is dead, London is dead, London is dead...
Now I'm too much in love 
I'm too much in love 
I know 
I'll go 
Empty hand 
From the land

 

WE'LL LET YOU KNOW

How sad are we ? 
And how sad have we been ? 
We'll let you know 
We'll let you know 
Oh, but only if - you're really interested 
You wonder how 
We've stayed alive 'till now 
We'll let you know 
We'll let you know 
But only if - you're really interested 
We're all smiles 
Then, honest, I swear, it's the turnstiles 
That make us hostile 
Oh ... 
We will descend 
On anyone unable to defend 
Themselves 
Oh ... 
And the songs we sing 
They're not supposed to mean a thing 
La, la, la, la ... 
Oh ...You're lonely, Oh ... you're lonely, Oh ... 
GET OFF THE ROOF ! Oh ... 
Your Arsenal !
We may seem cold, or 
We may even be 
The most depressing people you've ever known 
At heart, what's left, we sadly know 
That we are the last truly British people you'll ever know 
We are the last truly British people you will ever know 
You'll never never want to know

 

THE NATIONAL FRONT DISCO

David, the wind blows 
The wind blows ... 
Bits of your life away 
Your friends all say ... 
"Where is our boy ? Oh, we've lost our boy" 
But they should know 
Where you've gone 
Because again and again you've explained that 
You're going to ... 
Oh, you're going to ... 
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah 
England for the English ! 
England for the English ! 
David, the winds blow 
The winds blow ...
All of my dreams away 
And I still say : 
"Where is our boy ? Ah, we've lost our boy" 
But I should know 
Why you've gone 
Because again and again you've explained
You've gone to the ... 
National, ah ... 
To the National .. 
There's a country; you don't live there 
But one day you would like to 
And if you show them what you're made of 
Oh, then you might do ... 
But David, we wonder 
We wonder if the thunder 
Is ever really gonna begin 
Begin, begin 
Your mom says : 
"I've lost my boy" 
But she should know 
Why you've gone 
Because again and again you've explained 
You've gone to the : 
National 
To the National 
To the National Front Disco 
Because you want the day to come sooner 
You want the day to come sooner 
You want the day to come sooner 
When you've settled the score

CERTAIN PEOPLE I KNOW

I take the cue from 
Certain people I know 
I use the cue 
And then I 
Hand it on to you 
And when I swing it 
So, it catches his eye ... 
(Weren't you there ? 
- You'd have died !) 
I trust the views of 
Certain people I know 
They look at Danger 
And they 
LAUGH THEIR HEADS OFF 
Their clothes are Imitation 
George the 23rd 
(Don't you find this absurd ?) 
I'd hate to be like 
Certain people I know 
They break their necks 
And can't afford to
Get them fixed 
Ah, they'd sacrifice all 
Of their principles for 
anything cashable 
I do believe it's terrible 
Oh, wo, wo, Ah, ah, ah, ah, Oh, wo, wo...

 

WE HATE IT WHEN OUR FRIENDS BECOME SUCCESSFUL

We hate it when our friends become successful

And such a video ! 
Well, it's really laughable 
Ha, ha, ha ...
We hate it when our friends become successful 
And if they're Northern, that makes it even worse
And if we can destroy them 
You bet your life we will 
Destroy them 
If we can hurt them 
Well, we may as well ... 
It's really laughable 
Ha, ha, ha ... 
You see, it should've been me 
It could've been me 
Everybody knows 
Everybody says so 
They say :

So many songs 
More songs than they'd stand

SEASICK, YET STILL DOCKED

I am a poor freezingly cold soul 
So far from where 
I intended to go 
Scavenging through life's very constant lulls 
So far from where I'm determined to go 
Wish I knew the way to reach the one I love
There is no way ... 
Wish I had the charm to attract the one I love 
But you see, I've got no charm 
Mmm...
Tonight I've consumed much more than I can hold 
Oh, this is very clear to you 
And you can tell I have never really loved 
You can tell, by the way, I sleep all day
And all of my life no-one gave me anything 
No-one has ever given me anything 
My love is as sharp as a needle in your eye 
You must be such a fool 
To pass me by

 

I KNOW IT'S GONNA HAPPEN SOMEDAY

My love, wherever you are 
Whatever you are 
Don't lose faith 
I know it's gonna happen someday 
To you 
Please wait ... Please wait ... Oh ... Wait ... 
Don't lose faith 
You say that the day just never arrives 
And it's never seemed so far away 
Still, I know it's gonna happen someday 
To you 
Please wait ... 
Don't lose faith

Tomorrow 
Does it have to come ?
All I ask of you is one thing that you'll never do 
Would you put your arms around me ?

Tomorrow 
And what must come before ...
Oh, the pain in my arms 
Oh, the pain in my legs 
Ooh, my shiftless body 
Tomorrow 
It's surely nearer now ? 
You don't think I'll make it 
I never said I wanted to ! 
Well did I ? 
Oh, the pain in my arms 
Oh, the pain in my legs 
Oh, yeah; oh, yeah, No, yeah; no, yeah 
Through my shiftless body 
Tomorrow, Tomorrow 
All I ask of you ... oh ... 
Is : would you tell me that you love me 
Tell me, tell me that you love me, Tell me, tell me that you love me ... 
Ah, I know you don't mean it

Tell me, tell me that you love me, Tell me, tell me that you love me ...

NOVEMBER SPAWNED A MONSTER

Sleep on and dream of Love
because it's the closest you will get to love
poor twisted child, so ugly, so ugly
poor twisted child, oh hug me, oh hug me
one November spawned a monster 
in the shape of this child who later cried
"But Jesus made me, so Jesus save me from
pity, sympathy and people discussing me"
a frame of useless limbs what can make GOOD
all the BAD that's been done?
And if the lights were out
could you even bear
to kiss her full on the mouth (or anywhere?)
poor twisted child, so ugly, so ugly
poor twisted child, oh hug me, oh hug me
one November spawned a monster 
in the shape of this child who must remain
a hostage to kindess and the wheels underneath her
a hostage to kindess and the wheels underneath her
a symbol of where mad, mad lovers
must PAUSE and draw the line
So sleep and dream of love
because it's the closest
you will get to love
that November is a time which I must put OUT of my mind
oh one fine day 
LET IT BE SOON
she won't be rich or beautiful
but she'll be walking your streets
in the clothes that she went out
and chose for herself

 

SEASICK, YET STILL DOCKED

I am a poor freezingly cold soul 
So far from where

Scavenging through life's very constant lulls

THE LOOP

I just wanna say 
I haven't been away 
I'm still right here 
Where I always was 
So one day, if you're bored 
By all means call 
Because you can do 
(But only if you want to) 
I just wanna say 
I haven't been away 
I am still right here 
Where I always was 
So one day, when you're bored 
By all means call 
Because you can do 
But you might not get through

 

SISTER I'M A POET

All over this town 
Yes, a low wind may blow 
And I can see through everybo... 
With no reason 
To hide these words I feel 
And no reason 
To talk about the books I read 
But still I do 
That's 'cause I'm a ... Sister I'm a ... 
All over this town 
Along this way 
Outside the prison gates 
I love the romance of crime 
And I wonder 
Does anybody feel the way I do ? 
And is evil just something you are 
Or something you do ? 
Sister I'm a ... Sister I'm a ... 
All over this town, All over this town 
They pull over 
In their Citroen vans 
Not to shake your hand 
With meths on their breaths 
And you with youth on your side 
A plastic bag stranded at the lights 
This once was me ...
But now I'm a ... Sister I'm a ...
All over this town ... Oh, oh, oh 
All over this town, All over this town, Oh ... 
I still cannot speak French ... I am very lazy

 

JACK THE RIPPER

Oh, you look so tired 
Mouth slack and wide 
Ill-housed and ill-advised 
Your face is as mean 
As your life has been 
Crash into my arms 
I WANT YOU 
You don't agree -
But you don't refuse 
I know you 
And I know a place 
Where no one is likely to pass 
Oh, you don't care if it's late 
And you don't care if you're lost 
And oh, you look so tired 
(But tonight you presumed too much) 
Too much, too much 
And if it's the last 
Thing I ever do 
I'M GONNA GET YOU 
Crash into my arms 
I WANT YOU 
You don't agree -
But you don't refuse 
I know you 
And no one knows a thing about my life 
I can come and go as I please 
And if I want to, I can stay 
Oh, or if I want to, I can leave 
Nobody knows me, Nobody knows me, Nobody knows me Oh, oh...

 

SUCH A LITTLE THING MAKES SUCH A BIG DIFFERENCE

Such a little thing, such a little thing
but the difference it made was grave
there you go
wielding a bicycle chain
oh why won't you change
cange and be nicer?
such a little thing
a gentle tone of kindness
or written words on paper
- can you write?
How I love all of
the very simple things of life
(God's good air)
how I love all of
the very simple things of life
such a little thing
a fumbling politeness
the difference it saved me
wielding a bicycle chain
"I WILL NOT CHANGE AND I WILL NOT BE NICE"
Most people keep their brains between your legs (don't you find?)
Leave me alone - I was only singing, leave me alone because
I was only singing
leave me alone - I was only singing, leave me alone
you have just proved (again)
MOST PEOPLE KEEP THEIR BRAINS BETWEEN THEIR LEGS

 

I KNOW IT'S GONNA HAPPEN SOMEDAY

My love, wherever you are 
Whatever you are 
Don't lose faith 
I know it's gonna happen someday 
To you

You say that the day just never arrives 
And it's never seemed so far away 
Still, I know it's gonna happen someday

WE'LL LET YOU KNOW

How sad are we ? 
And how sad have we been ? 
We'll let you know, We'll let you know 
Oh, but only if - you're really interested 
You wonder how 
We've stayed alive 'till now 
We'll let you know, We'll let you know 
But only if - you're really interested 
We're all smiles 
Then, honest, I swear, it's the turnstiles 
That make us hostile 
Oh ... We will descend 
On anyone unable to defend 
Themselves 
Oh ... And the songs we sing 
They're not supposed to mean a thing 
La, la, la, la ... Oh ...
You're lonely, Oh ... you're lonely 
Oh ... 
GET OFF THE ROOF !
Oh ... Your Arsenal !
We may seem cold, or 
We may even be 
The most depressing people you've ever known 
At heart, what's left, we sadly know 
That we are the last truly British people you'll ever know 
We are the last truly British people you will ever know 
You'll never never want to know

 

SUEDHEAD

Why do you come here
why do you hang around
I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry
Why do you come here
when you know it makes
things hard for me
when you know, oh
why do you come?
Why do you telephone?
and why send me silly notes?
I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry
why do you come here
when you know it makes
thing hard for me
when you know, oh
why do you come?
You had to sneak into my room
'just' to read my diary
was it just to see all the things
you knew I'd written about you?
and...so many illustrations
I'm so very sickened
oh, I am so sickened NOW

 

HE KNOWS I'D LOVE TO SEE HIM

He Knows (he knows)
Or, I think he does
because when I lived
in the Arse of the world...
he knows, he knows, he knows I'd love
to see him happy (or as close as is allowed)
because when I lived
in the Arse of the world
he knows, he knows, he knows I'd love
to see him happy (or as close as possible
as close as possible, as close as is allowed)
My name still conjours up deadly deeds
and a bad taste in the mouth
the police - they actually knew me
they said:
"You're just another person in the world
you're just another fool with radical views
you're just another who has maddening views
you want to turn it on its head
by staying in bed!"
I said: "I know I do"

 

YOU'RE GONNA NEED SOMEONE ON YOUR SIDE

With the world's fate 
Resting on your shoulder

Someone kindly told me 
That you'd wasted 
Eight of nine lives
Oh, give yourself a break 
Before you break down 
You're gonna need someone on your side 
And here I am, And here I am 
Well, you don't need 
To look so pleased ! 
Day or night, 
There is no difference 
You're gonna need someone on your side 
Day or night, 
There is no difference 
You're gonna need someone soon 
And here I am, And here I am 
Well, you don't need 
To look so pleased

NOW MY HEART IS FULL

There's gonna be some trouble 
A whole house will need re-building 
And everyone I love in the house 
Will recline on an analyst's couch quite 
Soon 
Your Father cracks a joke 
And in the usual way 
Empties the room 
Tell all of my friends 
(I don't have too many 
Just some rain-coated lovers' puny brothers)
Dallow, Spicer, Pinkie, Cubitt 
Rush to danger 
Wind up nowhere 
Patric Doonan - raised to wait 
I'm tired again, I've tried again, and 
Now my heart is full 
Now my heart is full 
And I just can't explain 
So I won't even try to
Dallow, Spicer, Pinkie, Cubitt 
Every jammy Stressford poet 
Loafing oafs in all-night chemists 
Loafing oafs in all-night chemists 
Underact - express depression 
Ah, but Bunnie I loved you 
I was tired again 
I've tried again, and 
Now my heart is full 
Now my heart is full 
And I just can't explain 
So I won't even try to 
Could you pass by ? 
Could you pass by ? 
Oh ... 
Now my heart is full 
Now my heart is full 
And I just can't explain 
So ... slow ... 
Slow ... slow ... slow ... slow ... slow ...

 

SPRING-HEELED JIM

Spring-heeled Jim winks an eye 
He'll "do", he'll never be "done to" 
He takes on whoever flew through 
"Well, it's the normal thing to do" ... ah ... 
Spring-heeled Jim lives to love 
Now kissing with his mouth full 
And his eyes on some other fool 
So many women 
His head should be spinning 
Ah, but no ! 
Ah, but no ! 
But no !
Ah, no !
Spring-heeled Jim slurs the words : 
"There's no need to be so knowing
Take life at five times the 
Average speed, like I do" 
Until Jim feels the chill 
"Oh, where did all the time go ?" 
Once always in for the kill 
Now it's too cold 
And he feels too 
old 
Too old
Mmm, old... 
La, la, la, la-la, la ...

So you think that you should ? 
Everyone's laughing ! 
Since I took up with you 
Things have been bad 
Yeah, but now it's 12 years on 
Now it's 12 years on 
Yes, and I took up with you 
I took my job application 
Into town 
Did you hear ? They turned me down 
Yes, and it's all because of us 
Oh, and what was in our eyes 
Oh, what was in our eyes, yeah 
I said, Billy Budd 
I would happily lose 
Both of my legs 
I would lose both of my legs 
Oh, if it meant you could be free 
Oh, if it meant you could be free 
(Don't leave us in the dark!)

 

HOLD ON TO YOUR FRIENDS

A bond of trust 
Has been abused 
Something of value 
May be lost 
Give up your job 
Squander your cash - be rash 
Just hold on to your friends 
There are more than enough 
To fight and oppose 
Why waste good time 
Fighting the people you like 
Who will fall defending your name 
Oh, don't feel so ashamed 
To have friends 
But now you only call me 
When you're feeling depressed 
When you feel happy I'm 
So far from your mind 
My patience is stretched 
My loyalty vexed 
Oh, you're losing all of your friends 
Hold on to your friends 
Hold on to your friends 
Resist - or move on 
Be mad, be rash 
Smoke and explode 
Sell all of your clothes 
Just bear in mind : 
Oh, there just might come a time 
When you need some friends

 

THE MORE YOU IGNORE ME, THE CLOSER I GET

The more you ignore me 
The closer I get 
You're wasting your time 
The more you ignore me 
The closer I get 
You're wasting your time 
I will be 
In the bar 
With my head 
On the bar 
I am now 
A central part 
Of your mind's landscape 
Whether you care 
Or do not 
Yeah, I've made up your mind 
The more you ignore me 
The closer I get 
You're wasting your time 
The more you ignore me 
The closer I get 
You're wasting your time 
Beware !
I bear more grudges 
Than lonely high court judges 
When you sleep 
I will creep 
Into your thoughts 
Like a bad debt 
That you can't pay 
Take the easy way 
And give in 
Yeah, and let me in 
Oh, let me in 
Oh let me ... 
Oh, let me in 
IT'S WAR 
IT'S WAR 
WAR 
WAR 
Oh, let me in 
Ah, the closer I get 
Ah, you're asking for it 
Ah, the closer I get 
Ooh, the closer I ...

 

WHY DON'T YOU FIND OUT FOR YOURSELF

The sanest days are mad 
Why don't you find out for yourself ? 
Then you'll see the price 
Very closely 
Some men here 
They have a special interest 
In your career 
They wanna help you to grow 
And then syphon all your dough 
Why don't you find out for yourself ? 
Then you'll see the glass 
Hidden in the grass 
You'll never believe me, so 
Why don't you find out for yourself ? 
Sick down to my heart 
That's just the way it goes 
Some men here 
They know the full extent of 
Your distress 
They kneel and pray 
And they say : 
"Long may it last" 
Why don't you find out for yourself ?
Then you'll see the glass 
Hidden in the grass 
Bad scenes come and go 
For which you must allow 
Sick down to my heart 
That's just the way it goes 
Don't rake up my mistakes 
I know exactly what they are 
And ... what do YOU do ? 
Well ... you just SIT THERE 
I've been stabbed in the back 
So many many times 
I don't have any skin 
But that's just the way it goes

 

I AM HATED FOR LOVING

I am hated for loving 
I am hated for loving 
Anonymous call, a poison pen 
A brick in the small of the back again 
I still don't belong 
To anyone - I am mine 
And I am hated for loving 
I am haunted for wanting 
Anonymous call, a poison pen 
A brick in the ... ah ... 
A brick in the small of the back again 
I still don't belong 
To anyone - I am mine 
I am falling 
With no-one to catch me 
I am falling 
And there's still 
No-one to catch me 
Ah .. 
Anonymous call, a poison pen 
A brick in the ... ah ... 
A brick in the small of the back again 
I just don't belong 
To anywhere 
I just don't belong 
Mmm ... 
Ah ...

 

LIFEGUARD SLEEPING, GIRL DROWNING

Always looking for attention 
Always needs to be mentioned 
Who does she 
Think she should be ? 
The shrill cry through darkening air 
Doesn't she know he's 
Had such a busy day ? 
Tell her ... sshhh
Somebody tell her ... sshhh 
Slowest ... 
It was only a test 
But she swam too far 
Against the tide 
She deserves all she gets 
The sky became marked with stars 
As an out-stretched arm slowly 
Disappears 
Hooray 
Oh hooray 
No, oh, oh, woh, there's no movement 
No, oh, hooray 
Oh, hooray 
Please don't worry 
There'll be no fuss 
She was ... nobody's nothing 
(What's your name ?) 
When he awoke 
The sea was calm 
And another day passes like a dream 
There's no ... no way 
(What's your name ?)

 

USED TO BE A SWEET BOY

Used to be a sweet boy 
Holding so tightly 
To Daddy's hand 
But that was all 
In some distant land 
Blazer and tie 
And a big bright healthy smile 
Used to make all 
Of our trials worthwhile 
Used to be a sweet boy 
And I'm not to blame 
Something went wrong 
And I know 
I'm not to blame 
Something went wrong 
Can't be to blame 
Ah ...

 

THE LAZY SUNBATHERS

A world war 
Was announced 
Days ago 
But they didn't know 
The lazy sunbathers 
The lazy sunbathers 
The sun burns through 
To the planet's core 
And it isn't enough 
They want more 
Nothing 
Appears 
To be 
Between the ears of 
The lazy sunbathers 
Too jaded 
To question stagnation 
The sun burns through 
To the planet's core 
And it isn't enough 
They want more 
Religions fall 
Children shelled 
"...Children shelled ? That's all 
Very well, but would you 
Please keep the noise 
Down low ? 
Because you're waking 
The lazy sunbathers ..."
Oh, the lazy sunbathers 
The lazy sunbathers

 

SPEEDWAY

And when you slam 
Down the hammer 
Can you see it in your heart ? 
All of the rumours 
Keeping me grounded 
I never said, I never said that they were 
Completely unfounded 
So when you slam 
Down the hammer 
Can you see it in your heart ? 
Can you delve so low ? 
And when you're standing 
On my fingers 
Can you see it in your heart ? ... ah ... 
And when you try 
To break my spirit 
It won't work 
Because there's nothing left to break 
Anymore 
All of the rumours 
Keeping me grounded 
I never said, I never said that they were 
Completely unfounded 
You won't sleep 
Until the earth that wants me 
Finally has me 
Oh you've done it now 
You won't rest 
Until the hearse that becomes me 
Finally takes me 
Oh you've done it now 
And you won't smile 
Until my loving mouth 
Is shut good and proper 
FOREVER 
All of the rumours 
Keeping me grounded 
I never said, I never said that they were 
Completely unfounded 
And all those lies 
Written lies, twisted lies 
Well, they weren't lies 
They weren't lies 
They weren't lies 
I never said 
I never said 
I could have mentioned your name 
I could have dragged you in 
Guilt by implication 
By association 
I've always been true to you 
In my own strange way 
I've always been true to you 
In my own sick way 
I'll always stay true to you

 

THE TEACHERS ARE AFRAID OF THE PUPILS

There's too many people 
Planning your downfall 
When your spirit's on trial 
These nights can be frightening 
Sleep transports sadness 
To some other mid-brain 
And somebody here 
Will not be here next year 
So you stand by the board 
Full of fear and intention 
And, if you think that they're listening 
Well, you've got to be joking 
Oh, you understand change 
And you think it's essential 
But when your profession 
Is humiliation 
Say the wrong word to our children ...
We'll have you, oh yes, we'll have you 
Lay a hand on our children 
And it's never too late to have you 
Mucus on your collar 
A nail up through the staff chair 
A blade in your soap 
And you cry into your pillow 
To be finished would be a relief 
To be finished would be a relief... 
Say the wrong word to our children ...
We'll have you, oh yes, we'll have you 
Lay a hand on our children 
And it's never too late to have you 
To be finished would be a relief 
To be finished would be a relief...
I'm very glad this thing has come 
Sometimes I'm so glad 
Never bother to play the tunes 
I've seen it coming for dear life

 

READER MEET AUTHOR

You don't know a thing about their lives 
They live where you wouldn't dare to drive
You shake as you think of how they sleep 
But you write as if you are my side-by-side 
Reader, meet Author 
With the hope of hearing sense 
But you may be feeling let down 
By the words of defence 
He says : "No-one ever sees me when I cry"
You don't know a thing about their lives 
Books don't save them, books aren't Stanley knives 
And if a fight broke out here tonight 
You'd be the first away, because you're that type 
And the Year 2000 won't change anyone here 
As each fabled promise flies so fast 
You'll swear it was never there 
Oh, have you ever escaped from a shipwrecked life ? 
So safely with your software; all miles from the front line 
You hear the way their sad voices, and you start to imagine things 
Oh, any excuse to write more lies

He's just too good-natured and

THE OPERATION

You fight with your right hand 
And caress with your left hand 
Everyone I know is sick to death of you 
With a tear that's a mile wide 
In the kite that you're flying 
Everyone I know is sick to death of you 
Ever since 
You don't look the same 
You're just not the same, no way 
You say clever things and 
You never used to 
You don't catch what I'm saying 
When you're deafened to advice 
Everyone here is sick to the 
Back teeth of you 
With a tear that's a mile wide 
In the kite that you're flying 
Everyone here is sick to the 
Tattoo of you 
Ever since 
You don't look the same 
You're just not the same, no way 
You say pleasant things and 
There is no need to
Still, you fight with your right hand 
And caress with your left hand 
Ooh, ooh ... Sad to say ... 
How once I was in love with you 
Sad to say ... 
You don't catch what I'm saying 
When you're deafened to advice 
Ooh, ooh ... Ever since 
You don't look the same 
You're just not the same, no way 
What the hell have 
They stuck into you ?

 

DAGENHAM DAVE

Head in the clouds, and a mouthful of pie 
Head in a blouse, everybody loves him 
I see why 
Dagenham Dave, Dagenham Dave, Oh, Dagenham Dave 
Dagenham Dave, Dagenham Dave, Oh, Dagenham Dave 
"I love Karen, I love Sharon" on the windowscreen 
With never the need to fight or to question a single thing 
Dagenham Dave, Dagenham Dave Oh, Dagenham Dave 
Dagenham Dave, Dagenham Dave Oh, Dagenham Dave ...
He'd love to touch, he's afraid that he might self-combust 
I could say more, but you get the general idea 
Dagenham Dave, Dagenham Dave Dagenham Dave, Dagenham Dave 
Dagenham, Dagenham Dagenham Dave, Dagenham Dave ...
Oh, Dave, oh, Dagenham, dagenham, Oh, Dave, oh, Dave, ...

 

DO YOUR BEST AND DON'T WORRY

Compare the best of their days 
With the worst of your days 
You won't win 
With your standards so high 
And your spirits so low 
At least remember ... 
This is you on a bad day, you on a pale day 
Just do your best and don't ... Don't worry, oh 
The way you hang yourself is oh, so unfair 
See the best of how they look 
Against the worst of how you are
And again, you won't win 
With your standards so high 
And your spirits so low 
At least remember ... 
This is you on a drab day, you in a drab dress 
Just do your best and don't ... Don't worry, oh 
The way you hang yourself is oh, so unfair 
Just do your best and don't ... Don't worry, oh 
The way you watch yourself is oh, so unfair 
Just do your best and don't ... Don't worry, oh 
Do your best and don't ...

SOUTHPAW

You were a boy before you became a man 
I don't see the joy 
And you ran with your pals in the sun 
You turned around and they were gone 
Again ... 
A sick boy should be treated 
So easily defeated 
Oh, I just don't understand 
So you ran with your pals in the sun 
You turned around 
You were alone 
Again ... 
And you ran back to Ma 
Which set the pace for the rest of your days 
Oh, you ran back to Ma 
Which set the pace for the rest of your days 
Oh, you ran back to Ma 
Which set the pace for the rest of your days 
And now, there is something that you should know 
There is something that you should know 
The girl of your dreams is 
Here all alone 
Girl of your dreams is 
Here all alone 
The girl of your dreams is 
Sad and all alone 
The girl of your dreams is 
Here all alone 
There is something that you should know

Sad and is all alone 
The girl of your dreams is 
Sad and is feeling all alone 
Oh, there is something that you should know 
Help me, help me, help me ...

 

MALADJUSTED

I wanna start from 
Before the beginning 
Loot wine, "Be mine, and 
Then let's stay out for the night"
Ride via Parkside 
Semi-perilous lives 
Jeer the lights in the windows 
Of all safe and stable homes 
(But wondering then, well what 
Could peace of mind be like ?)
Anyway do you want to hear 
Our story, or not ? 
As the Fulham Road lights 
Stretch and invite into the night 
From a Stevenage overspill 
We'd kill to live around 
SW6 - with someone like you 
Keep thieves' hours 
With someone like you 
...As long as it slides 
You stalk the house 
In a low-cut blouse : 
"Oh Christ, another stifled 
Friday night !"
And the Fulham Road lights 
Stretch and invite into the night 
Well, I was fifteen 
What could I know ?
When the gulf between 
All the things I need 
And the things I receive 
Is an ancient ocean 
Wide, wild, lost, uncrossed 
Still I maintain there's nothing 
Wrong with you 
You do all that you do 
Because it's all you can do 
Well, I was fifteen 
Where could I go ?
With a soul full of loathing 
For stinging bureaucracy 
Making it anything 
Other than easy 
For working girls like me 
With my hands on my head 
I flop on your bed 
With a head full of dread 
For all I've ever said 
Maladjusted, maladjusted 
Maladjusted maladjusted 
Never to be trusted 
Oh, never to be trusted 
There's nothing wrong with you, oh 
...There's nothing wrong with you

 

ALMA MATTERS

So : the choice I have made 
May seem strange to you 
But who asked you, anyway ? 
It's my life to wreck 
My own way 
You see : to someone, somewhere, oh yeah ... 
Alma matters 
In mind, body and soul 
In part, and in whole 
Because to someone, somewhere, oh yeah ... 
Alma matters 
In mind, body and soul 
In part, and in whole 
So the life I have made 
May seem wrong to you 
But, I've never been surer 
It's my life to ruin 
My own way 
You see : to someone, somewhere, oh yeah ... 
Alma matters 
In mind, body and soul 
In part, and in whole 
Because to someone, somewhere, oh yeah ... 
Alma matters 
In mind, body and soul 
In part, and in whole 
To someone, somewhere, oh yeah ... 
Alma matters 
In mind, body and soul 
Part, and in whole 
So to someone, somewhere, oh yeah ...

To someone, somewhere, oh yeah ... 
Oh yeah ... Oh yeah, oh yeah Oh yeah ...

 

AMBITIOUS OUTSIDERS

Bolt-lock your doors 
Alarm your cars 
And still we move in closer 
Every day 
Top of the list 
Is your smiling kids 
But we'll be smiling too 
So that's OK 
Oh, and by the way 
Thank you, because you're 
Giving, giving, giving 
And we're receiving - 
No, no, we're taking 
Keeping the population down 
Your taxes paid, but 
Police waylaid 
And we knows 
When the school bus 
Comes and goes 
We're on your street, but 
You don't see us 
Or, if you do 
You smile and say Hello 
BUT DON'T UNDERESTIMATE US 
When you are 
Giving, giving, giving 
And we're receiving - 
No, no, we're taking 
Just keeping 
The population down 
You're giving, giving, giving 
Well, it's your own fault 
For reproducing 
We're just keeping 
The population down

 

TROUBLE LOVES ME

Trouble loves me 
Trouble needs me 
Two things 
More than you do 
Or would attempt to 
So, console me 
Otherwise, hold me 
Just when it seems like 
Everything's evened out 
And the balance 
Seems serene 
Trouble loves me 
Walks beside me 
To chide me 
Not to guide me 
It's still much more 
Than you'll do 
So, console me 
Otherwise, hold me 
Just when it seems like 
Everything's evened out 
And the balance seems serene 
See the fool I'll be 
Still running 'round 
On the flesh rampage 
Still running 'round 
Ready with ready-wit 
Still running 'round 
On the flesh rampage 
- At your age ! 
Go to Soho, oh 
Go to waste in 
The wrong arms 
Still running 'round 
Trouble loves me 
Seeks and finds me 
To charlatanize me 
Which is only 
As it should be 
Oh, please fulfill me 
Otherwise, kill me 
Show me a barrel and watch me scrape it 
Faced with the music, as always I'll face it 
In the half-light 
So English, frowning 
Then at midnight I 
Can't get you out of my head 
A disenchanted taste 
Still running 'round 
A disenchanted taste 
Still running 'round

 

PAPA JACK

Papa Jack 
Wants to turn 
Back the clock 
And reach out 
To the kids 
He once had 
Who have flown 
Papa Jack 
In decline 
Feels inclined 
To reach out 
To the kids 
He once had 
Who have flown 
But there was a time 
When the kids reached up 
And Papa Jack just 
Pushed them away 
Looking deep 
In his heart 
Papa Jack 
Doesn't like 
What he sees 
Or the time 
On his hands 
The dying day 
The chilly sun 
Papa Jack 
All alone 
Sings slow 
Grieving and low 
But there was a time 
When the kids reached up 
Now you can't always 
Have it your way 
Papa Jack 
Ah ...

 

AMMUNITION

I know these roads 
Each ridge 
And narrow bridge 
Each cheveron 
Enticing me on 
Each warning sign 
I take in my stride 
I don't need more ammunition 
I've got more than I can spend 
I don't dwell on things I'm missing 
I'm just pleased 
With the things I've found 
I know these roads 
An old hand understands 
Above all, I know what's 
Expected of me now 
Veering cliffwards 
I don't need more ammunition 
I've got more than I can spend 
I don't dwell on things I'm missing 
I'm just pleased 
With the things I've found 
With the things I've found 
With the things I've found 
I've found 
I've been crying 
It comes back on these salient days 
And it stays 
And it says : 
"We've never really been away" 
I don't need more ammunition 
I've got more than I can spend 
I don't think of who I'm missing 
I've got no space and no time 
In my life, anymore 
No space or time 
In my life, anymore 
For Revenge

 

WIDE TO RECEIVE

Download something 
Useful, or useless 
Because I'm lying here 
Wide to receive 
Almost anything 
You'd care to give 
And I don't 
Get along with myself 
And I'm not too keen 
On anyone else 
Turn on, plug in 
Then just walk away 
Unlock, process 
And then just go 
And I've never felt quite so alone 
As I do right now 
I'm lying here 
Wide to receive 
Almost anything 
You'd care to leave 
Wide, wide, wide Wide, wide, wide...

 

ROY'S KEEN

(GO ON !)
He's romancing you 
And chancing his arm 
He'll be here 
Smiling on time 
He's romancing you 
And chancing his arm 
He'll be here 
Smiling on time 
Roy's keen oh Roy's keen 
Roy's keen oh Roy's keen 
We've never seen a 
Keener window-cleaner 
Back up the ladder 
Into each corner 
Dunking the chamois 
Just think of the goodwill 
The ladder's a planet 
Roy is a star, and 
I am a satellite 
(But that's alright) 
He can hold a smile for as long 
As you require (even longer) 
He can hold a smile for as long 
As you require (even longer) 
Roy's keen oh Roy's keen 
Roy's keen oh Roy's keen 
We've never seen a 
Keener window-cleaner 
Back up the ladder 
Into each corner 
Dunking the chamois 
Just think of the goodwill 
The ladder's a planet 
Roy is a star, and 
I am a satellite 
I will be set alight 
Don't say you'll hold it steady 
Then you let it go 
Don't say you'll hold it steady 
Then you let it go Oh ...
You're up the ladder 
Into each corner 
Foot in a bucket 
We trust you to wreck it 
Even when it's under your nose 
Well, you just can't 
See it, can you ? 
Well, it's here 
Right under your nose 
And you just can't 
See it, can you? La la la la ...
Roy's keen, Roy's keen La la la la ...
We've never seen a 
Keener window-cleaner 
Oh ... La la la la ...

 

HE CRIED

I need you 
Simple words 
But words which had never been heard 
By the soul 
Stoned to death 
But still living 
And so he froze where he stood 
And he looked to the ground 
And he cried 
He cried 
Ride our minds 
If you must 
But there's always a line you don't cross 
Time is short 
Don't be cruel 
Oh you don't know the power 
In what you're saying 
Oh ... 
And so he froze where he stood 
And he looked to the ground 
And he cried 
He cried 
People where 
I come from 
They survive without feelings or blood 
I never could 
Was stoned to death 
But I'm still living 
So he froze where he stood 
And he looked to the ground 
And he cried 
He cried 
So he froze 
And he looked, and he looked 
To the ground 
And he cried 
He cried

 

SORROW WILL COME IN THE END

Legalized theft 
Leaves me bereft 
I get it straight in the neck 
(Somehow expecting no less) 
A court of justice 
With no use for Truth 
Lawyer ...liar 
Lawyer ...liar 
You pleaded and squealed 
And you think you've won 
But Sorrow will come 
To you in the end 
And as sure as my words are pure 
I praise the day that brings you pain 
Q.C.'s obsessed with sleaze 
Frantic for Fame 
They're all on the game 
They just use a different name 
You lied 
And you were believed 
By a J.P. senile and vile 
You pleaded and squealed 
And you think you've won 
But Sorrow will come 
To you in the end 
And as sure as my words are pure 
I praise the day that brings you pain 
So don't close your eyes 
Don't close your eyes 
A man who slits throats 
Has time on his hands 
And I'm gonna get you 
So don't close your eyes 
Don't ever close your eyes 
You think you've won 
OH NO

 

SATAN REJECTED MY SOUL

Satan rejected my soul 
He knows my kind 
He won't be dragged down 
He's seen my face around 
He knows Heaven doesn't seem 
To be my home 
So I must find 
Somewhere else to go 
So I must find 
Somewhere else to go 
So, take it - please 
It's free 
You'll never see 
You'll never see 
All the fun in life it's cost me 
Satan rejected my soul 
As low as he goes 
He never quite goes this low 
He's seen my face around 
He knows Heaven doesn't seem 
To be my home 
So I must find 
Somewhere else to go 
So I must find 
Somewhere else to go 
So, take it please 
It's really sly 
Come on, come on, ah Come on, come on, come on 
Take it please, It's really sly 
Come on, come on, ah Come on, come on, come on 
Call me in, Pull me in, call me in 
Come on, come on, oh Come on, come on, come on 
Pull me in, pull me in, Call me in, haul me in, pull me in 
Come on, come on, ah, Come on, come on 
La la la la la, Oh ...

 
 REEL AROUND THE FOUNTAIN

It's time the tale was told
of how you took a child
and you made him old
Reel around the fountain
slap me on the patio
I'll take it now
Fifteen minutes with you
well, I wouldn't say no
people said that you were virtually dead
and they were so wrong
fifteen minutes with you
well, i wouldn't say no
people said that you were easily led
and they were half-right
I dreamt about you last night
and i fell out of bed twice
you can pin and mount me like a butterfly
but take me to the haven of your bed
was something that you never said
two lumps, please
you're the bee's knees
but so am I
Meet me at the fountain
shove me on the patio
I'll take it slowly
Fifteen minutes with you
oh I wouldn't say no
people see no worth in you
oh but I do

 

YOU'VE GOT EVERYTHING NOW

As merry as the days were long
I was right and you were wrong
back at the old grey school
I would win and you would lose
But you've got everything now
and what a terrible mess I've made of my life
No, I've never had a job
because I've never wanted one
I've seen you smile
but I've never really heard you laugh
So who is rich and who is poor?
I cannot say...
You are your mother's only son
and you're a desperate one
But I don't want a lover
I just want to be seen in the back of your car
A friendship sadly lost?
Well, this is true ...and yet, it's false
Did I ever tell you , by the way
I never did like your face
But you've got everything now
and what a terrible mess I've made of my life
No, I've never had a job
because I'm too shy
But I don't want a lover
I just want to be tied to the back of your car.

 

MISERABLE LIE

So, goodbye
please stay with your own kind
and I'll stay with mine
There's something against us
it's not time
So, goodbye
I know I hardly say
how much I love your casual way
but please put your tongue away
a little higher and we're well away
the dark nights are drawing in
and your humour is as black as them
I look at yours, you laugh at mine
and"love" is just a miserable lie
you have destroyed my flower like-life
not once-but twice
you have corrupt my innocent mind
not once-but twice
I know that wind-swept mystical air
it means: I'd like to see your underwear
I recognise that mystical air
it means: I'd like to see your underwear
what do we get for the trouble and pain?
just a rented room in Whalley Range
into the depths of the criminal world
I followed her...
I need advice, I need advice
because nobody ever looks at me twice
I'm just a country-mile behind
the world
I'm just a country mile behind
the whole world
so take me when you go

 

PRETTY GIRLS MAKE GRAVES

Upon the sand,upon the bay
"there is a quick and easy way" you say
before you illustrate
I'd rather state:
"I'm not the man you think I am
I'm not the man you think I am "
And Sorrow's native son
he will not smile for anyone
And pretty girls makes the graves
End of the pier, end of the bay
you tug my arm and say:"Give into lust,
give up to lust, oh heaven knows we'll
soon be dust..."
But I'm not the man you think I am
I'm not the man you think I am
And Sorrow's native son
he will not rise for anyone
And pretty girls make graves
I could have been wild and I could have been free
but Nature played this trick on me
She wants it Now
and she will not wait
but she's too rough
and I'm too delicate
Then on the sand
another man, he takes her hand
and a smile lights up her stupid face
(and well, it would)
I lost my faith in Womanhood
I lost my faith in Womanhood, I lost my faith

 

THE HAND THAT ROCKS THE CRADLE

Please don't cry
the ghost and the storm outside
will not invade this sacred shire
nor infiltrate your mind
my life down I shall lie
if the bogey-man should try
to play tricks on your sacred mind
to tease, torment and tantalise
wavering shadows loom
a piano plays in an empty room
there'll be blood on the cleaver tonight
when darkness lifts and the room is bright
I'll still be by your side
for you are all that matters
and I'll love you till the day I die
there never need to be longing in your eyes
as long as the hand that rocks the cradle is mine
ceiling shadows shimmy by
and when the wardrobe towers like a beast of prey
there's a sadness in your beautiful eyes
you're untouched, unsoiled, wonderous eyes
my life down I shall lie
should restless spirts try
to play tricks on you sacred mind
but whom I never gave a name
I just looked into his wonderous eyes
and said" never never never again"
all too soon I did return
just like a moth to a flame
so rattle my bones all over the stones
because I'm only a beggar-man whom nobody owns
see how words as old as sin
fit me like a glove I'm here and here I'll stay
together we lie, together we pray
there never need be longing in your eyes
as long as the hand that rocks the cradle is mine

 

STILL ILL

I decree today that life
is simply taking and not giving
England is mine and it owes me a living
ask me why, and I'll spit in your eye
ask me why, and I'll spit in your eye
but we cannot cling to the old dreams anymore
no, we cannot cling to the old dreams anymore
Does the body rule the mind
or does the mind rule the body?
I dunno...
Under the iron bridge we kissed
and although I ended up with sore lips
it just wasn't like the old days anymore
no, it wasn't like those days
am I still ill?
Does the body rule the mind
or does the mind rule the body ?
I dunno...
Ask me why, and I'll die
ask me why, and I'll die
and if you must go to work tomorrow
well, if I were you I wouldn't bother
for there are brighter sides to life
and I should know because I've seen them
but not very often...
under the iron bridge we kissed
and although I ended up with sore lips
it just wasn't like the old days anymore
no, it wasn't like those days
am I still ill?

 

HAND IN GLOVE

Hand in glove
the sun shines out of our behinds
no, it's not like any other love
this one is different-because it's us
Hand in glove
we can go wherever we please
and everything depends upon
how near you stand to me
And if the people stare
then the people stare
I really don't know and I really don't care
Hand in glove
the Good People laugh
yes, we may be hidden by rags
but we have something they'll never have
So, hand in glove I stake my claim
I'll fight to the last breath
If they dare touch a hair on your head
I'll fight to the last breath
The Good Life is out there, somewhere
so stay on my arm, you little charmer
But I know my luck too well
and I'll probably never see you again.

 

WHAT DIFFERENCE DOES IT MAKE?

All men have secrets and here is mine
so let it be known
we have been through hell and high tide,
I can surely rely on you?
and yet you start to recoil,
heavy words are so lightly thrown
but still I'd leap in front of a flying bullet for you
So, what difference does it make?
so, what difference does it make?
it makes none
but you have gone
and you must be looking very old tonight
The devil will find work for idle hands to do
I stole and I lied, and why?
because you asked me to!
but now you make feel so ashamed
because I've only got two hands
well, I'm still fond of you
So, what difference does it make?
so, what difference does it make?
it makes none
but you have gone
and your prejudice won't keep you warm tonight
So, no more apologies
no more apologies
I'm too tired
I'm too sick and tired
and I'm feeling very sick and ill today
But I'm still fond of you

 

I DON'T OWE YOU ANYTHING

Bought on stolen wine
a nod was the first step
you know very well
what was coming next
did I really walk all this way
just to hear you say
"oh I don't want to go out tonight"
but you will
for you must
I don't owe you anything
but you owe me something
repay me now
you should never go to them
let them come to you
just like I do
you should not go to them
let them come to you
just like I do
Too freely on your lips
words prematurely said
oh but I know what will make you smile tonight
Life is never kind
life is never kind
oh but I know what will make you smile tonight

 

SUFFER LITTLE CHILDREN

Over the moors,take me to the moors
dig a shallow grave
and I'll lay me down
Lesley-Anne, with your pretty white beads
oh John, you'll never be a man
and you'll never see your home again
oh Manchester, so much to answer for
Edward, see those alluring lights?
tonight will be your very last night
a woman said "I know my son is dead
I'll never rest my hands on his scared head"
Hindley wakes and Hindley says:
"Wherever he has gone, I have gone "
But fresh lilaced moorland fields
cannot hide the stoild stench of death
Hindley wakes and Hindley says:
"Whatever he has done, I have done"
But this is no easy ride
for a child cries
"find me...find me, nothing more
we're on a sullen misty moor
we may be dead and we may be gone
but we will be right by your side
until the day you die
this is no easy ride
we will haunt you when you laugh
yes, you could say we're a team
you might sleep
BUT YOU WILL NEVER DREAM!"
Oh Manchester, so much to answer for
Oh Manchester, so much to answer for
Over the moor, I'm on the moor
the child is on the moor

 

THE HEADMASTER RITUAL

Belligerent ghouls
run Manchester schools
spineless swines
cemented mines
Sir leads the troops
jealous of youth
same old suit since 1962
he does the military two-step
down the nape of my neck
I wanna go home
I don't want to stay
give up education
is a bad mistake
mid-week on the playing fields
Sir thwacks you on the knees
knees you in the groin
elbow in the face
I wanna go home
I don't want to stay
Belligerent ghouls
run Manchester schools
spineless bastards all
Sir leads the troops
jealous of youth
same old jokes since 1902
he does the military two-step
down the nape of my neck
I wanna go home
I don't want to stay
give up life
as a bad mistake
please excuse me from gym
I've got this terrible cold coming on
he grabs and devours
he kicks me in the showers
kicks me in the showers
and he grabs and devours
I wanna go home
I don't want to stay

 

RUSHOLME RUFFIANS

The last night at the fair
by the big wheel generator
a boy is stabbed
and his money is grabbed
and the air hangs heavy like a dulling wine
she is famous
she is funny
an engagement ring
doesn't mean a thing
to a mind consumed by brass(money)
and though I walk home alone
my faith in love is still devout
the last night at the fair
from a seat on a whirling waltzer
her skirt ascends for a watching eye
it's a hideous trait( on her mother's side)
and though I walk home alone
my faith in love is still devout
then someone falls in love
and someone's beaten up
and the senses being dulled are mine
and someone falls in love
someone's beaten up
and the senses being dulled are mine
and though I walk home alone
my faith in love is still devout
this is the last night of the fair
and the grease in the hair
of a speedway operator
is all a tremulous heart requires
a schoolgirl is denied
she said "How quickly would I die
if I jumped from the top of the parachutes?"
this is the last night of the fair
and the grease in the hair
of a speedway operator

scratch my name on your arm with a fountain pen
(this means you really love me)

I WANT THE ONE I CAN'T HAVE

On the day that your mentality
catches up with your biology
I want the one I can't have
and it's driving me mad
it's written all over my face
A double-bed
and a stalwart lover, for sure
these are the riches of the poor
A double-bed
and a stalwart lover, for sure
these are the riches of the poor
a tough kid who sometimes swallows nails
raised on Prisoner's Aid
he killed a policeman when he was thirteen
and somehow that really impressed me
it's written all over my face
On the day that your mentality
catches up with your biology
And if you ever need self-validation
just meet me in the alley by the
railway-station
it's written all over my face

 

WHAT SHE SAID

What she said:
"How come someone hasn't noticed
that I'm dead
and decided to bury me
God knows, I'm ready"
What she said was
but then, all the rejection she's had
to pretend to be happy
could only be idiocy
What she said was not for the job or
lover that she never had
What she read
all heady books
she'd sit and prophesise
(it took a tattoed boy from Birkenhead
to really really open her eyes)

THAT JOKE ISN'T FUNNY ANYMORE

Park the car at the side of the road
you should know
time's tide will smother you
and I will too
when you laugh about other people who feel so
very lonely
their only desire is to die
well I'm afraid
it doesn't make me smile
I wish I could laugh
but that joke isn't funny anymore
it's too close to home and it's too near the bone
it's too close to home and it's too near the bone
more than you'll ever know
It was dark as I drove the point home
and on cold leather seats
well, it suddenly struck me
I just might die with a smile on my
face after all
I've seen this happen in other people's lives
and now it's happening in mine

 

NOWHERE FAST

I'd like to drop my trousers to the world
I am a man of means(of slender means)
each household appliance
is like a new science in my town
and if a day came when I felt a natural emotion
I'd get such a shock I'd probably jump in the ocean
and when a train goes by
it's such a sad sound
I'd like to drop my trousers to the Queen
every sensible child will know what this means
the poor and the needy
are selfish and greedy on her terms
and if the day came when I felt a natural emotion
I'd get such a shock I'd probably jump in the ocean
and when a train goes by
it's such a sad song
And when I'm lying in my bed
I think about life
and I think about death
and neither one particularly appeals to me
and if the day came when I felt a natural emotion
I'd get such a shock I'd probably lie
in the middle of the street and die
I'd lie down and die

 

WELL I WONDER

Well I wonder
do you hear me when you sleep?
I hoarsely cry
Well I wonder
do you see me when we pass?
I half-die
Please keep me in mind
please keep me in mind
Gasping-but somehow still alive
this is the fierce last stand of all I am
Gasping-dying-but somehow still alive
this is the final stand of all I am
Please keep me in mind

 

BARBARISM BEGINS AT HOME

Unruly boys
who will not grow up
must be taken in hand
Unruly girls
who will not settle down
they must be taken in hand
A crack on the head
is what you get for not asking
and a crack on the head
is what you get for asking

 

MEAT IS MURDER

Heifer whines could be human cries
closer comes the screaming knife
this beautiful creature must die
this beautiful creature must die
a death for no reason
and death for reason is MURDER
and the flesh you so fancifully fry
is not succulent, tasty or nice
it's death for no reason
and death for no reason is MURDER
and the calf that you carve with a smile
is MURDER
and the turkey you festively slice
is MURDER
do you know how animals die?
kitchen aroma aren't very homely
it's not "comforting," "cheery" or kind
it's sizzling blood and the unholy stench
of MURDER
it's not "natural," "normal" or kind
the fleas you so fancifully fry
as you savour the flavour
of MURDER
NO, NO, NO, IT'S MURDER
NO, NO, NO, IT'S MURDER
who hears when animals cry?

 

THE QUEEN IS DEAD

Farewell to this lands cheerless marches
hemmed in like a boar between arches
her very Lowness with her head in a sling
Im truely sorry-but it sounds like a wonderful thing
dear Charles, dont you ever crave
to appear on the front of the Daily mail
dressed in your Mother's bridal veil?
So, I checked all the registered historical facts
and I was shocked into shame to discover
how Im the 18th pale descendent
of some, old queen or other
has the world changed, or have I changed?
has the world changed, or have I changed?
as some 9-year old tough peddles drugs
(I never even knew what drugs were)
And so, I broke into the Palace
with a sponge and a rusty spanner
she said: "Eh, I know you, and you cannot sing"
I said: "that's nothing -you should hear me play piano"
We can go for a walk where it's quiet and dry
and we can talk about precious things
but when you are tied to your mother's apron
not one talks about castration
We can go for a walk where it's quiet and dry
and we can talk about precious things
like love and law and poverty
these are the things that kill me
We can go for a walk where it's quiet and dry
and we can talk about precious things
but the rain that flattens my hair
theses are the things that kill me
Passed the Pub that saps your body
and the church who'll snatch your money
the Queen is dead, boys
and it's so lonely on a limb
Pass the Pub that wrecks your body
and the church-all they want is your money
the Queen is dead, boys`
you can trust me, boys
life is very long, when you're lonely
life is very long, when you're lonely...

 

FRANKLY MR.SHANKLY

Frankly, Mr Shankly, this position Ive held
it pays my way, but it corrodes my soul
I want to leave you will not miss me
I want to go down in musical history
Frankly, Mr Shankly, Im a sickening wreck
Ive got the 21st Century breathing down my neck
I must move fast, you understand me
I want to go down in celluloid history
Fame, Fame, fatal Fame
it can play hideous tricks on the brain
but still I rather be Famous
than righteous or holy, any day
but sometimes Id feel more fulfilled
making Christmas cards with the mentally ill
I want to Live and I want to Love
I want to catch something that I might be ashamed of
Frankly, Mr Shankly, this position I've held
it pays my way and it corrodes my soul
oh, I didnt realise that you wrote poetry
(I didnt realise you wrote such bloody awful poetry)
Frankly, Mr Shankly, since you ask
you are a flatulent pain the arse
I do not mean to be so rude
but still, I must speck frankly, Mr Shankly

 

I KNOW IT'S ALL OVER

Oh Mother, I can fell the soil falling over my head
and as i climb into an empty bed
Oh well, Enough said
I know it's over-still I cling
I don't know where else I can go
Oh Mother, I can feel the soil falling over my head
see, the sea want s to take me
the knife wants to cut me
do you think you can help me?
Sad veiled bride, please be happy
handsome groom, give her room
loud, loutish lover, treat her kindly
(although she needs you
more than she loves you)
and I know it's over
and it never really began
but in my heart it was so real
and you even spoke to me and said:
"If you're so funny
then why are you on your own tonight?
and if you are so clever
then why are you on your own tonight?
if you're so terribly good looking
then why do you sleep alone tonight?
because tonight is just like any other night
that's why you're on your own tonight
with your triumphs and your charms
while they are in each other's arms.."
It's so easy to laugh
it's so easy to hate
it takes strength to be gentle and kind
It's so easy to laugh
it's so easy to hate
it takes guts to be gentle and kind
love is Natural and Real
but not for you, my love
not tonight my love
love is Natural and Real
but not for such as you and I, my love
Oh Mother, I can fell the soil falling over my head
Oh Mother, I can fell the soil falling over my head...

 

NEVER HAD NO ONE EVER

When you walk without ease
on these
the very streets where you were raised
I had a really bad dream
it lasted 20 years, 7 months, and 27 days
Never had no one ever.

 

CEMETERY GATES

A dreaded sunny day
so I meet you at the cemetry gates
Keats and Yeats are on your side
A dreaded sunny day
so I meet you at the cemetry gates
Keats and Yeats are on your side
while Wilde is on mine
So we go inside and we gravely read the stones
all those people all those lives
where are they now ?
with loves, and hates
and passions just like mine
they were born
and then they lived and then they died
which seems so unfair
and I wantr to crv
You say: "ere thrice the sun hath done salutation to the dawn"
and you claim these words as your own
but Im well-read, have heard them said
a hundred times (maybe less, maybe more)
if you must write prose/poems
the words you use should be your own
dont plagiarise or take "on loans"
there's alweays someone, somewhere
with a big nose, who knows
and who trips you up and laughs
when you fall
You say: "ere long done do does did "
words which could only be your own
you then produce the text
from whence was ripped
(some dizzy whore, 1804)
A dreaded sunny day
so let's go where we're happy
so I meet you at the cemetry gates
Keats and Yeats are on your side
A dreaded sunny day
so let's go where we're wanted
so I meet you at the cemetry gates
Keats and Yeats are on your side
but you lose
because Wilde is on mine

 

BIGMOUTH STRIKES AGAIN

Sweetness, sweetness I was only joking
when I said Id like to smash every tooth
in your head
Sweetness, sweetness I was only joking
when I said by right s you should be
bludgeoned in your bed
and now I know how Joan of Arc felt
now I know how Joan of Arc felt
as the flames roseto her roman nose
and her Walkman stared to melt
Bibmouth, bigmouth
bigmouth strikes again
and Ive got no right to take my place
with the Human race
and now I know how Joan of Arc felt
now I know of Joan of Arc felt
as the flames rose to her roman nose
and her hearing aid started to melt
Bigmouth, bigmouth
bigmouth strikes again
and Ive got no right to take my place
with the Human race

 

THE BOY WITH A THORN IN HIS SIDE

The boy with the thorn in his side
behind the hatred there lies
a murderous desire for love
how can they look into my eyes
and still they dont believe me
how can they hear me say those words
and still they dont believe me
and if they don't believe me now
will they ever believe me?
and if they don't believe me now
will they ever believe me?
The boy with the thorn in his side
behind the hatred there lies
a plundering desire for love
how can they see the Love in our eyes
and still they don't believe us
and after all this time
they don't want to believe us
and if they dont believe us now
will they ever believe us ?
andd when you want to Live
how do you start ?
where do you go ?
who do you know?

 

VICAR IN A TUTU

I was minding mind business
lifting some lead off
the roof of the Holy Name church
it was worthwhile living a laughable life
just to set my eyes on a blistering sight
of a vicar in a tu-tu
he's not strange
he just wants to live his life this way
a scanty bit of a thing
with a decorative ring
that wouldn't cover the head of a child
as Rose collects the money in the cannister
who comes sliding down the bannister
the vicar in a tu-tu
he's not strange
he just wants to live his life this way
the monkish monsignor
with a head full of plaster
said "my man, get your vile soul dry-cleaned"
as Rose counts the money in the cannister
as natural as rain
he dances again
vicar in a tu-tu
The next day in the pulpit
with Freedom and Ease
combating ignoranca,dust and disease
as Rose counts the money in the cannister
as natural as rain
he dances again
the fabric of a tu-tu
any man could get us to
and I am a living sign.

 

THERE IS A LIGHT THAT NEVER GOES OUT

Take me out tonight
where there's music and there's people
who are young and alive
driving in your car
I never never want to go home
because I havent got one
anymore
take me out tonight
because I want to see people and I
want to see lights
driving in your car
oh please dont drop me home
because it's not my home, it's their
home, and Im welcome no morw
and if a double-decker bus
crashes in to us
to die by your side
such a heavenly way to die
and if a ten ton truck
kills the both of us
to die by your side
the pleasure and the privilege is mine
take me out tonight
oh take me anywhere, I dont care
and in the darken underpass
I thought Oh God, my chance has come at last
(but then a strange fear gripped me and I just couldn't ask)
take me out tonight
take me anywhere, I dont care
just driving in your car
I never never want to go home
because I havent got one
I havent got one.

 

SOME GIRLS ARE BIGGER THAN OTHERS

From the ice-age to the dole-age
there is but one concern
and I have just discover
some girls are bigger than others
some girls are bigger than others
some girls mothers are bigger than
other girls mothers
As Anthony said to Cleopatra
as he opened a crate of ale:
some girls are bigger than others
some girls are bigger than others
some girls mothers are bigger than
other girls mothers.

 

A RUSH AND A PUSH AND AND THE LAND IS OURS

HELLO
I am the ghost of Troubled Joe
hung by his pretty white neck
some eighteen months ago
I travelled to a mystical time zone
but I missed my bed
so I soon came home
they said:
"there's too much caffeine
in your bloodstream
and a lack of real spice
in your life"
I said:
"leave me alone
because I'm alright, dad
just surprised to still
be on my own...."
Ooh, but don't mention love
I'd hate the real strain of the pain again
a rush and a push and the land that
we stand on is ours
it has been before
so it shall be again
and people who are uglier than you and I
they take what they need, and leave
Ooh, but don't mention love
I'd hate the pain and the strain all over again
a rush and a push and the land that
we stand on is ours
it has been before
so why can't it be now?
and people who are weaker than you and I
they take what they want from life
Ooh, but don't mention love
no - just don't mention love!
a rush and a push and the land that
we stand on is ours
your youth may be gone
but you're still a young man
so phone me, phone me, phone me
so phone me, phone me, phone me
Ooh, I think I'm in love...
Urrgh, I think I'm in lerv

 

I STARTED SOMETHING I COULDN'T FINISH

The lanes were silent
with nothing or no one around for miles
I doused our friendly venture
with a hard-faced
three-word gesture
I started something
I forced you into a zone
and you were clearly
never meant to go
hair brushed and parted
typical me, typical me, typical me
I started something
...and now I'm not too sure
I grabbed you by the guilded beams
that's what Tradition means
and I doused another venture
with a gesture
that was...absolutely vile
I started something
forced you to a zone
and you were clearly
never meant to go
hair brushed and parted
typical me, typical me, typical me
I started something
...and now I'm not too sure
I grabbed you by the guilded beams
that's what Tradition means
and now eighteen months' hard-labour
seems...fair enough
I started something
forced you to a zone
and you were clearly
never meant to go
hair brushed and parted
typical me, typical me, typical me
I started something
and now I'm not too sure

 

DEATH OF A DISCO DANCER

The death of a disco dancer
well, it happens a lot 'round here
and if you think Peace
is a common goal
well, that goes to show
just how little you know
The death of a disco dancer
well, I'd rather not get involved
I never talk to my neighbour
I'd just rather not get involved
Love, peace and harmony?
Love, peace and harmony?
Oh, very nice, very nice, very nice, very nice
...but maybe in the next world.

 

GIRLFRIEND IN A COMA

Girlfriend in a coma, I know
I know - it's serious
Girlfriend in a coma, I know
I know - it's really serious
there wree times when I could
have 'murdered' her
(but, you know, I would hate
anything to happen to her)
NO, I DON'T WANT TO SEE HER
Do you really think
she'll pull through?
Do you really think
she'll pull through?
Girlfriend in a coma, I know
I know, it's serious
there were time when I could
have 'strangeled' her
(but, you know, I would hate
anything to happen to her)
WOULD YOU PLEASE LET ME SEE HER!
Do you really think she'll pull through?
Do you really think she'll pull through?
Let me wisper my last goodbyes
I know - IT'S SERIOUS

 

STOP ME IF YOU'VE HEARD THIS ONE BEFORE

Stop me, stop me,
stop me if you think that you've heard this one before
stop me, stop me
stop me if you think that you've heard this one before
nothing's changed
I still love you, oh I still love you
...only slightly less than I used to
I was delayed, I was way-laid
an emergency stop
I smelt the last ten seconds of life
I crashed down on the crossbar
and the pain was enough to make
a shy, bald buddhist reflect
and plan a mass-murder
who said I'd lied to her?
who said I'd lied because I never
who said I'd lied because I never
I was detained, I was restrained
he broke my spleen
he broke my knees
(and then he really laid into me)
Friday night in Out-patients
who said I'd lied to her?
who said I'd lied - because I never
who said I'd lied - because I never
Oh, so I drank one
or was it four
and when I fell on the floor
...I drank more
stop me, stop me
stop me if you think that you've heard this one before
nothing's changed
I still love you, I still love you
but only slightly
less than I used to

 

LAST NIGHT I DREAMT THAT SOMEBODY LOVED ME

Last night I dreamt
that somebody loved me
no hope - but no harm
just another false alarm
Las night I felt
real arms around me
no hope - no harm
just another false alarm
so, tell me how long
before the last one?
and tell me how long
before the right one?
this story is old - I KNOW
but it goes on
this story is old - I KNOW
but it goes on

 

UNHAPPY BIRTHDAY

I've come to wish you an unhappy birthday
I've come to wish you an unhappy birthday
because you're evil
and you lie
and if you should die
I may feel slightly sad
(but I won't cry)
Loved and lost
and some may say
when usually its Nothing
surely you're happy
it should be this way?
I say "No, I'm gonna kill my dog"
and: "May the lines sag heavy
and deep tonight XXX"
I've come to wish you an unhappy birthday
I've come to wish you an unhappy birthday
because you're evil
and you lie
and if you should die
I may feel slightly sad
(But I won't cry)
Loved and lost
some people say
when usually its Nothing
surely you're happy
it should be this way?
I said "No"
and then I shot myself
so, drink, drink, drink
and be ill tonight
from the one you left behind
from the one you left behind...

 

PAINT A VULGAR PICTURE

At the record company meeting
On their hands - a dead star
and ooh, the plans that they weave
and ooh, the sikening greed
At the record company meeting
on their hands - a dead star
the sycophantic slags all say:
"I knew him first, and I knew him well"
Re-issue! Re-package! Re-package!
Re-evaluate the songs
double-pack with a photograph
Extra Track (and a tacky badge)
A-list, playlist
"Please them, please them!"
"Please them! Please them!"
(sadly, THIS was your life)
but you could have said no
if you'd wanted to
you could have said no
if you'd wanted to
BPI, MTV, BBC
"Please them! Please them!"
(sadly this was your life)
but you could have said no
if you'd wanted to
you could have walked away
...couldn't you?
I touched you at the soundcheck
you had no real way of knowing
in my heart I bgged "please, take
me with you...
I don't care where you're going"
But to you I was faceless
I was fawning, I was boring
just a child from those ugly new houses
who could never begin to know
who could never really know
Best of? Most of?
Satiate the need
slip them into different sleeves!
Buy both, and be decieved
climber - new entry, re-entry
World tour! ("media whore")
"Please the Press in Belgium!"
(THIS was your life...)
and when it fails to recoup?
Well, maybe:
You just haven't earned it yet, baby
I walked a pace behind you at the soundcheck
you're just the same as I am
what makes most people feel happy
leads us headlong into harm
so, in my bedroom in those 'ugly new houses'
I dance my legs down to the knees
but me and my 'true love'
we will never meet again...
At the record company meeting
on their hands - at last! - a dead star!
but they cannot taint you in my eyes
no, they cannout touch you now
No, they cannot hurt you my darling
they cannot touch you now
but me and my 'true love'
will never meet again

 

DEATH AT ONE'S ELBOW

Ooh Glenn, don't come to the house tonight
Ooh, Glenn, don't come to the house tonight
because there's somebody here
who really really loves you
stay home
be bored
(it's crap, I KNOW)
Ooh, Glenn, don't come to the house tonight
Ooh, Glen, don't come to the house tonight
because there's somebody here
who'll take a hatchet to your ear
how the frustration renders me
hateful, Glenn!
don't come to the house tonight
don't come to the house tonight
because you'll slip on the
trail of my bespattered remains
and so, that's why
GOODBYE MY LOVE, GOODBYE MY LOVE, GOODBYE MY LOVE...
Belch

 

I WON'T SHARE YOU

I won't share you
I won't share you
with the drive and ambition
and the zeal I feel
this is my time
as the note I wrote
was read, she said
has the Perrier gone
straight to my head
or is life plainly sick and cruel, instead?
"YES!"
No-no-no-no-no-no
I won't share you
I won't share you
with the drive and the dreams inside
this is my time
Life tends to come and go
well, that's OK
just as long as you know
Life tends to come and go
well, that's OK
just as long as you know
I won't share you
I won't share you
with the drive and the dreams inside
this is my time, this is my time


THE QUEEN IS DEAD

Farewell to this lands cheerless marches
hemmed in like a boar between arches
her very Lowness with her head in a sling
Im truely sorry-but it sounds like a wonderful thing
dear Charles, dont you ever crave
to appear on the front of the Daily mail
dressed in your Mother's bridal veil?
So, I checked all the registered historical facts
and I was shocked into shame to discover
how Im the 18th pale descendent
of some, old queen or other
has the world changed, or have I changed?
has the world changed, or have I changed?
as some 9-year old tough peddles drugs
(I never even knew what drugs were)
And so, I broke into the Palace
with a sponge and a rusty spanner
she said: "Eh, I know you, and you cannot sing"
I said: "that's nothing -you should hear me play piano"
We can go for a walk where it's quiet and dry
and we can talk about precious things
but when you are tied to your mother's apron
not one talks about castration
We can go for a walk where it's quiet and dry
and we can talk about precious things
like love and law and poverty
these are the things that kill me
We can go for a walk where it's quiet and dry
and we can talk about precious things
but the rain that flattens my hair
theses are the things that kill me
Passed the Pub that saps your body
and the church who'll snatch your money
the Queen is dead, boys
and it's so lonely on a limb
Pass the Pub that wrecks your body
and the church-all they want is your money
the Queen is dead, boys`
you can trust me, boys
life is very long, when you're lonely
life is very long, when you're lonely...

 

PANIC

Panic on the streets of London
Panic on the streets of Birmingham
I wonder to myself
Could life ever be sane again
on the Leeds side-streets that you slip down
I wonder to myself
Hopes may rise on the Grasmeres
But Honey Pie, you're not safe here
So you run down
To the safety of the town
But there's Panic on the streets of Carlisle
Dublin, Dundee, Humberside
I wonder to myself
Burn down the Disco
Hang the blessed D.J.
Because the music that they constantly play
IT SAYS NOTHING TO ME ABOUT MY LIFE
Hang the blessed D.J.
Because the music they constantly play
On the Leeds side-streets that you slip down
On the provincial towns that you jog 'round
Hang the D.J.,. Hang the D.J.,.Hang the D.J...

 

VICAR IN A TUTU

I was minding mind business
lifting some lead off
the roof of the Holy Name church
it was worthwhile living a laughable life
just to set my eyes on a blistering sight
of a vicar in a tu-tu
he's not strange
he just wants to live his life this way
a scanty bit of a thing
with a decorative ring
that wouldn't cover the head of a child
as Rose collects the money in the cannister
who comes sliding down the bannister
the vicar in a tu-tu
he's not strange
he just wants to live his life this way
the monkish monsignor
with a head full of plaster
said "my man, get your vile soul dry-cleaned"
as Rose counts the money in the cannister
as natural as rain
he dances again
vicar in a tu-tu
The next day in the pulpit
with Freedom and Ease
combating ignoranca,dust and disease
as Rose counts the money in the cannister
as natural as rain
he dances again
the fabric of a tu-tu
any man could get us to
and I am a living sign.

 

ASK

Shyness is nice, but
Shyness can stop you
From doing all the things in life
That you'd like to
So, if there's something you'd like to try
ASK ME-I WON'T SAY "NO"-HOW COULD I?
Coyness is nice, but ,
Coyness can stop you
from saying all the things in
life that you want to
If there's something that you'd like to try
ASK ME-I WON'TSAY"NO"-HOW COULD I?
Spending warm, Summer days indoors
Writing fringhtening verse
To a buck-toothed girl in Luxembourg
ASK ME, ASK ME ,ASK ME, ASK ME, ASK ME ,ASK ME
Because if it's not Love
Then it's the Bomb
That will bring us together
Nature is a language-can't you read?
Nature is a language-can't you read?
ASK ME, ASK ME ,ASK ME, ASK ME, ASK ME ,ASK ME
Because if it's not Love
Then it's the Bomb
That will bring us together

 

MARIE'S THE NAME (HIS LATEST FLAME) / RUSHOLME RUFFIANS

Very old friend 
Came by today 
As he was telling everyone in town 
Of all the love that he'd just found 
And Marie's the name (of his latest flame) 
Talked and talked 
And I heard him say 
That she had the longest blackest hair 
Prettiest green eyes anywhere 
And Marie's the name (of his latest flame) 
The last night of the fair 
By the big wheel generator 
A boy is stabbed 
His money is grabbed 
And the air hangs heavy like a dulling wine 
She is Famous 
She is Funny 
An engagement ring 
Doesn't mean a thing 
To a mind consumed by brass (money), oh 
The last night of the fair 
From a seat on a whirling waltzer 
Her skirt ascends for a watching eye 
It's a hideous trait (on her mother's side)
From a seat on a whirling waltzer 
Her skirt ascends for a watching eye 
A hideous trait (on her mother's side) 
Then someone falls in love 
Someone's beaten up 
Someone's beaten up 
And the senses being dulled are mine 
And someone falls in love 
Someone's beaten up 
And the senses being dulled are mine 
This is the last night of the fair 
And the grease in the hair 
Of a speedway operator 
Is all a tremulous heart requires 
A schoolgirl is denied 
She said : "How quickly would I die 
If I jumped from the top of the parachutes ?"
This is the last night of the fair 
And the grease in the hair 
Of a speedway operator 
Is all a tremulous heart requires 
A schoolgirl is denied 
She said : "How quickly would I die 
Oh, if I jumped from the top of the parachutes ?"
...Oh, walk home alone 
I might walk home alone 
But my faith in love is still devout

 

THE BOY WITH THE THORN IN HIS SIDE

The boy with the thorn in his side
behind the hatred there lies
a murderous desire for love
how can they look into my eyes
and still they dont believe me
how can they hear me say those words
and still they dont believe me
and if they don't believe me now
will they ever believe me?
and if they don't believe me now
will they ever believe me?
The boy with the thorn in his side
behind the hatred there lies
a plundering desire for love
how can they see the Love in our eyes
and still they don't believe us
and after all this time
they don't want to believe us
and if they dont believe us now
will they ever believe us ?
andd when you want to Live
how do you start ?
where do you go ?
who do you know?

 

RUBBER RING / WHAT SHE SAID

Yeah! What she says : 
"How come someone hasn't noticed 
That I'm dead 
And decided to bury me ? 
God knows, I'm ready !"
La-la-la ... 
What she said was sad 
But then, all the rejection she's had 
To pretend to be happy 
Could only be idiocy 
La-la-la ... 
What she said was not for the job or 
Lover that she never had 
No no no ... 
What she read 
All heady books 
She'd sit and prophesise 
(It took a tattooed boy from 
Birkenhead 
To really really open her eyes)
What she read 
All heady books 
She'd sit and prophesise 
(It took a tattooed boy from 
Birkenhead 
To really really open her eyes)
What she said : 
"I smoke because I'm hoping for an 
Early death 
AND I NEED TO CLING TO SOMETHING !"
What she said : 
"I smoke because I'm hoping for an 
Early death 
AND I NEED TO CLING TO SOMETHING !"
No no no no ...

 

IS IT REALLY SO STRANGE?

I left the North 
I travelled South 
I found a tiny house 
And I can't help the way I feel 
Oh yes, you can kick me 
And you can punch me 
And you can break my face 
But you won't change the way I feel 
'Cause I love you, Oh ... 
And is it really so strange ? 
Oh, is it really so strange ? 
Oh, is it really so, really so strange ? 
I say NO, you say YES 
(and you will change your mind) 
I left the South 
I travelled North 
I got confused - I killed a horse 
I can't help the way I feel 
Oh yes, you can punch me 
And you can butt me 
And you can break my spine 
But you won't change the way I feel 
'Cause I love you, Oh ... 
And is it really so strange ? 
Oh, is it really so strange ? 
Oh, is it really so, really so strange ? 
I say NO, you say YES 
(But you will change your mind) 
I left the North again 
I travelled South again 
And I got confused - I killed a nun 
I CAN'T HELP THE WAY I FEEL 
(I lost my bag in Newport Pagnell) 
Why is the last mile the hardest mile ? 
My throat was dry, with the sun in my eyes 
And I realised, I realised 
I could never 
I could never, never, never, go back home again

 

CEMETERY GATES

A dreaded sunny day
so I meet you at the cemetry gates
Keats and Yeats are on your side
A dreaded sunny day
so I meet you at the cemetry gates
Keats and Yeats are on your side
while Wilde is on mine
So we go inside and we gravely read the stones
all those people all those lives
where are they now ?
with loves, and hates
and passions just like mine
they were born
and then they lived and then they died
which seems so unfair
and I wantr to crv
You say: "ere thrice the sun hath done salutation to the dawn"
and you claim these words as your own
but Im well-read, have heard them said
a hundred times (maybe less, maybe more)
if you must write prose/poems
the words you use should be your own
dont plagiarise or take "on loans"
there's alweays someone, somewhere
with a big nose, who knows
and who trips you up and laughs
when you fall
You say: "ere long done do does did "
words which could only be your own
you then produce the text
from whence was ripped
(some dizzy whore, 1804)
A dreaded sunny day
so let's go where we're happy
so I meet you at the cemetry gates
Keats and Yeats are on your side
A dreaded sunny day
so let's go where we're wanted
so I meet you at the cemetry gates
Keats and Yeats are on your side
but you lose
because Wilde is on mine

 

LONDON

Smoke
Lingers 'round your fingers
Train
Heave on - to Euston
Do you think you've made
The right decision this time?
You left
Your tired family grieving
And you think they're sad because you're leaving
But didn't you see the Jealousy in the eyes
Of the ones who had to stay behind?
And do you think you've made
The right decision thins time?
You left
Your girlfriend on the platform
With thei really ragged notion that you'll return
But she knows
That when he goes
He really goes
So do you think you've made
The right decision this time?

 

I KNOW IT'S OVER

I can feel the soil falling over my head 
And as I climb into an empty bed 
Oh well. Enough said. 
I know it's over - still I cling 
I don't know where else I can go 
Over ... 
Oh Mother, I can feel the soil falling over my head 
See, the sea wants to take me 
The knife wants to cut me 
Do you think you can help me ? 
Sad veiled bride, please be happy 
Handsome groom, give her room 
Loud, loutish lover, treat her kindly 
(Though she needs you 
More than she loves you) 
And I know it's over - still I cling 
I don't know where else I can go 
Over, it's over, it's over, it's over 
It's over, la ... 
I know it's over 
And it never really began 
But in my heart it was so real
And you even spoke to me, and said : 
"If you're so funny 
Then why are you on your own tonight ? 
And if you're so clever 
Then why are you on your own tonight ? 
I know ... 
'Cause tonight - it's just like any other night 
That's why you're on your own tonight 
Your triumphs and your charms 
While they're in each other's arms..."
It's so easy to laugh 
It's so easy to hate 
It takes strength to be gentle and kind 
Over, over, over, over 
It's so easy to laugh 
It's so easy to hate 
It takes guts to be gentle and kind 
Over, over 
Love is Natural and Real 
But not for you, my love 
Not tonight, my love 
Love is Natural and Real 
But not for such as you and I, my love 
Oh Mother, I can feel the soil falling over my head...
Oh Mother, I can feel the soil fall over, fall over my head 
Oh Mother, I can feel the ... fall over my ... , Oh ...

 

THE DRAIZE TRAIN

A vastly superior version of the instrumental B-side, acting as a peace 
offering to Marr (Morrissey chose the tracks for the compilation, 
and of course, receives no royalties on this track).

 

STILL ILL

I decree today that life
is simply taking and not giving
England is mine and it owes me a living
ask me why, and I'll spit in your eye
ask me why, and I'll spit in your eye
but we cannot cling to the old dreams anymore
no, we cannot cling to the old dreams anymore
Does the body rule the mind
or does the mind rule the body?
I dunno...
Under the iron bridge we kissed
and although I ended up with sore lips
it just wasn't like the old days anymore
no, it wasn't like those days
am I still ill?
Does the body rule the mind
or does the mind rule the body ?
I dunno...
Ask me why, and I'll die
ask me why, and I'll die
and if you must go to work tomorrow
well, if I were you I wouldn't bother
for there are brighter sides to life
and I should know because I've seen them
but not very often...
under the iron bridge we kissed
and although I ended up with sore lips
it just wasn't like the old days anymore
no, it wasn't like those days
am I still ill?

 

BIGMOUTH STRIKES AGAIN

Sweetness, sweetness I was only joking
when I said Id like to smash every tooth
in your head
Sweetness, sweetness I was only joking
when I said by right s you should be
bludgeoned in your bed
and now I know how Joan of Arc felt
now I know how Joan of Arc felt
as the flames roseto her roman nose
and her Walkman stared to melt
Bibmouth, bigmouth
bigmouth strikes again
and Ive got no right to take my place
with the Human race
and now I know how Joan of Arc felt
now I know of Joan of Arc felt
as the flames rose to her roman nose
and her hearing aid started to melt
Bigmouth, bigmouth
bigmouth strikes again
and Ive got no right to take my place
with the Human race

 
ALSATIAN COUSTIN

Were you and he Lovers?
and would you say so if you were?
on a forecourt
on a Friday
passing my way
Were you and he Lovers?
and if you were, then say that you were!
on a groundsheet
under canvas
with your tent-flap
open wide
A note upon his desk:
"P.S. Bring Me Home And Have Me!"
Leather elbows on a tweed coat
- Oh! -
Is THAT the best you can do?
So came his reply:
"...but on the desk is where I want you!"
So I ask (even though I know):
were you and he Lovers?

 

LITTLE MAN, WHAT NOW?

An afternoon nostalgia
television show
you spoke in silhouette
(but they couldn't name you)
although the panel were
very polite to you
but I remembered you
from Friday nights 1969
ATV - you murdered every line
too old to be a child star
too young to take leads
four seasons passed
and they AXED you
nervously juvenile
(WON'T SMILE!)
What became of you?
did that swift eclipse torture you?
a star at eighteen
and then-suddenly gone
down to a few lines
in the back page of a teenage annual
oh but I remembered you
I looked up to you

 

EVERYDAY IS LIKE SUNDAY

Trudging slowly over wet sand
back to the bench
where your clothes were stolen
this is the coastal town
that they forgot to close down
Armageddon - come Armageddon!
Come Armageddon! Come!
Everyday is like Sunday
everyday is silent and grey
Hide on the promenade
scratch out a postcard
"how I dearly with I was not here"
in the seaside town
...that they forgot to bomb
Come! Come! Come - nuclear bomb!
Everyday is like Sunday
everyday is silent and grey
Trudging back over pebbles and sand
and a strange dust lands on your hands
(and on your face)
Everyday is like Sunday
"Win Yourself A Cheap Tray"
share some greased tea with me
everyday is silent and grey

 

BENGALI IN PLATFORMS

No no no
he does not want to depress you
oh no no no no no
he only wants to impress you
Bengali in platform
she only wants to embrace your culture
and to be your friend forever
Bengali, Bengali
oh shelve your Western plans
and understand that life is hard enough when you belong here
A silver-studded rim that glistens
and an ankle-star that...blinds me
a lemon sole so very high
which only reminds me, to tell you
so I break the news gently
I break the news to you gently
"Shelve your plans"
Bengali, Bengali
its the touchy march of time
that blinds you
don't blame me
don't hate me
just because I'm the one to tell you
that life is hard enough when you belong here
life is hard enough when you belong here
shelve your western plans
life is hard enough when you belong here

 

ANGEL, ANGEL, DOWN WE GO TOGETHER

Angel, Angel
don't take your life tonight
I know they take
and that they take in turn
and they give you nothing real
for yourself in return
and when they've used you
and they've broken you
and wasted all your money
and cast your shell aside
and when they've bought you
and they've sold you
and they've billed you for the pleasure
and they've made your parents cry
I will be here
BELIEVE ME
I will be here
...believe me
Angel, don't take your life
some people have got no pride
they do not understand
the Urgency of life
but I love you more than life
I love you more than life
I love you more than life
I love you more than life

 

LALE NIGHT, MAUDLIN STREET

The last night on Maudlin Street
goodbye house
goodbye stairs
I was born here
I was raised here, and
...I took some stick here
love at first sight
may sound trite
but it's true, you know
I could list the details
of everything you ever wore
or said, or how you stood that day
and as we spend the last night
on Maudlin Street, I say
"goodbye house-forever!"
I never stole a happy hour
around here
Where the world's ugliest boy
became what you see
here I am - the ugliest man
Its the last night on Maudlin Street
and truly I do love you
oh, truly I do love you
When I sleep with that picture of
you framed beside my bed
oh, it's childish and it's silly
but I think it's you in my room
by the bed (...yes, I told you it was silly...)
and I know
I took strange pills
but I never meant to hurt you
oh truly I love you
I came home late one night
everyone had gone to bed
nobody stays up for you
when you have sixteen stitches
all around your head
the last buss I missed to Maudlin Street
so, he drove me home in the Van
complaining: "Women only like me for my mind..."
don't leave your torch behind
power-cuts ahead
as we crept through the park
but no I cannot steal a pair of jeans
off a clothesline for you
but you...without clothes
oh I could not keep a straight face
me - without clothes?
well a nation turns its back and gags...
I'm packed
I am moving house
a half-life disappears today
every slag waves me on
(secretly wishing me gone
well, I will be soon
oh - I will be soon)
There were bad times on Maudlin Street
when they took you away in a police car
dear Inspector - don't you know?
don't you care?
don't you know - about Love?
Your gran died
and your mother died
on Maudlin Street
in pain and ashamed
with never time to say
those special things
I took the keys from Maudlin Street
well, it's only bricks and mortar!
and...truly I do love you
wherever you are
wherever you are

 

SUEDHEAD

Why do you come here
why do you hang around
I'm so sorry
I'm so sorry
Why do you come here
when you know it makes
things hard for me
when you know, oh
why do you come?
Why do you telephone?
and why send me silly notes?
I'm so sorry
I'm so sorry
why do you come here
when you know it makes
thing hard for me
when you know, oh
why do you come?
You had to sneak into my room
'just' to read my diary
was it just to see all the things
you knew I'd written about you?
and...so many illustrations
I'm so very sickened
oh, I am so sickened NOW

 

BREAK UP THE FAMILY

The strange logic of your clumsiest line
stayed emblazoned on my mind
break up the family
and lets begin to live our lives
I went to see all my friends tonight
it wasn't Youth, it wasn't even Life
born Old, sadly wise
resigned (well, we were)
to ending our lives
I'm so glad to grow older
to move away from those awful times
I want to see all my friends tonight
Yes you found love but you weren't
at peace with your life
home late, full of Hate
despise the ties that bind
oh I'm so glad to grow older
to move away from those younger years
now I'm in love for the first time
and I don't feel bad
Let me see all my old friends
let me put my arm around them
because I really do love them
now, does that sound mad?
Captain of games, solid framed
I stood on the touchline
hailstones, driven home
in his car - no breaks? I don't mind
I'm just so glad to grow older
to move away from those darker years
I'm in love for the first time
and I don't feel bad
so wish me luck my friends
goodbye

 

HAIRDRESSER ON FIRE

Here is London
here is London
is it home of the free,
or what?
can you squeeze me
into an empty page of your diary
and psychologically save me
I've got faith in you
I sense the power
in the fingers
within an hour the power
can totally destroy me
or it could same my life
here is London
'home of the brash, outrageous
and free'
you are repressed
but you're remarkably dressed
is it Real?
but you're far to busy
busy scissors
busy clippers
hair dresser on fire
all around Sloane Square
and you're far too busy
to see me
"busy,busy"
hairdresser on fire
was a client over-cautious
he made you nervous
and when he said
"I'm gonna sue you"
I really felt for you
so can you squeeze me
into an empty page of your diary
and supernaturally change me
CHANGE ME, CHANGE ME

 

THE ORDINARY BOYS

Ordinary boys, happy knowing nothing
happy being no one, but themselves
Ordinary girls, supermarket clothes
who think it's very clever to be cruel to you
for you were so different
you stood all alone
and you knew
that it had to be so
avoiding ordinary boys
happy going nowhere, just around here
in their rattling cars
and ordinary girls
never seeing further
than the cold, small streets
that trap them
but you were so different
you had to say no
when those empty fools
tried to change you, and claim you
for the lair of their ordinary world
where they feel so lucky
so lucky, so lucky
with their lives laid out before them
they're so lucky, so lucky
so lucky, so lucky

 

I DON'T MIND IF YOU FORGET ME

I don't mind
I don't mind if you forget me
having learned my lesson
I never left an impression on anyone
so now you send me your hardened 'regards'
when once you'd send me 'love'
sincerely I must tell you
your mild 'best wishes'
they make me suspicious
but I don't mind
I don't mind if you forget me
having learned my lesson
I never left
an impression on anyone
the pressure to change, to move on
was strange
and very strong
so this is why I tell you
I really do understand
BYE BYE
I don't mind if you forget me
no no no no no no no
REJECTION IS ONE THING
BUT REJECTION FROM A FOOL
IS CRUEL
REJECTION IS ONE THING
BUT REJECTION FROM A FOOL
IS CRUEL
and I don't mind if you forget me
I don't mind if your forget me

 

DIAL-A-CLICHE

Further into the fog I fall
well, I was just
following you!
when you said:
"Do as I do and scrap your fey ways"
(dial-a-cliche)
"grow up, be a man, and close your mealy-mouth!"
(dial-a-cliche)
But the person underneath
where does he go?
does he slide by the wayside?
or...does he just die?
when you find that you've organized
your feelings, for people
who didn't like you then
and certainly don't like you now
yet still you say:
"Do as I do and scrap your fey ways"
(dial-a-cliche)
"grow up, be a man, and close your mealy-mouth!"
(dial-a-cliche)
"the Safe way is the only way!
there's always time to change, son!"
yes well I've changed
but I'm in pain!
dial-a-chiche

 

MARGARET ON THE GUILLOTINE

The kind people
have a wonderful dream
Margaret on the guillotine
because people like you
make me feel so tired
when will you die?
when will you die?
when will you die?
when will you die?
when will you die?
because people like you
make me feel so old inside
please die
and kind people
do not shelter this dream
make it real
make the dream real
make the dream real
make it real

 

OUR FRANK

Our frank and open
deep conversations
they get me nowhere
they bring me down, so
give it a rest, won't you?
give me a cigarette
God give me patience
just no more conversation
Give us a drink
and make it quick
or else I'm gonna be sick
sick all over
your frankly vulgar
red pullover
now see how the colours blend
Our frank and open
deep conversations
they get me nowhere
they bring me down, so
give it a rest, won't you?
now will you just give over
the world may be ending
but look, I'm only human
Give us a drink
and make it quick
or else I'm gonna be sick
all over
your frankly vulgar
red pullover
now see how the two colours blend
Won't somebody stop me
from thinking all the time
about everything
so deeply
so bleakly

 

ASIAN RUT

Day oh so late
strangely the sun still shone
oh Asian boy
what are you on?
Day oh so late
strangely the sun still shone
what drugs are you on?
Tooled-up Asian boy
has come here to avenge
the cruel, cold killing
of his very best friend
Tooled-up Asian boy
has come here to take revenge
for the cruel, cold killing
of his only friend
Peace through the school
so quiet in the hall
it's a strange sign for one
of what's to come
Tough and hard and pale
oh they may just impale you on railings
oh English boys
it must be wrong
three against one?
Brakes slammed, and
a gun jammed, and
as far as I could tell
brave Asian boy
dealt a blow and fell
I'm just passing through here
on my way to somewhere civilised
and maybe I'll even arrive
maybe I'll even arrive?

 

SING YOUR LIFE

Sing your life
any fool can think of words that rhyme
many others do
why don't you?
do you want to?
Sing your life
just walk right up to the microphone
and name
all the things that you love
all the things that you loathe
sing your life
all the things that you love
all the things that you loathe
oh sing your life
oh sing your life
Others sang your life
but now's your chance to shine
and have the pleasure of
saying what you mean
the rare pleasure of
meaning what you sing
oh, make no mistake, my friend
all of this will end
so sing it now
all the things you love
all the things you loathe
oh sing your life
all the things that you love
all the things that you loathe
oh sing your, oh sing your
Don't leave it all unsaid
somewhere in the wasteland of your head
and make no mistake, my friend
your pointless life will end
but before you go
can you look at the truth?
You have a lovely singing voice
a lovely singing voice
and all of those
who sing on key
they stole the notion
from you and me

 

MUTE WITNESS

Your poor witness
crying so loudly on the floor
oh but she's only trying to tell you
what it was that she saw
she is only trying to tell you
what it was that she saw
Now see her standing on the table
with her small arms flailing
and you feel such compassion
in your soul for
Your poor mute witness
still testing the strength
of our patience
oh but she's only trying to tell you
what it was that she saw
Now see her pointing to the frisbee
with a memory too fuzzy
as her silent words
describe the fright of last night
4 a.m. Norhtside, Clapham Common
who knows what she was doing there?
will she sketch the answer later?
Well, I'll ask her
"now dry your tears, my dear"
Now see her mime in time so nicely
it would all have been so clear
is only she had never volunteered
"your taxi is here, my dear"

 

KING LEER

Your boyfriend, he
went down on one knee
well, could it be
he's only got one knee?
I tried to surprise you
with Vodka
or, Tizer
I can't quite remember
but you didn't thank me
you didn't even thank me
because you never do
Your boyfriend, he
has the gift of the gab
or, could it be
the gift of the grab?
I tried to surprise you
I lay down beside you
and...nothing much happened
and you didn't phone me
you didn't even phone me
because it's not your style
to dial
Your boyfriend, he
displays to me
more than just
a hint of cruelty
I tried to surprise you
I crept up behind you
with a homeless chihuahua
you gushed for an hour
you handed him back and said
"You'll never guess
I'm bored now"

 

FOUND FOUND FOUND

found found found found found found
someone who's worth it
in this murkiness
someone who's never
seeming scheming
found found found found found found
someone who's worth it
in this murkiness
someone who's never
seeming scheming
Oh, but if I'd never found
oh, but if I'd never found
oh, but if I'd never found
I do believe that
the more you give your love
and I do believe that
the more you offer trust
the more you chase
the more you cry
the more you're bound to lose
the more you're bound to lose
Oh, but if I'd never found
oh, but if I'd never found
somebody
who wants to be
who wants to be
with me
all the time

 

DRIVING YOUR GIRLFRIEND HOME

I'm driving
your girlfriend home
and she's saying
how she never chose you
"turn left", she says
so I turn left
and she says
"So how did I end up
so deeply involved in
the very existence
I planned on avoiding?"
and I can't answer
I'm driving
your girlfriend home
and she's laughing
to stop herself crying
"drive on", she says
so I drive on
and she says
"So how did I end up
attached to this person
when his sense of humour
gets gradually worser?"
and I can't tell her
I'm parking
outside her home
and we're shaking hands
goodnight, so politely

 

THE HARSH TRUTH OF THE CAMERA EYE

Churchillian legs
hair barely there
the harsh truth of the camera eye
Your eyes signal pain
because of the strain
of smiling
the harsh truth of the camera eye
telling you all
that you never wnated to know
showing what
you didn't want shown
My so friendly lens
zooms into
"the inner you"
and it tells the harsh truth
and nothing but
Laugh with us all here
that's if you can
then take the pictures home
and screamtelling you all
that you never wanted to know
showing you what
you didn't want shown
This photographer
he must have really had it in for you
"Oh, I don't want
to be judged anymore
I don't wnat to be judged
I would sooner be Loved
I would sooner be
just blindly Loved..."

 

(I'M) THE END OF THE FAMILY LINE

With no complications
fifteen generations
(of mine)
all honouring Nature
until I arrive
(with incredible style)
I'm the end fo the line
the end of the family line
the end of the line
No baby pulled screaming
out into this seething whirl
by chance or whim
(or even love?)
our family tree hacked into decline
and I'm spared the pain
of ever saying
("goodbye")
I'm the end of the line
the end of the family line
the end of the line

 

THERE'S A PLACE IN HELL FOR ME AND MY FRIENDS

There is a place
reserved
for me and my friends
and when we go
we all will go
so you see
I'm never alone
there is a place
with a bit more time
and a few more
gentler words
and looking back
we do forgive
(we had no choice
we always did)
all that we hope
is that when we go
our skin
and our blood
and our bones
don't get in your way
making you ill
the way they did
when we lived
There is a place
a place in hell
reserved
for me and my friends
and if ever I
wanted to cry
then I will
because I can

 

TONY THE PONY

Still drinking on the corner 
Just don't say I didn't warn you 
Always nagging big brother 
He's only looking out for you 
Tony The Pony 
Tony The Pony 
You're still standing on the corner 
Just don't say I didn't warn you 
Old and jealous big brother 
You had your time and you spent it 
Crying 
Now, Tony The Pony 
Tony The Pony 
So, that's what they call you now ? 
When you're free outside 
So cold and hard and in control 
And ... 
There's a free ride on 
Tony The Pony 
Oh, why do you always wanna stop me 
From doing the things in life that make me happy ? 
And when I'm outside with friends, laughing loudly 
Why do you always wanna stop me ? 
Oh, I would never 
I would never 
But you will carry the can for anyone 
The free ride on 
Gullible Tony 
You're drunker quicker 
And you're sicker even quicker 
For something heavy is gonna fall on you 
Oh ... 
And what do they call you now ? 
When you're free outside 
So cold and hard and in control 
And, oh ... been a lark 
There's a free ride on 
Fucked-up Tony 
I will never say I told you so 
Or how I knew that something bad 
Would happen to you 
I don't wanna say I told you so 
Oh, but Tony, I told you so !!! 
I told you so

 

YOU'RE GONNA NEED SOMEONE ON YOUR SIDE

With the world's fate 
Resting on your shoulder 
You're gonna need 
Someone on your side 
You can't do it by yourself 
Any longer 
You're gonna need 
Someone on your side 
Someone kindly told me 
That you'd wasted 
Eight of nine lives
Oh, give yourself a break 
Before you break down 
You're gonna need someone on your side 
And here I am, And here I am 
Well, you don't need 
To look so pleased ! 
Day or night, 
There is no difference 
You're gonna need someone on your side 
Day or night, 
There is no difference 
You're gonna need someone soon 
And here I am, And here I am 
Well, you don't need 
To look so pleased

 

GLAMOROUS GLUE

First day with the jar 
You find 
Everyone lies 
First day with the jar 
You find 
Everyone lies, nobody minds 
Everyone lies 
Where is the man you respect ? 
And where is the woman you love ? 
Where's the woman you love ? 
Third week with the jar
You find 
Everything dies 
We won't vote Conservative 
Because we never have 
Everyone lies, everyone lies 
Where is the man you respect ? 
And where is the woman you love ? 
Where's the woman you love ? 
Everything of worth 
On Earth Is there To share 
I used to dream, and I used to vow 
I wouldn't dream of it now 
We look to Los Angeles 
For the language we use 
London is dead, London is dead, London is dead...
Now I'm too much in love 
I'm too much in love 
I know 
I'll go 
Empty hand 
From the land

 

WE'LL LET YOU KNOW

How sad are we ? 
And how sad have we been ? 
We'll let you know 
We'll let you know 
Oh, but only if - you're really interested 
You wonder how 
We've stayed alive 'till now 
We'll let you know 
We'll let you know 
But only if - you're really interested 
We're all smiles 
Then, honest, I swear, it's the turnstiles 
That make us hostile 
Oh ... 
We will descend 
On anyone unable to defend 
Themselves 
Oh ... 
And the songs we sing 
They're not supposed to mean a thing 
La, la, la, la ... 
Oh ...You're lonely, Oh ... you're lonely, Oh ... 
GET OFF THE ROOF ! Oh ... 
Your Arsenal !
We may seem cold, or 
We may even be 
The most depressing people you've ever known 
At heart, what's left, we sadly know 
That we are the last truly British people you'll ever know 
We are the last truly British people you will ever know 
You'll never never want to know

 

THE NATIONAL FRONT DISCO

David, the wind blows 
The wind blows ... 
Bits of your life away 
Your friends all say ... 
"Where is our boy ? Oh, we've lost our boy" 
But they should know 
Where you've gone 
Because again and again you've explained that 
You're going to ... 
Oh, you're going to ... 
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah 
England for the English ! 
England for the English ! 
David, the winds blow 
The winds blow ...
All of my dreams away 
And I still say : 
"Where is our boy ? Ah, we've lost our boy" 
But I should know 
Why you've gone 
Because again and again you've explained
You've gone to the ... 
National, ah ... 
To the National .. 
There's a country; you don't live there 
But one day you would like to 
And if you show them what you're made of 
Oh, then you might do ... 
But David, we wonder 
We wonder if the thunder 
Is ever really gonna begin 
Begin, begin 
Your mom says : 
"I've lost my boy" 
But she should know 
Why you've gone 
Because again and again you've explained 
You've gone to the : 
National 
To the National 
To the National Front Disco 
Because you want the day to come sooner 
You want the day to come sooner 
You want the day to come sooner 
When you've settled the score 
Oh, the National 
Oh, the National

 

CERTAIN PEOPLE I KNOW

I take the cue from 
Certain people I know 
I use the cue 
And then I 
Hand it on to you 
And when I swing it 
So, it catches his eye ... 
(Weren't you there ? 
- You'd have died !) 
I trust the views of 
Certain people I know 
They look at Danger 
And they 
LAUGH THEIR HEADS OFF 
Their clothes are Imitation 
George the 23rd 
(Don't you find this absurd ?) 
I'd hate to be like 
Certain people I know 
They break their necks 
And can't afford to
Get them fixed 
Ah, they'd sacrifice all 
Of their principles for 
anything cashable 
I do believe it's terrible 
Oh, wo, wo, Ah, ah, ah, ah, Oh, wo, wo...

 

WE HATE IT WHEN OUR FRIENDS BECOME SUCCESSFUL

We hate it when our friends become successful 
We hate it when our friends become successful 
Oh, look at those clothes 
Now look at that face, it's so old 
And such a video ! 
Well, it's really laughable 
Ha, ha, ha ...
We hate it when our friends become successful 
And if they're Northern, that makes it even worse
And if we can destroy them 
You bet your life we will 
Destroy them 
If we can hurt them 
Well, we may as well ... 
It's really laughable 
Ha, ha, ha ... 
You see, it should've been me 
It could've been me 
Everybody knows 
Everybody says so 
They say : 
"Ah, you have loads of songs 
So many songs 
More songs than they'd stand 
Verse 
Chorus 
Middle eight 
Break, fade 
Just listen ..."
La, la-la, la-la

SEASICK, YET STILL DOCKED

I am a poor freezingly cold soul 
So far from where 
I intended to go 
Scavenging through life's very constant lulls 
So far from where I'm determined to go 
Wish I knew the way to reach the one I love
There is no way ... 
Wish I had the charm to attract the one I love 
But you see, I've got no charm 
Mmm...
Tonight I've consumed much more than I can hold 
Oh, this is very clear to you 
And you can tell I have never really loved 
You can tell, by the way, I sleep all day
And all of my life no-one gave me anything 
No-one has ever given me anything 
My love is as sharp as a needle in your eye 
You must be such a fool 
To pass me by

 

I KNOW IT'S GONNA HAPPEN SOMEDAY

My love, wherever you are 
Whatever you are 
Don't lose faith 
I know it's gonna happen someday 
To you 
Please wait ... Please wait ... Oh ... Wait ... 
Don't lose faith 
You say that the day just never arrives 
And it's never seemed so far away 
Still, I know it's gonna happen someday 
To you 
Please wait ... 
Don't lose faith

 

TOMORROW

Tomorrow 
Will it really come ? 
And if it does come 
Will I still be Human ? 
All I ask of you is one thing that you never do 
Would you put your arms around me ? 
(I won't tell anyone) 
Tomorrow 
Does it have to come ?
All I ask of you is one thing that you'll never do 
Would you put your arms around me ? 
(I won't tell anybody) 
Tomorrow 
And what must come before ...
Oh, the pain in my arms 
Oh, the pain in my legs 
Ooh, my shiftless body 
Tomorrow 
It's surely nearer now ? 
You don't think I'll make it 
I never said I wanted to ! 
Well did I ? 
Oh, the pain in my arms 
Oh, the pain in my legs 
Oh, yeah; oh, yeah, No, yeah; no, yeah 
Through my shiftless body 
Tomorrow, Tomorrow 
All I ask of you ... oh ... 
Is : would you tell me that you love me 
Tell me, tell me that you love me, Tell me, tell me that you love me ... 
Ah, I know you don't mean it 
Ah, I know you don't mean it 
Tell me, tell me that you love me, Tell me, tell me that you love me ...

Of their principles for 
anything cashable 
I do believe it's terrible 
Oh, wo, wo Ah, ah, ah, ah Oh, wo, wo...

 

THE NATIONAL FRONT DISCO

David, the wind blows 
The wind blows ... 
Bits of your life away 
Your friends all say ... 
"Where is our boy ? Oh, we've lost our boy" 
But they should know 
Where you've gone 
Because again and again you've explained that 
You're going to ... 
Oh, you're going to ... 
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah 
England for the English ! 
England for the English ! 
David, the winds blow 
The winds blow ...
All of my dreams away 
And I still say : 
"Where is our boy ? Ah, we've lost our boy" 
But I should know 
Why you've gone 
Because again and again you've explained
You've gone to the ... 
National, ah ... To the National .. 
There's a country; you don't live there 
But one day you would like to 
And if you show them what you're made of 
Oh, then you might do ... 
But David, we wonder 
We wonder if the thunder 
Is ever really gonna begin 
Begin, begin 
Your mom says : 
"I've lost my boy" 
But she should know 
Why you've gone 
Because again and again you've explained 
You've gone to the : 
National, To the National 
To the National Front Disco 
Because you want the day to come sooner 
You want the day to come sooner 
You want the day to come sooner 
When you've settled the score 
Oh, the National, Oh, the National…

 

NOVEMBER SPAWNED A MONSTER

Sleep on and dream of Love
because it's the closest you will get to love
poor twisted child, so ugly, so ugly
poor twisted child, oh hug me, oh hug me
one November spawned a monster 
in the shape of this child who later cried
"But Jesus made me, so Jesus save me from
pity, sympathy and people discussing me"
a frame of useless limbs what can make GOOD
all the BAD that's been done?
And if the lights were out
could you even bear
to kiss her full on the mouth (or anywhere?)
poor twisted child, so ugly, so ugly
poor twisted child, oh hug me, oh hug me
one November spawned a monster 
in the shape of this child who must remain
a hostage to kindess and the wheels underneath her
a hostage to kindess and the wheels underneath her
a symbol of where mad, mad lovers
must PAUSE and draw the line
So sleep and dream of love
because it's the closest
you will get to love
that November is a time which I must put OUT of my mind
oh one fine day 
LET IT BE SOON
she won't be rich or beautiful
but she'll be walking your streets
in the clothes that she went out
and chose for herself

 

SEASICK, YET STILL DOCKED

I am a poor freezingly cold soul 
So far from where 
I intended to go 
Scavenging through life's very constant lulls 
So far from where I'm determined to go 
Wish I knew the way to reach the one I love
There is no way ... 
Wish I had the charm to attract the one I love 
But you see, I've got no charm 
Mmm...
Tonight I've consumed much more than I can hold 
Oh, this is very clear to you 
And you can tell I have never really loved 
You can tell, by the way, I sleep all day
And all of my life no-one gave me anything 
No-one has ever given me anything 
My love is as sharp as a needle in your eye 
You must be such a fool 
To pass me by

 

THE LOOP

I just wanna say 
I haven't been away 
I'm still right here 
Where I always was 
So one day, if you're bored 
By all means call 
Because you can do 
(But only if you want to) 
I just wanna say 
I haven't been away 
I am still right here 
Where I always was 
So one day, when you're bored 
By all means call 
Because you can do 
But you might not get through

 

SISTER I'M A POET

All over this town 
Yes, a low wind may blow 
And I can see through everybo... 
With no reason 
To hide these words I feel 
And no reason 
To talk about the books I read 
But still I do 
That's 'cause I'm a ... Sister I'm a ... 
All over this town 
Along this way 
Outside the prison gates 
I love the romance of crime 
And I wonder 
Does anybody feel the way I do ? 
And is evil just something you are 
Or something you do ? 
Sister I'm a ... Sister I'm a ... 
All over this town, All over this town 
They pull over 
In their Citroen vans 
Not to shake your hand 
With meths on their breaths 
And you with youth on your side 
A plastic bag stranded at the lights 
This once was me ...
But now I'm a ... Sister I'm a ...
All over this town ... Oh, oh, oh 
All over this town, All over this town, Oh ... 
I still cannot speak French ... I am very lazy

 

JACK THE RIPPER

Oh, you look so tired 
Mouth slack and wide 
Ill-housed and ill-advised 
Your face is as mean 
As your life has been 
Crash into my arms 
I WANT YOU 
You don't agree -
But you don't refuse 
I know you 
And I know a place 
Where no one is likely to pass 
Oh, you don't care if it's late 
And you don't care if you're lost 
And oh, you look so tired 
(But tonight you presumed too much) 
Too much, too much 
And if it's the last 
Thing I ever do 
I'M GONNA GET YOU 
Crash into my arms 
I WANT YOU 
You don't agree -
But you don't refuse 
I know you 
And no one knows a thing about my life 
I can come and go as I please 
And if I want to, I can stay 
Oh, or if I want to, I can leave 
Nobody knows me, Nobody knows me, Nobody knows me Oh, oh...

 

SUCH A LITTLE THING MAKES SUCH A BIG DIFFERENCE

Such a little thing, such a little thing
but the difference it made was grave
there you go
wielding a bicycle chain
oh why won't you change
cange and be nicer?
such a little thing
a gentle tone of kindness
or written words on paper
- can you write?
How I love all of
the very simple things of life
(God's good air)
how I love all of
the very simple things of life
such a little thing
a fumbling politeness
the difference it saved me
wielding a bicycle chain
"I WILL NOT CHANGE AND I WILL NOT BE NICE"
Most people keep their brains between your legs (don't you find?)
Leave me alone - I was only singing, leave me alone because
I was only singing
leave me alone - I was only singing, leave me alone
you have just proved (again)
MOST PEOPLE KEEP THEIR BRAINS BETWEEN THEIR LEGS

 

I KNOW IT'S GONNA HAPPEN SOMEDAY

My love, wherever you are 
Whatever you are 
Don't lose faith 
I know it's gonna happen someday 
To you 
Please wait ... 
Please wait ... 
Oh ... Wait ... 
Don't lose faith 
You say that the day just never arrives 
And it's never seemed so far away 
Still, I know it's gonna happen someday 
To you 
Please wait ... 
Don't lose faith

 

WE'LL LET YOU KNOW

How sad are we ? 
And how sad have we been ? 
We'll let you know, We'll let you know 
Oh, but only if - you're really interested 
You wonder how 
We've stayed alive 'till now 
We'll let you know, We'll let you know 
But only if - you're really interested 
We're all smiles 
Then, honest, I swear, it's the turnstiles 
That make us hostile 
Oh ... We will descend 
On anyone unable to defend 
Themselves 
Oh ... And the songs we sing 
They're not supposed to mean a thing 
La, la, la, la ... Oh ...
You're lonely, Oh ... you're lonely 
Oh ... 
GET OFF THE ROOF !
Oh ... Your Arsenal !
We may seem cold, or 
We may even be 
The most depressing people you've ever known 
At heart, what's left, we sadly know 
That we are the last truly British people you'll ever know 
We are the last truly British people you will ever know 
You'll never never want to know

 

SUEDHEAD

Why do you come here
why do you hang around
I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry
Why do you come here
when you know it makes
things hard for me
when you know, oh
why do you come?
Why do you telephone?
and why send me silly notes?
I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry
why do you come here
when you know it makes
thing hard for me
when you know, oh
why do you come?
You had to sneak into my room
'just' to read my diary
was it just to see all the things
you knew I'd written about you?
and...so many illustrations
I'm so very sickened
oh, I am so sickened NOW

 

HE KNOWS I'D LOVE TO SEE HIM

He Knows (he knows)
Or, I think he does
because when I lived
in the Arse of the world...
he knows, he knows, he knows I'd love
to see him happy (or as close as is allowed)
because when I lived
in the Arse of the world
he knows, he knows, he knows I'd love
to see him happy (or as close as possible
as close as possible, as close as is allowed)
My name still conjours up deadly deeds
and a bad taste in the mouth
the police - they actually knew me
they said:
"You're just another person in the world
you're just another fool with radical views
you're just another who has maddening views
you want to turn it on its head
by staying in bed!"
I said: "I know I do"

 

YOU'RE GONNA NEED SOMEONE ON YOUR SIDE

With the world's fate 
Resting on your shoulder 
You're gonna need 
Someone on your side 
You can't do it by yourself 
Any longer 
You're gonna need 
Someone on your side 
Someone kindly told me 
That you'd wasted 
Eight of nine lives
Oh, give yourself a break 
Before you break down 
You're gonna need someone on your side 
And here I am, And here I am 
Well, you don't need 
To look so pleased ! 
Day or night, 
There is no difference 
You're gonna need someone on your side 
Day or night, 
There is no difference 
You're gonna need someone soon 
And here I am, And here I am 
Well, you don't need 
To look so pleased

 

GLAMOROUS GLUE

First day with the jar 
You find 
Everyone lies 
First day with the jar 
You find 
Everyone lies, nobody minds, Everyone lies 
Where is the man you respect ? 
And where is the woman you love ? 
Where's the woman you love ? 
Third week with the jar
You find 
Everything dies 
We won't vote Conservative 
Because we never have 
Everyone lies, everyone lies 
Where is the man you respect ? 
And where is the woman you love ? 
Where's the woman you love ? 
Everything of worth 
On Earth, Is there, To share 
I used to dream, and I used to vow 
I wouldn't dream of it now 
We look to Los Angeles 
For the language we use 
London is dead, London is dead, London is dead, ...
Now I'm too much in love 
I'm too much in love, 
I know I'll go 
Empty hand 
From the land

 

WE HATE IT WHEN OUR FRIENDS BECOME SUCCESSFUL

We hate it when our friends become successful 
We hate it when our friends become successful 
Oh, look at those clothes 
Now look at that face, it's so old 
And such a video ! 
Well, it's really laughable 
Ha, ha, ha ...
We hate it when our friends become successful 
And if they're Northern, that makes it even worse
And if we can destroy them 
You bet your life we will 
Destroy them 
If we can hurt them 
Well, we may as well ... 
It's really laughable 
Ha, ha, ha ... 
You see, it should've been me 
It could've been me 
Everybody knows 
Everybody says so 
They say : 
"Ah, you have loads of songs 
So many songs 
More songs than they'd stand 
Verse 
Chorus 
Middle eight 
Break, fade 
Just listen ..."
La, la-la, la-la

 

NOW MY HEART IS FULL

There's gonna be some trouble 
A whole house will need re-building 
And everyone I love in the house 
Will recline on an analyst's couch quite 
Soon 
Your Father cracks a joke 
And in the usual way 
Empties the room 
Tell all of my friends 
(I don't have too many 
Just some rain-coated lovers' puny brothers)
Dallow, Spicer, Pinkie, Cubitt 
Rush to danger 
Wind up nowhere 
Patric Doonan - raised to wait 
I'm tired again, I've tried again, and 
Now my heart is full 
Now my heart is full 
And I just can't explain 
So I won't even try to
Dallow, Spicer, Pinkie, Cubitt 
Every jammy Stressford poet 
Loafing oafs in all-night chemists 
Loafing oafs in all-night chemists 
Underact - express depression 
Ah, but Bunnie I loved you 
I was tired again 
I've tried again, and 
Now my heart is full 
Now my heart is full 
And I just can't explain 
So I won't even try to 
Could you pass by ? 
Could you pass by ? 
Oh ... 
Now my heart is full 
Now my heart is full 
And I just can't explain 
So ... slow ... 
Slow ... slow ... slow ... slow ... slow ...

 

SPRING-HEELED JIM

Spring-heeled Jim winks an eye 
He'll "do", he'll never be "done to" 
He takes on whoever flew through 
"Well, it's the normal thing to do" ... ah ... 
Spring-heeled Jim lives to love 
Now kissing with his mouth full 
And his eyes on some other fool 
So many women 
His head should be spinning 
Ah, but no ! 
Ah, but no ! 
But no !
Ah, no !
Spring-heeled Jim slurs the words : 
"There's no need to be so knowing
Take life at five times the 
Average speed, like I do" 
Until Jim feels the chill 
"Oh, where did all the time go ?" 
Once always in for the kill 
Now it's too cold 
And he feels too 
old 
Too old
Mmm, old... 
La, la, la, la-la, la ...

 

BILLY BUDD

Say, Billy Budd 
So you think you should ? 
Oh, everyone's laughing 
Say, Billy Budd 
So you think that you should ? 
Everyone's laughing ! 
Since I took up with you 
Things have been bad 
Yeah, but now it's 12 years on 
Now it's 12 years on 
Yes, and I took up with you 
I took my job application 
Into town 
Did you hear ? They turned me down 
Yes, and it's all because of us 
Oh, and what was in our eyes 
Oh, what was in our eyes, yeah 
I said, Billy Budd 
I would happily lose 
Both of my legs 
I would lose both of my legs 
Oh, if it meant you could be free 
Oh, if it meant you could be free 
(Don't leave us in the dark!)

 

HOLD ON TO YOUR FRIENDS

A bond of trust 
Has been abused 
Something of value 
May be lost 
Give up your job 
Squander your cash - be rash 
Just hold on to your friends 
There are more than enough 
To fight and oppose 
Why waste good time 
Fighting the people you like 
Who will fall defending your name 
Oh, don't feel so ashamed 
To have friends 
But now you only call me 
When you're feeling depressed 
When you feel happy I'm 
So far from your mind 
My patience is stretched 
My loyalty vexed 
Oh, you're losing all of your friends 
Hold on to your friends 
Hold on to your friends 
Resist - or move on 
Be mad, be rash 
Smoke and explode 
Sell all of your clothes 
Just bear in mind : 
Oh, there just might come a time 
When you need some friends

 

THE MORE YOU IGNORE ME, THE CLOSER I GET

The more you ignore me 
The closer I get 
You're wasting your time 
The more you ignore me 
The closer I get 
You're wasting your time 
I will be 
In the bar 
With my head 
On the bar 
I am now 
A central part 
Of your mind's landscape 
Whether you care 
Or do not 
Yeah, I've made up your mind 
The more you ignore me 
The closer I get 
You're wasting your time 
The more you ignore me 
The closer I get 
You're wasting your time 
Beware !
I bear more grudges 
Than lonely high court judges 
When you sleep 
I will creep 
Into your thoughts 
Like a bad debt 
That you can't pay 
Take the easy way 
And give in 
Yeah, and let me in 
Oh, let me in 
Oh let me ... 
Oh, let me in 
IT'S WAR 
IT'S WAR 
WAR 
WAR 
Oh, let me in 
Ah, the closer I get 
Ah, you're asking for it 
Ah, the closer I get 
Ooh, the closer I ...

 

WHY DON'T YOU FIND OUT FOR YOURSELF

The sanest days are mad 
Why don't you find out for yourself ? 
Then you'll see the price 
Very closely 
Some men here 
They have a special interest 
In your career 
They wanna help you to grow 
And then syphon all your dough 
Why don't you find out for yourself ? 
Then you'll see the glass 
Hidden in the grass 
You'll never believe me, so 
Why don't you find out for yourself ? 
Sick down to my heart 
That's just the way it goes 
Some men here 
They know the full extent of 
Your distress 
They kneel and pray 
And they say : 
"Long may it last" 
Why don't you find out for yourself ?
Then you'll see the glass 
Hidden in the grass 
Bad scenes come and go 
For which you must allow 
Sick down to my heart 
That's just the way it goes 
Don't rake up my mistakes 
I know exactly what they are 
And ... what do YOU do ? 
Well ... you just SIT THERE 
I've been stabbed in the back 
So many many times 
I don't have any skin 
But that's just the way it goes

 

I AM HATED FOR LOVING

I am hated for loving 
I am hated for loving 
Anonymous call, a poison pen 
A brick in the small of the back again 
I still don't belong 
To anyone - I am mine 
And I am hated for loving 
I am haunted for wanting 
Anonymous call, a poison pen 
A brick in the ... ah ... 
A brick in the small of the back again 
I still don't belong 
To anyone - I am mine 
I am falling 
With no-one to catch me 
I am falling 
And there's still 
No-one to catch me 
Ah .. 
Anonymous call, a poison pen 
A brick in the ... ah ... 
A brick in the small of the back again 
I just don't belong 
To anywhere 
I just don't belong 
Mmm ... 
Ah ...

 

LIFEGUARD SLEEPING, GIRL DROWNING

Always looking for attention 
Always needs to be mentioned 
Who does she 
Think she should be ? 
The shrill cry through darkening air 
Doesn't she know he's 
Had such a busy day ? 
Tell her ... sshhh
Somebody tell her ... sshhh 
Slowest ... 
It was only a test 
But she swam too far 
Against the tide 
She deserves all she gets 
The sky became marked with stars 
As an out-stretched arm slowly 
Disappears 
Hooray 
Oh hooray 
No, oh, oh, woh, there's no movement 
No, oh, hooray 
Oh, hooray 
Please don't worry 
There'll be no fuss 
She was ... nobody's nothing 
(What's your name ?) 
When he awoke 
The sea was calm 
And another day passes like a dream 
There's no ... no way 
(What's your name ?)

 

USED TO BE A SWEET BOY

Used to be a sweet boy 
Holding so tightly 
To Daddy's hand 
But that was all 
In some distant land 
Blazer and tie 
And a big bright healthy smile 
Used to make all 
Of our trials worthwhile 
Used to be a sweet boy 
And I'm not to blame 
Something went wrong 
And I know 
I'm not to blame 
Something went wrong 
Can't be to blame 
Ah ...

 

THE LAZY SUNBATHERS

A world war 
Was announced 
Days ago 
But they didn't know 
The lazy sunbathers 
The lazy sunbathers 
The sun burns through 
To the planet's core 
And it isn't enough 
They want more 
Nothing 
Appears 
To be 
Between the ears of 
The lazy sunbathers 
Too jaded 
To question stagnation 
The sun burns through 
To the planet's core 
And it isn't enough 
They want more 
Religions fall 
Children shelled 
"...Children shelled ? That's all 
Very well, but would you 
Please keep the noise 
Down low ? 
Because you're waking 
The lazy sunbathers ..."
Oh, the lazy sunbathers 
The lazy sunbathers

 

SPEEDWAY

And when you slam 
Down the hammer 
Can you see it in your heart ? 
All of the rumours 
Keeping me grounded 
I never said, I never said that they were 
Completely unfounded 
So when you slam 
Down the hammer 
Can you see it in your heart ? 
Can you delve so low ? 
And when you're standing 
On my fingers 
Can you see it in your heart ? ... ah ... 
And when you try 
To break my spirit 
It won't work 
Because there's nothing left to break 
Anymore 
All of the rumours 
Keeping me grounded 
I never said, I never said that they were 
Completely unfounded 
You won't sleep 
Until the earth that wants me 
Finally has me 
Oh you've done it now 
You won't rest 
Until the hearse that becomes me 
Finally takes me 
Oh you've done it now 
And you won't smile 
Until my loving mouth 
Is shut good and proper 
FOREVER 
All of the rumours 
Keeping me grounded 
I never said, I never said that they were 
Completely unfounded 
And all those lies 
Written lies, twisted lies 
Well, they weren't lies 
They weren't lies 
They weren't lies 
I never said 
I never said 
I could have mentioned your name 
I could have dragged you in 
Guilt by implication 
By association 
I've always been true to you 
In my own strange way 
I've always been true to you 
In my own sick way 
I'll always stay true to you

 

THE TEACHERS ARE AFRAID OF THE PUPILS

There's too many people 
Planning your downfall 
When your spirit's on trial 
These nights can be frightening 
Sleep transports sadness 
To some other mid-brain 
And somebody here 
Will not be here next year 
So you stand by the board 
Full of fear and intention 
And, if you think that they're listening 
Well, you've got to be joking 
Oh, you understand change 
And you think it's essential 
But when your profession 
Is humiliation 
Say the wrong word to our children ...
We'll have you, oh yes, we'll have you 
Lay a hand on our children 
And it's never too late to have you 
Mucus on your collar 
A nail up through the staff chair 
A blade in your soap 
And you cry into your pillow 
To be finished would be a relief 
To be finished would be a relief... 
Say the wrong word to our children ...
We'll have you, oh yes, we'll have you 
Lay a hand on our children 
And it's never too late to have you 
To be finished would be a relief 
To be finished would be a relief...
I'm very glad this thing has come 
Sometimes I'm so glad 
Never bother to play the tunes 
I've seen it coming for dear life

 

READER MEET AUTHOR

You don't know a thing about their lives 
They live where you wouldn't dare to drive
You shake as you think of how they sleep 
But you write as if you are my side-by-side 
Reader, meet Author 
With the hope of hearing sense 
But you may be feeling let down 
By the words of defence 
He says : "No-one ever sees me when I cry"
You don't know a thing about their lives 
Books don't save them, books aren't Stanley knives 
And if a fight broke out here tonight 
You'd be the first away, because you're that type 
And the Year 2000 won't change anyone here 
As each fabled promise flies so fast 
You'll swear it was never there 
Oh, have you ever escaped from a shipwrecked life ? 
So safely with your software; all miles from the front line 
You hear the way their sad voices, and you start to imagine things 
Oh, any excuse to write more lies

THE OPERATION

You fight with your right hand 
And caress with your left hand 
Everyone I know is sick to death of you 
With a tear that's a mile wide 
In the kite that you're flying 
Everyone I know is sick to death of you 
Ever since 
You don't look the same 
You're just not the same, no way 
You say clever things and 
You never used to 
You don't catch what I'm saying 
When you're deafened to advice 
Everyone here is sick to the 
Back teeth of you 
With a tear that's a mile wide 
In the kite that you're flying 
Everyone here is sick to the 
Tattoo of you 
Ever since 
You don't look the same 
You're just not the same, no way 
You say pleasant things and 
There is no need to
Still, you fight with your right hand 
And caress with your left hand 
Ooh, ooh ... Sad to say ... 
How once I was in love with you 
Sad to say ... 
You don't catch what I'm saying 
When you're deafened to advice 
Ooh, ooh ... Ever since 
You don't look the same 
You're just not the same, no way 
What the hell have 
They stuck into you ?

 

DAGENHAM DAVE

Head in the clouds, and a mouthful of pie 
Head in a blouse, everybody loves him 
I see why

DO YOUR BEST AND DON'T WORRY

Compare the best of their days 
With the worst of your days 
You won't win 
With your standards so high 
And your spirits so low 
At least remember ... 
This is you on a bad day, you on a pale day 
Just do your best and don't ... Don't worry, oh 
The way you hang yourself is oh, so unfair 
See the best of how they look 
Against the worst of how you are
And again, you won't win 
With your standards so high 
And your spirits so low 
At least remember ... 
This is you on a drab day, you in a drab dress 
Just do your best and don't ... Don't worry, oh 
The way you hang yourself is oh, so unfair 
Just do your best and don't ... Don't worry, oh 
The way you watch yourself is oh, so unfair 
Just do your best and don't ... Don't worry, oh 
Do your best and don't ...

SOUTHPAW

You were a boy before you became a man 
I don't see the joy 
And you ran with your pals in the sun 
You turned around and they were gone 
Again ... 
A sick boy should be treated 
So easily defeated 
Oh, I just don't understand 
So you ran with your pals in the sun 
You turned around 
You were alone 
Again ... 
And you ran back to Ma 
Which set the pace for the rest of your days 
Oh, you ran back to Ma 
Which set the pace for the rest of your days 
Oh, you ran back to Ma 
Which set the pace for the rest of your days 
And now, there is something that you should know 
There is something that you should know 
The girl of your dreams is 
Here all alone 
Girl of your dreams is 
Here all alone 
The girl of your dreams is 
Sad and all alone 
The girl of your dreams is 
Here all alone 
There is something that you should know 
There is something that you should know 
Girl of your dreams is 
Here all alone 
The girl of your dreams is 
Sad and is all alone 
The girl of your dreams is 
Sad and is feeling all alone 
Oh, there is something that you should know 
Help me, help me, help me ...

 

MALADJUSTED

I wanna start from 
Before the beginning 
Loot wine, "Be mine, and 
Then let's stay out for the night"
Ride via Parkside 
Semi-perilous lives 
Jeer the lights in the windows 
Of all safe and stable homes 
(But wondering then, well what 
Could peace of mind be like ?)
Anyway do you want to hear 
Our story, or not ? 
As the Fulham Road lights 
Stretch and invite into the night 
From a Stevenage overspill 
We'd kill to live around 
SW6 - with someone like you 
Keep thieves' hours 
With someone like you 
...As long as it slides 
You stalk the house 
In a low-cut blouse : 
"Oh Christ, another stifled 
Friday night !"
And the Fulham Road lights 
Stretch and invite into the night 
Well, I was fifteen 
What could I know ?
When the gulf between 
All the things I need 
And the things I receive 
Is an ancient ocean 
Wide, wild, lost, uncrossed 
Still I maintain there's nothing 
Wrong with you 
You do all that you do 
Because it's all you can do 
Well, I was fifteen 
Where could I go ?
With a soul full of loathing 
For stinging bureaucracy 
Making it anything 
Other than easy 
For working girls like me 
With my hands on my head 
I flop on your bed 
With a head full of dread 
For all I've ever said 
Maladjusted, maladjusted 
Maladjusted maladjusted 
Never to be trusted 
Oh, never to be trusted 
There's nothing wrong with you, oh 
...There's nothing wrong with you

 

ALMA MATTERS

So : the choice I have made 
May seem strange to you 
But who asked you, anyway ? 
It's my life to wreck 
My own way 
You see : to someone, somewhere, oh yeah ... 
Alma matters 
In mind, body and soul 
In part, and in whole 
Because to someone, somewhere, oh yeah ... 
Alma matters 
In mind, body and soul 
In part, and in whole 
So the life I have made 
May seem wrong to you 
But, I've never been surer 
It's my life to ruin 
My own way 
You see : to someone, somewhere, oh yeah ... 
Alma matters 
In mind, body and soul 
In part, and in whole 
Because to someone, somewhere, oh yeah ... 
Alma matters 
In mind, body and soul 
In part, and in whole 
To someone, somewhere, oh yeah ... 
Alma matters 
In mind, body and soul 
Part, and in whole 
So to someone, somewhere, oh yeah ... 
Alma matters 
In mind, body and soul 
Part, and in whole 
To someone, somewhere, oh yeah ... 
Oh yeah ... Oh yeah, oh yeah Oh yeah ...

 

AMBITIOUS OUTSIDERS

Bolt-lock your doors 
Alarm your cars 
And still we move in closer 
Every day 
Top of the list 
Is your smiling kids 
But we'll be smiling too 
So that's OK 
Oh, and by the way 
Thank you, because you're 
Giving, giving, giving 
And we're receiving - 
No, no, we're taking 
Keeping the population down 
Your taxes paid, but 
Police waylaid 
And we knows 
When the school bus 
Comes and goes 
We're on your street, but 
You don't see us 
Or, if you do 
You smile and say Hello 
BUT DON'T UNDERESTIMATE US 
When you are 
Giving, giving, giving 
And we're receiving - 
No, no, we're taking 
Just keeping 
The population down 
You're giving, giving, giving 
Well, it's your own fault 
For reproducing 
We're just keeping 
The population down

 

TROUBLE LOVES ME

Trouble loves me 
Trouble needs me 
Two things 
More than you do 
Or would attempt to 
So, console me 
Otherwise, hold me 
Just when it seems like 
Everything's evened out 
And the balance 
Seems serene 
Trouble loves me 
Walks beside me 
To chide me 
Not to guide me 
It's still much more 
Than you'll do 
So, console me 
Otherwise, hold me 
Just when it seems like 
Everything's evened out 
And the balance seems serene 
See the fool I'll be 
Still running 'round 
On the flesh rampage 
Still running 'round 
Ready with ready-wit 
Still running 'round 
On the flesh rampage 
- At your age ! 
Go to Soho, oh 
Go to waste in 
The wrong arms 
Still running 'round 
Trouble loves me 
Seeks and finds me 
To charlatanize me 
Which is only 
As it should be 
Oh, please fulfill me 
Otherwise, kill me 
Show me a barrel and watch me scrape it 
Faced with the music, as always I'll face it 
In the half-light 
So English, frowning 
Then at midnight I 
Can't get you out of my head 
A disenchanted taste 
Still running 'round 
A disenchanted taste 
Still running 'round

 

PAPA JACK

Papa Jack 
Wants to turn 
Back the clock 
And reach out 
To the kids 
He once had 
Who have flown 
Papa Jack 
In decline 
Feels inclined 
To reach out 
To the kids 
He once had 
Who have flown 
But there was a time 
When the kids reached up 
And Papa Jack just 
Pushed them away 
Looking deep 
In his heart 
Papa Jack 
Doesn't like 
What he sees 
Or the time 
On his hands 
The dying day 
The chilly sun 
Papa Jack 
All alone 
Sings slow 
Grieving and low 
But there was a time 
When the kids reached up 
Now you can't always 
Have it your way 
Papa Jack 
Ah ...

 

AMMUNITION

I know these roads 
Each ridge 
And narrow bridge 
Each cheveron 
Enticing me on 
Each warning sign 
I take in my stride 
I don't need more ammunition 
I've got more than I can spend 
I don't dwell on things I'm missing 
I'm just pleased 
With the things I've found 
I know these roads 
An old hand understands 
Above all, I know what's 
Expected of me now 
Veering cliffwards 
I don't need more ammunition 
I've got more than I can spend 
I don't dwell on things I'm missing 
I'm just pleased 
With the things I've found 
With the things I've found 
With the things I've found 
I've found 
I've been crying 
It comes back on these salient days 
And it stays 
And it says : 
"We've never really been away" 
I don't need more ammunition 
I've got more than I can spend 
I don't think of who I'm missing 
I've got no space and no time 
In my life, anymore 
No space or time 
In my life, anymore 
For Revenge

 

WIDE TO RECEIVE

Download something 
Useful, or useless 
Because I'm lying here 
Wide to receive 
Almost anything 
You'd care to give 
And I don't 
Get along with myself 
And I'm not too keen 
On anyone else 
Turn on, plug in 
Then just walk away 
Unlock, process 
And then just go 
And I've never felt quite so alone 
As I do right now 
I'm lying here 
Wide to receive 
Almost anything 
You'd care to leave 
Wide, wide, wide Wide, wide, wide...

 

ROY'S KEEN

(GO ON !)
He's romancing you 
And chancing his arm 
He'll be here 
Smiling on time 
He's romancing you 
And chancing his arm 
He'll be here 
Smiling on time 
Roy's keen oh Roy's keen 
Roy's keen oh Roy's keen 
We've never seen a 
Keener window-cleaner 
Back up the ladder 
Into each corner 
Dunking the chamois 
Just think of the goodwill 
The ladder's a planet 
Roy is a star, and 
I am a satellite 
(But that's alright) 
He can hold a smile for as long 
As you require (even longer) 
He can hold a smile for as long 
As you require (even longer) 
Roy's keen oh Roy's keen 
Roy's keen oh Roy's keen 
We've never seen a 
Keener window-cleaner 
Back up the ladder 
Into each corner 
Dunking the chamois 
Just think of the goodwill 
The ladder's a planet 
Roy is a star, and 
I am a satellite 
I will be set alight 
Don't say you'll hold it steady 
Then you let it go 
Don't say you'll hold it steady 
Then you let it go Oh ...
You're up the ladder 
Into each corner 
Foot in a bucket 
We trust you to wreck it 
Even when it's under your nose 
Well, you just can't 
See it, can you ? 
Well, it's here 
Right under your nose 
And you just can't 
See it, can you? La la la la ...
Roy's keen, Roy's keen La la la la ...
We've never seen a 
Keener window-cleaner 
Oh ... La la la la ...

 

HE CRIED

I need you 
Simple words 
But words which had never been heard 
By the soul 
Stoned to death 
But still living 
And so he froze where he stood 
And he looked to the ground 
And he cried 
He cried 
Ride our minds 
If you must 
But there's always a line you don't cross 
Time is short 
Don't be cruel 
Oh you don't know the power 
In what you're saying 
Oh ... 
And so he froze where he stood 
And he looked to the ground 
And he cried 
He cried 
People where 
I come from 
They survive without feelings or blood 
I never could 
Was stoned to death 
But I'm still living 
So he froze where he stood 
And he looked to the ground 
And he cried 
He cried 
So he froze 
And he looked, and he looked 
To the ground 
And he cried 
He cried

 

SORROW WILL COME IN THE END

Legalized theft 
Leaves me bereft 
I get it straight in the neck 
(Somehow expecting no less) 
A court of justice 
With no use for Truth 
Lawyer ...liar 
Lawyer ...liar 
You pleaded and squealed 
And you think you've won 
But Sorrow will come 
To you in the end 
And as sure as my words are pure 
I praise the day that brings you pain 
Q.C.'s obsessed with sleaze 
Frantic for Fame 
They're all on the game 
They just use a different name 
You lied 
And you were believed 
By a J.P. senile and vile 
You pleaded and squealed 
And you think you've won 
But Sorrow will come 
To you in the end 
And as sure as my words are pure 
I praise the day that brings you pain 
So don't close your eyes 
Don't close your eyes 
A man who slits throats 
Has time on his hands 
And I'm gonna get you 
So don't close your eyes 
Don't ever close your eyes 
You think you've won 
OH NO

 

SATAN REJECTED MY SOUL

Satan rejected my soul 
He knows my kind 
He won't be dragged down 
He's seen my face around 
He knows Heaven doesn't seem 
To be my home 
So I must find 
Somewhere else to go 
So I must find 
Somewhere else to go 
So, take it - please 
It's free 
You'll never see 
You'll never see 
All the fun in life it's cost me 
Satan rejected my soul 
As low as he goes 
He never quite goes this low 
He's seen my face around 
He knows Heaven doesn't seem 
To be my home 
So I must find 
Somewhere else to go 
So I must find 
Somewhere else to go 
So, take it please 
It's really sly 
Come on, come on, ah Come on, come on, come on 
Take it please, It's really sly 
Come on, come on, ah Come on, come on, come on 
Call me in, Pull me in, call me in 
Come on, come on, oh Come on, come on, come on 
Pull me in, pull me in, Call me in, haul me in, pull me in 
Come on, come on, ah, Come on, come on 
La la la la la, Oh ...

 
 REEL AROUND THE FOUNTAIN

It's time the tale was told
of how you took a child
and you made him old
Reel around the fountain
slap me on the patio
I'll take it now
Fifteen minutes with you
well, I wouldn't say no
people said that you were virtually dead
and they were so wrong
fifteen minutes with you
well, i wouldn't say no
people said that you were easily led
and they were half-right
I dreamt about you last night
and i fell out of bed twice
you can pin and mount me like a butterfly
but take me to the haven of your bed
was something that you never said
two lumps, please
you're the bee's knees
but so am I
Meet me at the fountain
shove me on the patio
I'll take it slowly
Fifteen minutes with you
oh I wouldn't say no
people see no worth in you
oh but I do

 

YOU'VE GOT EVERYTHING NOW

As merry as the days were long
I was right and you were wrong
back at the old grey school
I would win and you would lose
But you've got everything now
and what a terrible mess I've made of my life
No, I've never had a job
because I've never wanted one
I've seen you smile
but I've never really heard you laugh
So who is rich and who is poor?
I cannot say...
You are your mother's only son
and you're a desperate one
But I don't want a lover
I just want to be seen in the back of your car
A friendship sadly lost?
Well, this is true ...and yet, it's false
Did I ever tell you , by the way
I never did like your face
But you've got everything now
and what a terrible mess I've made of my life
No, I've never had a job
because I'm too shy
But I don't want a lover
I just want to be tied to the back of your car.

 

MISERABLE LIE

So, goodbye
please stay with your own kind
and I'll stay with mine
There's something against us
it's not time
So, goodbye
I know I hardly say
how much I love your casual way
but please put your tongue away
a little higher and we're well away
the dark nights are drawing in
and your humour is as black as them
I look at yours, you laugh at mine
and"love" is just a miserable lie
you have destroyed my flower like-life
not once-but twice
you have corrupt my innocent mind
not once-but twice
I know that wind-swept mystical air
it means: I'd like to see your underwear
I recognise that mystical air
it means: I'd like to see your underwear
what do we get for the trouble and pain?
just a rented room in Whalley Range
into the depths of the criminal world
I followed her...
I need advice, I need advice
because nobody ever looks at me twice
I'm just a country-mile behind
the world
I'm just a country mile behind
the whole world
so take me when you go

 

PRETTY GIRLS MAKE GRAVES

Upon the sand,upon the bay
"there is a quick and easy way" you say
before you illustrate
I'd rather state:
"I'm not the man you think I am
I'm not the man you think I am "
And Sorrow's native son
he will not smile for anyone
And pretty girls makes the graves
End of the pier, end of the bay
you tug my arm and say:"Give into lust,
give up to lust, oh heaven knows we'll
soon be dust..."
But I'm not the man you think I am
I'm not the man you think I am
And Sorrow's native son
he will not rise for anyone
And pretty girls make graves
I could have been wild and I could have been free
but Nature played this trick on me
She wants it Now
and she will not wait
but she's too rough
and I'm too delicate
Then on the sand
another man, he takes her hand
and a smile lights up her stupid face
(and well, it would)
I lost my faith in Womanhood
I lost my faith in Womanhood, I lost my faith

 

THE HAND THAT ROCKS THE CRADLE

Please don't cry
the ghost and the storm outside
will not invade this sacred shire
nor infiltrate your mind
my life down I shall lie
if the bogey-man should try
to play tricks on your sacred mind
to tease, torment and tantalise
wavering shadows loom
a piano plays in an empty room
there'll be blood on the cleaver tonight
when darkness lifts and the room is bright
I'll still be by your side
for you are all that matters
and I'll love you till the day I die
there never need to be longing in your eyes
as long as the hand that rocks the cradle is mine
ceiling shadows shimmy by
and when the wardrobe towers like a beast of prey
there's a sadness in your beautiful eyes
you're untouched, unsoiled, wonderous eyes
my life down I shall lie
should restless spirts try
to play tricks on you sacred mind
but whom I never gave a name
I just looked into his wonderous eyes
and said" never never never again"
all too soon I did return
just like a moth to a flame
so rattle my bones all over the stones
because I'm only a beggar-man whom nobody owns
see how words as old as sin
fit me like a glove I'm here and here I'll stay
together we lie, together we pray
there never need be longing in your eyes
as long as the hand that rocks the cradle is mine

 

STILL ILL

I decree today that life
is simply taking and not giving
England is mine and it owes me a living
ask me why, and I'll spit in your eye
ask me why, and I'll spit in your eye
but we cannot cling to the old dreams anymore
no, we cannot cling to the old dreams anymore
Does the body rule the mind
or does the mind rule the body?
I dunno...
Under the iron bridge we kissed
and although I ended up with sore lips
it just wasn't like the old days anymore
no, it wasn't like those days
am I still ill?
Does the body rule the mind
or does the mind rule the body ?
I dunno...
Ask me why, and I'll die
ask me why, and I'll die
and if you must go to work tomorrow
well, if I were you I wouldn't bother
for there are brighter sides to life
and I should know because I've seen them
but not very often...
under the iron bridge we kissed
and although I ended up with sore lips
it just wasn't like the old days anymore
no, it wasn't like those days
am I still ill?

 

HAND IN GLOVE

Hand in glove
the sun shines out of our behinds
no, it's not like any other love
this one is different-because it's us
Hand in glove
we can go wherever we please
and everything depends upon
how near you stand to me
And if the people stare
then the people stare
I really don't know and I really don't care
Hand in glove
the Good People laugh
yes, we may be hidden by rags
but we have something they'll never have
So, hand in glove I stake my claim
I'll fight to the last breath
If they dare touch a hair on your head
I'll fight to the last breath
The Good Life is out there, somewhere
so stay on my arm, you little charmer
But I know my luck too well
and I'll probably never see you again.

 

WHAT DIFFERENCE DOES IT MAKE?

All men have secrets and here is mine
so let it be known
we have been through hell and high tide,
I can surely rely on you?
and yet you start to recoil,
heavy words are so lightly thrown
but still I'd leap in front of a flying bullet for you
So, what difference does it make?
so, what difference does it make?
it makes none
but you have gone
and you must be looking very old tonight
The devil will find work for idle hands to do
I stole and I lied, and why?
because you asked me to!
but now you make feel so ashamed
because I've only got two hands
well, I'm still fond of you
So, what difference does it make?
so, what difference does it make?
it makes none
but you have gone
and your prejudice won't keep you warm tonight
So, no more apologies
no more apologies
I'm too tired
I'm too sick and tired
and I'm feeling very sick and ill today
But I'm still fond of you

 

I DON'T OWE YOU ANYTHING

Bought on stolen wine
a nod was the first step
you know very well
what was coming next
did I really walk all this way
just to hear you say
"oh I don't want to go out tonight"
but you will
for you must
I don't owe you anything
but you owe me something
repay me now
you should never go to them
let them come to you
just like I do
you should not go to them
let them come to you
just like I do
Too freely on your lips
words prematurely said
oh but I know what will make you smile tonight
Life is never kind
life is never kind
oh but I know what will make you smile tonight

 

SUFFER LITTLE CHILDREN

Over the moors,take me to the moors
dig a shallow grave
and I'll lay me down
Lesley-Anne, with your pretty white beads
oh John, you'll never be a man
and you'll never see your home again
oh Manchester, so much to answer for
Edward, see those alluring lights?
tonight will be your very last night
a woman said "I know my son is dead
I'll never rest my hands on his scared head"
Hindley wakes and Hindley says:
"Wherever he has gone, I have gone "
But fresh lilaced moorland fields
cannot hide the stoild stench of death
Hindley wakes and Hindley says:
"Whatever he has done, I have done"
But this is no easy ride
for a child cries
"find me...find me, nothing more
we're on a sullen misty moor
we may be dead and we may be gone
but we will be right by your side
until the day you die
this is no easy ride
we will haunt you when you laugh
yes, you could say we're a team
you might sleep
BUT YOU WILL NEVER DREAM!"
Oh Manchester, so much to answer for
Oh Manchester, so much to answer for
Over the moor, I'm on the moor
the child is on the moor

 

THE HEADMASTER RITUAL

Belligerent ghouls

and he grabs and devours
I wanna go home
I don't want to stay

 

RUSHOLME RUFFIANS

The last night at the fair
by the big wheel generator
a boy is stabbed
and his money is grabbed
and the air hangs heavy like a dulling wine
she is famous
she is funny
an engagement ring
doesn't mean a thing
to a mind consumed by brass(money)
and though I walk home alone
my faith in love is still devout
the last night at the fair
from a seat on a whirling waltzer
her skirt ascends for a watching eye
it's a hideous trait( on her mother's side)
and though I walk home alone
my faith in love is still devout
then someone falls in love
and someone's beaten up
and the senses being dulled are mine
and someone falls in love
someone's beaten up
and the senses being dulled are mine
and though I walk home alone
my faith in love is still devout
this is the last night of the fair
and the grease in the hair
of a speedway operator
is all a tremulous heart requires
a schoolgirl is denied
she said "How quickly would I die
if I jumped from the top of the parachutes?"
this is the last night of the fair
and the grease in the hair
of a speedway operator
is all a tremulous heart requires
a schoolgirl is denied
she said "How quickly would I die
if I jumped from the top of the parachutes?"
scratch my name on your arm with a fountain pen
(this means you really love me)
scratch my name on your arm with a fountain pen
(this means you really love me)
and though I walk home alone
my faith in love is still devout

 

I WANT THE ONE I CAN'T HAVE

On the day that your mentality
catches up with your biology
I want the one I can't have
and it's driving me mad
it's written all over my face
A double-bed
and a stalwart lover, for sure
these are the riches of the poor
A double-bed
and a stalwart lover, for sure
these are the riches of the poor
a tough kid who sometimes swallows nails
raised on Prisoner's Aid
he killed a policeman when he was thirteen
and somehow that really impressed me
it's written all over my face
On the day that your mentality
catches up with your biology
And if you ever need self-validation
just meet me in the alley by the
railway-station
it's written all over my face

 

WHAT SHE SAID

What she said:
"How come someone hasn't noticed
that I'm dead
and decided to bury me
God knows, I'm ready"
What she said was
but then, all the rejection she's had
to pretend to be happy
could only be idiocy
What she said was not for the job or
lover that she never had
What she read
all heady books
she'd sit and prophesise
(it took a tattoed boy from Birkenhead
to really really open her eyes)
What she read

THAT JOKE ISN'T FUNNY ANYMORE

Park the car at the side of the road
you should know
time's tide will smother you
and I will too
when you laugh about other people who feel so
very lonely
their only desire is to die
well I'm afraid
it doesn't make me smile
I wish I could laugh
but that joke isn't funny anymore
it's too close to home and it's too near the bone
it's too close to home and it's too near the bone
more than you'll ever know
It was dark as I drove the point home
and on cold leather seats
well, it suddenly struck me
I just might die with a smile on my
face after all
I've seen this happen in other people's lives
and now it's happening in mine

 

NOWHERE FAST

I'd like to drop my trousers to the world
I am a man of means(of slender means)
each household appliance
is like a new science in my town
and if a day came when I felt a natural emotion
I'd get such a shock I'd probably jump in the ocean
and when a train goes by
it's such a sad sound
I'd like to drop my trousers to the Queen
every sensible child will know what this means
the poor and the needy
are selfish and greedy on her terms
and if the day came when I felt a natural emotion
I'd get such a shock I'd probably jump in the ocean
and when a train goes by
it's such a sad song
And when I'm lying in my bed
I think about life
and I think about death
and neither one particularly appeals to me
and if the day came when I felt a natural emotion
I'd get such a shock I'd probably lie
in the middle of the street and die
I'd lie down and die

 

WELL I WONDER

Well I wonder
do you hear me when you sleep?
I hoarsely cry
Well I wonder
do you see me when we pass?
I half-die
Please keep me in mind
please keep me in mind
Gasping-but somehow still alive
this is the fierce last stand of all I am
Gasping-dying-but somehow still alive
this is the final stand of all I am
Please keep me in mind

 

BARBARISM BEGINS AT HOME

Unruly boys
who will not grow up
must be taken in hand
Unruly girls
who will not settle down
they must be taken in hand
A crack on the head
is what you get for not asking
and a crack on the head
is what you get for asking

 

MEAT IS MURDER

Heifer whines could be human cries
closer comes the screaming knife
this beautiful creature must die
this beautiful creature must die
a death for no reason
and death for reason is MURDER
and the flesh you so fancifully fry
is not succulent, tasty or nice
it's death for no reason
and death for no reason is MURDER
and the calf that you carve with a smile
is MURDER
and the turkey you festively slice
is MURDER
do you know how animals die?
kitchen aroma aren't very homely
it's not "comforting," "cheery" or kind
it's sizzling blood and the unholy stench
of MURDER
it's not "natural," "normal" or kind
the fleas you so fancifully fry
as you savour the flavour
of MURDER
NO, NO, NO, IT'S MURDER
NO, NO, NO, IT'S MURDER
who hears when animals cry?

 

THE QUEEN IS DEAD

Farewell to this lands cheerless marches
hemmed in like a boar between arches
her very Lowness with her head in a sling
Im truely sorry-but it sounds like a wonderful thing
dear Charles, dont you ever crave
to appear on the front of the Daily mail
dressed in your Mother's bridal veil?
So, I checked all the registered historical facts
and I was shocked into shame to discover
how Im the 18th pale descendent
of some, old queen or other
has the world changed, or have I changed?
has the world changed, or have I changed?
as some 9-year old tough peddles drugs
(I never even knew what drugs were)
And so, I broke into the Palace
with a sponge and a rusty spanner
she said: "Eh, I know you, and you cannot sing"
I said: "that's nothing -you should hear me play piano"
We can go for a walk where it's quiet and dry
and we can talk about precious things
but when you are tied to your mother's apron
not one talks about castration
We can go for a walk where it's quiet and dry
and we can talk about precious things
like love and law and poverty
these are the things that kill me
We can go for a walk where it's quiet and dry
and we can talk about precious things
but the rain that flattens my hair
theses are the things that kill me
Passed the Pub that saps your body
and the church who'll snatch your money
the Queen is dead, boys
and it's so lonely on a limb
Pass the Pub that wrecks your body
and the church-all they want is your money
the Queen is dead, boys`
you can trust me, boys
life is very long, when you're lonely
life is very long, when you're lonely...

 

FRANKLY MR.SHANKLY

Frankly, Mr Shankly, this position Ive held
it pays my way, but it corrodes my soul
I want to leave you will not miss me
I want to go down in musical history
Frankly, Mr Shankly, Im a sickening wreck
Ive got the 21st Century breathing down my neck
I must move fast, you understand me
I want to go down in celluloid history
Fame, Fame, fatal Fame
it can play hideous tricks on the brain
but still I rather be Famous
than righteous or holy, any day
but sometimes Id feel more fulfilled
making Christmas cards with the mentally ill
I want to Live and I want to Love
I want to catch something that I might be ashamed of
Frankly, Mr Shankly, this position I've held
it pays my way and it corrodes my soul
oh, I didnt realise that you wrote poetry
(I didnt realise you wrote such bloody awful poetry)
Frankly, Mr Shankly, since you ask
you are a flatulent pain the arse
I do not mean to be so rude
but still, I must speck frankly, Mr Shankly

 

I KNOW IT'S ALL OVER

Oh Mother, I can fell the soil falling over my head
and as i climb into an empty bed
Oh well, Enough said
I know it's over-still I cling
I don't know where else I can go
Oh Mother, I can feel the soil falling over my head
see, the sea want s to take me
the knife wants to cut me
do you think you can help me?
Sad veiled bride, please be happy
handsome groom, give her room
loud, loutish lover, treat her kindly
(although she needs you
more than she loves you)
and I know it's over
and it never really began
but in my heart it was so real
and you even spoke to me and said:
"If you're so funny
then why are you on your own tonight?
and if you are so clever
then why are you on your own tonight?
if you're so terribly good looking
then why do you sleep alone tonight?
because tonight is just like any other night
that's why you're on your own tonight
with your triumphs and your charms
while they are in each other's arms.."
It's so easy to laugh
it's so easy to hate
it takes strength to be gentle and kind
It's so easy to laugh
it's so easy to hate
it takes guts to be gentle and kind
love is Natural and Real
but not for you, my love
not tonight my love
love is Natural and Real
but not for such as you and I, my love
Oh Mother, I can fell the soil falling over my head
Oh Mother, I can fell the soil falling over my head...

 

NEVER HAD NO ONE EVER

When you walk without ease
on these
the very streets where you were raised
I had a really bad dream
it lasted 20 years, 7 months, and 27 days
Never had no one ever.

 

CEMETERY GATES

A dreaded sunny day
so I meet you at the cemetry gates
Keats and Yeats are on your side
A dreaded sunny day
so I meet you at the cemetry gates
Keats and Yeats are on your side
while Wilde is on mine
So we go inside and we gravely read the stones
all those people all those lives
where are they now ?
with loves, and hates
and passions just like mine
they were born
and then they lived and then they died
which seems so unfair
and I wantr to crv
You say: "ere thrice the sun hath done salutation to the dawn"
and you claim these words as your own
but Im well-read, have heard them said
a hundred times (maybe less, maybe more)
if you must write prose/poems
the words you use should be your own
dont plagiarise or take "on loans"
there's alweays someone, somewhere
with a big nose, who knows
and who trips you up and laughs
when you fall
You say: "ere long done do does did "
words which could only be your own
you then produce the text
from whence was ripped
(some dizzy whore, 1804)
A dreaded sunny day
so let's go where we're happy
so I meet you at the cemetry gates
Keats and Yeats are on your side
A dreaded sunny day
so let's go where we're wanted
so I meet you at the cemetry gates
Keats and Yeats are on your side
but you lose
because Wilde is on mine

 

BIGMOUTH STRIKES AGAIN

Sweetness, sweetness I was only joking
when I said Id like to smash every tooth
in your head
Sweetness, sweetness I was only joking
when I said by right s you should be
bludgeoned in your bed
and now I know how Joan of Arc felt
now I know how Joan of Arc felt
as the flames roseto her roman nose
and her Walkman stared to melt
Bibmouth, bigmouth
bigmouth strikes again
and Ive got no right to take my place
with the Human race
and now I know how Joan of Arc felt
now I know of Joan of Arc felt
as the flames rose to her roman nose
and her hearing aid started to melt
Bigmouth, bigmouth
bigmouth strikes again
and Ive got no right to take my place
with the Human race

 

THE BOY WITH A THORN IN HIS SIDE

The boy with the thorn in his side
behind the hatred there lies
a murderous desire for love
how can they look into my eyes
and still they dont believe me
how can they hear me say those words
and still they dont believe me
and if they don't believe me now
will they ever believe me?
and if they don't believe me now
will they ever believe me?
The boy with the thorn in his side
behind the hatred there lies
a plundering desire for love
how can they see the Love in our eyes
and still they don't believe us
and after all this time
they don't want to believe us
and if they dont believe us now
will they ever believe us ?
andd when you want to Live
how do you start ?
where do you go ?
who do you know?

 

VICAR IN A TUTU

I was minding mind business
lifting some lead off
the roof of the Holy Name church
it was worthwhile living a laughable life
just to set my eyes on a blistering sight
of a vicar in a tu-tu
he's not strange
he just wants to live his life this way
a scanty bit of a thing
with a decorative ring
that wouldn't cover the head of a child
as Rose collects the money in the cannister
who comes sliding down the bannister
the vicar in a tu-tu
he's not strange
he just wants to live his life this way
the monkish monsignor
with a head full of plaster
said "my man, get your vile soul dry-cleaned"
as Rose counts the money in the cannister
as natural as rain
he dances again
vicar in a tu-tu
The next day in the pulpit
with Freedom and Ease
combating ignoranca,dust and disease
as Rose counts the money in the cannister
as natural as rain
he dances again
the fabric of a tu-tu
any man could get us to
and I am a living sign.

 

THERE IS A LIGHT THAT NEVER GOES OUT

Take me out tonight
where there's music and there's people
who are young and alive
driving in your car
I never never want to go home
because I havent got one
anymore
take me out tonight
because I want to see people and I
want to see lights
driving in your car
oh please dont drop me home
because it's not my home, it's their
home, and Im welcome no morw
and if a double-decker bus
crashes in to us
to die by your side
such a heavenly way to die
and if a ten ton truck
kills the both of us
to die by your side
the pleasure and the privilege is mine
take me out tonight
oh take me anywhere, I dont care
and in the darken underpass
I thought Oh God, my chance has come at last
(but then a strange fear gripped me and I just couldn't ask)
take me out tonight
take me anywhere, I dont care
just driving in your car
I never never want to go home
because I havent got one
I havent got one.

 

SOME GIRLS ARE BIGGER THAN OTHERS

From the ice-age to the dole-age
there is but one concern
and I have just discover
some girls are bigger than others
some girls are bigger than others
some girls mothers are bigger than
other girls mothers
As Anthony said to Cleopatra
as he opened a crate of ale:
some girls are bigger than others
some girls are bigger than others
some girls mothers are bigger than
other girls mothers.

 

A RUSH AND A PUSH AND AND THE LAND IS OURS

HELLO
I am the ghost of Troubled Joe
hung by his pretty white neck
some eighteen months ago
I travelled to a mystical time zone
but I missed my bed
so I soon came home
they said:
"there's too much caffeine
in your bloodstream
and a lack of real spice
in your life"
I said:
"leave me alone
because I'm alright, dad
just surprised to still
be on my own...."
Ooh, but don't mention love
I'd hate the real strain of the pain again
a rush and a push and the land that
we stand on is ours
it has been before
so it shall be again
and people who are uglier than you and I
they take what they need, and leave
Ooh, but don't mention love
I'd hate the pain and the strain all over again
a rush and a push and the land that
we stand on is ours
it has been before
so why can't it be now?
and people who are weaker than you and I
they take what they want from life
Ooh, but don't mention love
no - just don't mention love!
a rush and a push and the land that
we stand on is ours
your youth may be gone
but you're still a young man
so phone me, phone me, phone me
so phone me, phone me, phone me
Ooh, I think I'm in love...
Urrgh, I think I'm in lerv

 

I STARTED SOMETHING I COULDN'T FINISH

The lanes were silent
with nothing or no one around for miles
I doused our friendly venture
with a hard-faced
three-word gesture
I started something
I forced you into a zone
and you were clearly
never meant to go
hair brushed and parted
typical me, typical me, typical me
I started something
...and now I'm not too sure
I grabbed you by the guilded beams
that's what Tradition means
and I doused another venture
with a gesture
that was...absolutely vile
I started something
forced you to a zone
and you were clearly
never meant to go
hair brushed and parted
typical me, typical me, typical me
I started something
...and now I'm not too sure
I grabbed you by the guilded beams
that's what Tradition means
and now eighteen months' hard-labour
seems...fair enough
I started something
forced you to a zone
and you were clearly
never meant to go
hair brushed and parted
typical me, typical me, typical me
I started something
and now I'm not too sure

 

DEATH OF A DISCO DANCER

The death of a disco dancer
well, it happens a lot 'round here
and if you think Peace
is a common goal
well, that goes to show
just how little you know
The death of a disco dancer
well, I'd rather not get involved
I never talk to my neighbour
I'd just rather not get involved
Love, peace and harmony?
Love, peace and harmony?
Oh, very nice, very nice, very nice, very nice
...but maybe in the next world.

 

GIRLFRIEND IN A COMA

Girlfriend in a coma, I know
I know - it's serious
Girlfriend in a coma, I know
I know - it's really serious
there wree times when I could
have 'murdered' her
(but, you know, I would hate
anything to happen to her)
NO, I DON'T WANT TO SEE HER
Do you really think
she'll pull through?
Do you really think
she'll pull through?
Girlfriend in a coma, I know
I know, it's serious
there were time when I could
have 'strangeled' her
(but, you know, I would hate
anything to happen to her)
WOULD YOU PLEASE LET ME SEE HER!
Do you really think she'll pull through?
Do you really think she'll pull through?
Let me wisper my last goodbyes
I know - IT'S SERIOUS

 

STOP ME IF YOU'VE HEARD THIS ONE BEFORE

Stop me, stop me,
stop me if you think that you've heard this one before
stop me, stop me
stop me if you think that you've heard this one before
nothing's changed
I still love you, oh I still love you
...only slightly less than I used to
I was delayed, I was way-laid
an emergency stop
I smelt the last ten seconds of life
I crashed down on the crossbar
and the pain was enough to make
a shy, bald buddhist reflect
and plan a mass-murder
who said I'd lied to her?
who said I'd lied because I never
who said I'd lied because I never
I was detained, I was restrained
he broke my spleen
he broke my knees
(and then he really laid into me)
Friday night in Out-patients
who said I'd lied to her?
who said I'd lied - because I never
who said I'd lied - because I never
Oh, so I drank one
or was it four
and when I fell on the floor
...I drank more
stop me, stop me
stop me if you think that you've heard this one before
nothing's changed
I still love you, I still love you
but only slightly
less than I used to

 

LAST NIGHT I DREAMT THAT SOMEBODY LOVED ME

Last night I dreamt
that somebody loved me
no hope - but no harm
just another false alarm
Las night I felt
real arms around me
no hope - no harm
just another false alarm
so, tell me how long
before the last one?
and tell me how long
before the right one?
this story is old - I KNOW
but it goes on
this story is old - I KNOW
but it goes on

 

UNHAPPY BIRTHDAY

I've come to wish you an unhappy birthday
I've come to wish you an unhappy birthday
because you're evil
and you lie
and if you should die
I may feel slightly sad
(but I won't cry)
Loved and lost
and some may say
when usually its Nothing
surely you're happy
it should be this way?
I say "No, I'm gonna kill my dog"
and: "May the lines sag heavy
and deep tonight XXX"
I've come to wish you an unhappy birthday
I've come to wish you an unhappy birthday
because you're evil
and you lie
and if you should die
I may feel slightly sad
(But I won't cry)
Loved and lost
some people say
when usually its Nothing
surely you're happy
it should be this way?
I said "No"
and then I shot myself
so, drink, drink, drink
and be ill tonight
from the one you left behind
from the one you left behind...

 

PAINT A VULGAR PICTURE

At the record company meeting
On their hands - a dead star
and ooh, the plans that they weave
and ooh, the sikening greed
At the record company meeting
on their hands - a dead star
the sycophantic slags all say:
"I knew him first, and I knew him well"
Re-issue! Re-package! Re-package!
Re-evaluate the songs
double-pack with a photograph
Extra Track (and a tacky badge)
A-list, playlist
"Please them, please them!"
"Please them! Please them!"
(sadly, THIS was your life)
but you could have said no
if you'd wanted to
you could have said no
if you'd wanted to
BPI, MTV, BBC
"Please them! Please them!"
(sadly this was your life)
but you could have said no
if you'd wanted to
you could have walked away
...couldn't you?
I touched you at the soundcheck
you had no real way of knowing
in my heart I bgged "please, take
me with you...
I don't care where you're going"
But to you I was faceless
I was fawning, I was boring
just a child from those ugly new houses
who could never begin to know
who could never really know
Best of? Most of?
Satiate the need
slip them into different sleeves!
Buy both, and be decieved
climber - new entry, re-entry
World tour! ("media whore")
"Please the Press in Belgium!"
(THIS was your life...)
and when it fails to recoup?
Well, maybe:
You just haven't earned it yet, baby
I walked a pace behind you at the soundcheck
you're just the same as I am
what makes most people feel happy
leads us headlong into harm
so, in my bedroom in those 'ugly new houses'
I dance my legs down to the knees
but me and my 'true love'
we will never meet again...
At the record company meeting
on their hands - at last! - a dead star!
but they cannot taint you in my eyes
no, they cannout touch you now
No, they cannot hurt you my darling
they cannot touch you now
but me and my 'true love'
will never meet again

 

DEATH AT ONE'S ELBOW

Ooh Glenn, don't come to the house tonight
Ooh, Glenn, don't come to the house tonight
because there's somebody here
who really really loves you
stay home
be bored
(it's crap, I KNOW)
Ooh, Glenn, don't come to the house tonight
Ooh, Glen, don't come to the house tonight
because there's somebody here
who'll take a hatchet to your ear
how the frustration renders me
hateful, Glenn!
don't come to the house tonight
don't come to the house tonight
because you'll slip on the
trail of my bespattered remains
and so, that's why
GOODBYE MY LOVE, GOODBYE MY LOVE, GOODBYE MY LOVE...
Belch

 

I WON'T SHARE YOU

I won't share you
I won't share you
with the drive and ambition
and the zeal I feel
this is my time
as the note I wrote
was read, she said
has the Perrier gone
straight to my head
or is life plainly sick and cruel, instead?
"YES!"
No-no-no-no-no-no
I won't share you
I won't share you
with the drive and the dreams inside
this is my time
Life tends to come and go
well, that's OK
just as long as you know
Life tends to come and go
well, that's OK
just as long as you know
I won't share you
I won't share you
with the drive and the dreams inside
this is my time, this is my time

PANIC

Panic on the streets of London
Panic on the streets of Birmingham
I wonder to myself
Could life ever be sane again
on the Leeds side-streets that you slip down
I wonder to myself
Hopes may rise on the Grasmeres
But Honey Pie, you're not safe here
So you run down
To the safety of the town
But there's Panic on the streets of Carlisle
Dublin, Dundee, Humberside
I wonder to myself
Burn down the Disco
Hang the blessed D.J.
Because the music that they constantly play
IT SAYS NOTHING TO ME ABOUT MY LIFE
Hang the blessed D.J.
Because the music they constantly play
On the Leeds side-streets that you slip down
On the provincial towns that you jog 'round
Hang the D.J.,. Hang the D.J.,.Hang the D.J...

ASK

Shyness is nice, but
Shyness can stop you
From doing all the things in life
That you'd like to
So, if there's something you'd like to try
ASK ME-I WON'T SAY "NO"-HOW COULD I?
Coyness is nice, but ,
Coyness can stop you
from saying all the things in
life that you want to
If there's something that you'd like to try
ASK ME-I WON'TSAY"NO"-HOW COULD I?
Spending warm, Summer days indoors
Writing fringhtening verse
To a buck-toothed girl in Luxembourg
ASK ME, ASK ME ,ASK ME, ASK ME, ASK ME ,ASK ME
Because if it's not Love
Then it's the Bomb
That will bring us together
Nature is a language-can't you read?
Nature is a language-can't you read?
ASK ME, ASK ME ,ASK ME, ASK ME, ASK ME ,ASK ME
Because if it's not Love
Then it's the Bomb
That will bring us together

 

MARIE'S THE NAME (HIS LATEST FLAME) / RUSHOLME RUFFIANS

Very old friend 
Came by today 
As he was telling everyone in town 
Of all the love that he'd just found 
And Marie's the name (of his latest flame) 
Talked and talked 
And I heard him say 
That she had the longest blackest hair 
Prettiest green eyes anywhere 
And Marie's the name (of his latest flame) 
The last night of the fair 
By the big wheel generator 
A boy is stabbed 
His money is grabbed 
And the air hangs heavy like a dulling wine 
She is Famous 
She is Funny 
An engagement ring 
Doesn't mean a thing 
To a mind consumed by brass (money), oh 
The last night of the fair 
From a seat on a whirling waltzer 
Her skirt ascends for a watching eye 
It's a hideous trait (on her mother's side)
From a seat on a whirling waltzer 
Her skirt ascends for a watching eye 
A hideous trait (on her mother's side) 
Then someone falls in love 
Someone's beaten up 
Someone's beaten up 
And the senses being dulled are mine 
And someone falls in love 
Someone's beaten up 
And the senses being dulled are mine 
This is the last night of the fair 
And the grease in the hair 
Of a speedway operator 
Is all a tremulous heart requires 
A schoolgirl is denied 
She said : "How quickly would I die 
If I jumped from the top of the parachutes ?"
This is the last night of the fair 
And the grease in the hair 
Of a speedway operator 
Is all a tremulous heart requires 
A schoolgirl is denied 
She said : "How quickly would I die 
Oh, if I jumped from the top of the parachutes ?"
...Oh, walk home alone 
I might walk home alone 
But my faith in love is still devout

 

THE BOY WITH THE THORN IN HIS SIDE

The boy with the thorn in his side
behind the hatred there lies
a murderous desire for love
how can they look into my eyes
and still they dont believe me
how can they hear me say those words
and still they dont believe me
and if they don't believe me now
will they ever believe me?
and if they don't believe me now
will they ever believe me?
The boy with the thorn in his side
behind the hatred there lies
a plundering desire for love
how can they see the Love in our eyes
and still they don't believe us
and after all this time
they don't want to believe us
and if they dont believe us now
will they ever believe us ?
andd when you want to Live
how do you start ?
where do you go ?
who do you know?

 

RUBBER RING / WHAT SHE SAID

Yeah! What she says : 
"How come someone hasn't noticed 
That I'm dead 
And decided to bury me ? 
God knows, I'm ready !"
La-la-la ... 
What she said was sad 
But then, all the rejection she's had 
To pretend to be happy 
Could only be idiocy 
La-la-la ... 
What she said was not for the job or 
Lover that she never had 
No no no ... 
What she read 
All heady books 
She'd sit and prophesise 
(It took a tattooed boy from 
Birkenhead 
To really really open her eyes)
What she read 
All heady books 
She'd sit and prophesise 
(It took a tattooed boy from 
Birkenhead 
To really really open her eyes)
What she said : 
"I smoke because I'm hoping for an 
Early death 
AND I NEED TO CLING TO SOMETHING !"
What she said : 
"I smoke because I'm hoping for an 
Early death 
AND I NEED TO CLING TO SOMETHING !"
No no no no ...

 

IS IT REALLY SO STRANGE?

I left the North 
I travelled South 
I found a tiny house 
And I can't help the way I feel 
Oh yes, you can kick me 
And you can punch me 
And you can break my face 
But you won't change the way I feel 
'Cause I love you, Oh ... 
And is it really so strange ? 
Oh, is it really so strange ? 
Oh, is it really so, really so strange ? 
I say NO, you say YES 
(and you will change your mind) 
I left the South 
I travelled North 
I got confused - I killed a horse 
I can't help the way I feel 
Oh yes, you can punch me 
And you can butt me 
And you can break my spine 
But you won't change the way I feel 
'Cause I love you, Oh ... 
And is it really so strange ? 
Oh, is it really so strange ? 
Oh, is it really so, really so strange ? 
I say NO, you say YES 
(But you will change your mind) 
I left the North again 
I travelled South again 
And I got confused - I killed a nun 
I CAN'T HELP THE WAY I FEEL 
(I lost my bag in Newport Pagnell) 
Why is the last mile the hardest mile ? 
My throat was dry, with the sun in my eyes 
And I realised, I realised 
I could never 
I could never, never, never, go back home again

 

CEMETERY GATES

A dreaded sunny day
so I meet you at the cemetry gates
Keats and Yeats are on your side
A dreaded sunny day
so I meet you at the cemetry gates
Keats and Yeats are on your side
while Wilde is on mine
So we go inside and we gravely read the stones
all those people all those lives
where are they now ?
with loves, and hates
and passions just like mine
they were born
and then they lived and then they died
which seems so unfair
and I wantr to crv
You say: "ere thrice the sun hath done salutation to the dawn"
and you claim these words as your own
but Im well-read, have heard them said
a hundred times (maybe less, maybe more)
if you must write prose/poems
the words you use should be your own
dont plagiarise or take "on loans"
there's alweays someone, somewhere
with a big nose, who knows
and who trips you up and laughs
when you fall
You say: "ere long done do does did "
words which could only be your own
you then produce the text
from whence was ripped
(some dizzy whore, 1804)
A dreaded sunny day
so let's go where we're happy
so I meet you at the cemetry gates
Keats and Yeats are on your side
A dreaded sunny day
so let's go where we're wanted
so I meet you at the cemetry gates
Keats and Yeats are on your side
but you lose
because Wilde is on mine

 

LONDON

Smoke
Lingers 'round your fingers
Train
Heave on - to Euston
Do you think you've made
The right decision this time?
You left
Your tired family grieving
And you think they're sad because you're leaving
But didn't you see the Jealousy in the eyes
Of the ones who had to stay behind?
And do you think you've made
The right decision thins time?
You left
Your girlfriend on the platform
With thei really ragged notion that you'll return
But she knows
That when he goes
He really goes
So do you think you've made
The right decision this time?

 

I KNOW IT'S OVER

I can feel the soil falling over my head 
And as I climb into an empty bed 
Oh well. Enough said. 
I know it's over - still I cling 
I don't know where else I can go 
Over ... 
Oh Mother, I can feel the soil falling over my head 
See, the sea wants to take me 
The knife wants to cut me 
Do you think you can help me ? 
Sad veiled bride, please be happy 
Handsome groom, give her room 
Loud, loutish lover, treat her kindly 
(Though she needs you 
More than she loves you) 
And I know it's over - still I cling 
I don't know where else I can go 
Over, it's over, it's over, it's over 
It's over, la ... 
I know it's over 
And it never really began 
But in my heart it was so real
And you even spoke to me, and said : 
"If you're so funny 
Then why are you on your own tonight ? 
And if you're so clever 
Then why are you on your own tonight ? 
I know ... 
'Cause tonight - it's just like any other night 
That's why you're on your own tonight 
Your triumphs and your charms 
While they're in each other's arms..."
It's so easy to laugh 
It's so easy to hate 
It takes strength to be gentle and kind 
Over, over, over, over 
It's so easy to laugh 
It's so easy to hate 
It takes guts to be gentle and kind 
Over, over 
Love is Natural and Real 
But not for you, my love 
Not tonight, my love 
Love is Natural and Real 
But not for such as you and I, my love 
Oh Mother, I can feel the soil falling over my head...
Oh Mother, I can feel the soil fall over, fall over my head 
Oh Mother, I can feel the ... fall over my ... , Oh ...

 

THE DRAIZE TRAIN

A vastly superior version of the instrumental B-side, acting as a peace 
offering to Marr (Morrissey chose the tracks for the compilation, 
and of course, receives no royalties on this track).

 

STILL ILL

I decree today that life
is simply taking and not giving
England is mine and it owes me a living
ask me why, and I'll spit in your eye
ask me why, and I'll spit in your eye
but we cannot cling to the old dreams anymore
no, we cannot cling to the old dreams anymore
Does the body rule the mind
or does the mind rule the body?
I dunno...
Under the iron bridge we kissed
and although I ended up with sore lips
it just wasn't like the old days anymore
no, it wasn't like those days
am I still ill?
Does the body rule the mind
or does the mind rule the body ?
I dunno...
Ask me why, and I'll die
ask me why, and I'll die
and if you must go to work tomorrow
well, if I were you I wouldn't bother
for there are brighter sides to life
and I should know because I've seen them
but not very often...
under the iron bridge we kissed
and although I ended up with sore lips
it just wasn't like the old days anymore
no, it wasn't like those days
am I still ill?

 

BIGMOUTH STRIKES AGAIN

Sweetness, sweetness I was only joking
when I said Id like to smash every tooth
in your head
Sweetness, sweetness I was only joking
when I said by right s you should be
bludgeoned in your bed
and now I know how Joan of Arc felt
now I know how Joan of Arc felt
as the flames roseto her roman nose
and her Walkman stared to melt
Bibmouth, bigmouth
bigmouth strikes again
and Ive got no right to take my place
with the Human race
and now I know how Joan of Arc felt
now I know of Joan of Arc felt
as the flames rose to her roman nose
and her hearing aid started to melt
Bigmouth, bigmouth
bigmouth strikes again
and Ive got no right to take my place
with the Human race

 
ALSATIAN COUSTIN

Were you and he Lovers?
and would you say so if you were?
on a forecourt
on a Friday
passing my way
Were you and he Lovers?
and if you were, then say that you were!
on a groundsheet
under canvas
with your tent-flap
open wide
A note upon his desk:
"P.S. Bring Me Home And Have Me!"
Leather elbows on a tweed coat
- Oh! -
Is THAT the best you can do?
So came his reply:
"...but on the desk is where I want you!"
So I ask (even though I know):
were you and he Lovers?

 

LITTLE MAN, WHAT NOW?

An afternoon nostalgia
television show
you spoke in silhouette
(but they couldn't name you)
although the panel were
very polite to you
but I remembered you
from Friday nights 1969
ATV - you murdered every line
too old to be a child star
too young to take leads
four seasons passed
and they AXED you
nervously juvenile
(WON'T SMILE!)
What became of you?
did that swift eclipse torture you?
a star at eighteen
and then-suddenly gone
down to a few lines
in the back page of a teenage annual
oh but I remembered you
I looked up to you

 

EVERYDAY IS LIKE SUNDAY

Trudging slowly over wet sand
back to the bench
where your clothes were stolen
this is the coastal town
that they forgot to close down
Armageddon - come Armageddon!
Come Armageddon! Come!
Everyday is like Sunday
everyday is silent and grey
Hide on the promenade
scratch out a postcard
"how I dearly with I was not here"
in the seaside town
...that they forgot to bomb
Come! Come! Come - nuclear bomb!
Everyday is like Sunday
everyday is silent and grey
Trudging back over pebbles and sand
and a strange dust lands on your hands
(and on your face)
Everyday is like Sunday
"Win Yourself A Cheap Tray"
share some greased tea with me
everyday is silent and grey

 

BENGALI IN PLATFORMS

No no no
he does not want to depress you
oh no no no no no
he only wants to impress you
Bengali in platform
she only wants to embrace your culture
and to be your friend forever
Bengali, Bengali
oh shelve your Western plans
and understand that life is hard enough when you belong here
A silver-studded rim that glistens
and an ankle-star that...blinds me
a lemon sole so very high
which only reminds me, to tell you
so I break the news gently
I break the news to you gently
"Shelve your plans"
Bengali, Bengali
its the touchy march of time
that blinds you
don't blame me
don't hate me
just because I'm the one to tell you
that life is hard enough when you belong here
life is hard enough when you belong here
shelve your western plans
life is hard enough when you belong here

 

ANGEL, ANGEL, DOWN WE GO TOGETHER

Angel, Angel
don't take your life tonight
I know they take
and that they take in turn
and they give you nothing real
for yourself in return
and when they've used you
and they've broken you
and wasted all your money
and cast your shell aside
and when they've bought you
and they've sold you
and they've billed you for the pleasure
and they've made your parents cry
I will be here
BELIEVE ME
I will be here
...believe me
Angel, don't take your life
some people have got no pride
they do not understand
the Urgency of life
but I love you more than life
I love you more than life
I love you more than life
I love you more than life

 

LALE NIGHT, MAUDLIN STREET

The last night on Maudlin Street
goodbye house
goodbye stairs
I was born here
I was raised here, and
...I took some stick here
love at first sight
may sound trite
but it's true, you know
I could list the details
of everything you ever wore
or said, or how you stood that day
and as we spend the last night
on Maudlin Street, I say
"goodbye house-forever!"
I never stole a happy hour
around here
Where the world's ugliest boy
became what you see
here I am - the ugliest man
Its the last night on Maudlin Street
and truly I do love you
oh, truly I do love you
When I sleep with that picture of
you framed beside my bed
oh, it's childish and it's silly
but I think it's you in my room
by the bed (...yes, I told you it was silly...)
and I know
I took strange pills
but I never meant to hurt you
oh truly I love you
I came home late one night
everyone had gone to bed
nobody stays up for you
when you have sixteen stitches
all around your head
the last buss I missed to Maudlin Street
so, he drove me home in the Van
complaining: "Women only like me for my mind..."
don't leave your torch behind
power-cuts ahead
as we crept through the park
but no I cannot steal a pair of jeans
off a clothesline for you
but you...without clothes
oh I could not keep a straight face
me - without clothes?
well a nation turns its back and gags...
I'm packed
I am moving house
a half-life disappears today
every slag waves me on
(secretly wishing me gone
well, I will be soon
oh - I will be soon)
There were bad times on Maudlin Street
when they took you away in a police car
dear Inspector - don't you know?
don't you care?
don't you know - about Love?
Your gran died
and your mother died
on Maudlin Street
in pain and ashamed
with never time to say
those special things
I took the keys from Maudlin Street
well, it's only bricks and mortar!
and...truly I do love you
wherever you are
wherever you are

 

SUEDHEAD

Why do you come here
why do you hang around
I'm so sorry
I'm so sorry
Why do you come here
when you know it makes
things hard for me
when you know, oh
why do you come?
Why do you telephone?
and why send me silly notes?
I'm so sorry
I'm so sorry
why do you come here
when you know it makes
thing hard for me
when you know, oh
why do you come?
You had to sneak into my room
'just' to read my diary
was it just to see all the things
you knew I'd written about you?
and...so many illustrations
I'm so very sickened
oh, I am so sickened NOW

 

BREAK UP THE FAMILY

The strange logic of your clumsiest line
stayed emblazoned on my mind
break up the family
and lets begin to live our lives
I went to see all my friends tonight
it wasn't Youth, it wasn't even Life
born Old, sadly wise
resigned (well, we were)
to ending our lives
I'm so glad to grow older
to move away from those awful times
I want to see all my friends tonight
Yes you found love but you weren't
at peace with your life
home late, full of Hate
despise the ties that bind
oh I'm so glad to grow older
to move away from those younger years
now I'm in love for the first time
and I don't feel bad
Let me see all my old friends
let me put my arm around them
because I really do love them
now, does that sound mad?
Captain of games, solid framed
I stood on the touchline
hailstones, driven home
in his car - no breaks? I don't mind
I'm just so glad to grow older
to move away from those darker years
I'm in love for the first time
and I don't feel bad
so wish me luck my friends
goodbye

 

HAIRDRESSER ON FIRE

Here is London
here is London
is it home of the free,
or what?
can you squeeze me
into an empty page of your diary
and psychologically save me
I've got faith in you
I sense the power
in the fingers
within an hour the power
can totally destroy me
or it could same my life
here is London
'home of the brash, outrageous
and free'
you are repressed
but you're remarkably dressed
is it Real?
but you're far to busy
busy scissors
busy clippers
hair dresser on fire
all around Sloane Square
and you're far too busy
to see me
"busy,busy"
hairdresser on fire
was a client over-cautious
he made you nervous
and when he said
"I'm gonna sue you"
I really felt for you
so can you squeeze me
into an empty page of your diary
and supernaturally change me
CHANGE ME, CHANGE ME

 

THE ORDINARY BOYS

Ordinary boys, happy knowing nothing
happy being no one, but themselves
Ordinary girls, supermarket clothes
who think it's very clever to be cruel to you
for you were so different
you stood all alone
and you knew
that it had to be so
avoiding ordinary boys
happy going nowhere, just around here
in their rattling cars
and ordinary girls
never seeing further
than the cold, small streets
that trap them
but you were so different
you had to say no
when those empty fools
tried to change you, and claim you
for the lair of their ordinary world
where they feel so lucky
so lucky, so lucky
with their lives laid out before them
they're so lucky, so lucky
so lucky, so lucky

 

I DON'T MIND IF YOU FORGET ME

I don't mind
I don't mind if you forget me
having learned my lesson
I never left an impression on anyone
so now you send me your hardened 'regards'
when once you'd send me 'love'
sincerely I must tell you
your mild 'best wishes'
they make me suspicious
but I don't mind
I don't mind if you forget me
having learned my lesson
I never left
an impression on anyone
the pressure to change, to move on
was strange
and very strong
so this is why I tell you
I really do understand
BYE BYE
I don't mind if you forget me
no no no no no no no
REJECTION IS ONE THING
BUT REJECTION FROM A FOOL
IS CRUEL
REJECTION IS ONE THING
BUT REJECTION FROM A FOOL
IS CRUEL
and I don't mind if you forget me
I don't mind if your forget me

 

DIAL-A-CLICHE

Further into the fog I fall
well, I was just
following you!
when you said:
"Do as I do and scrap your fey ways"
(dial-a-cliche)
"grow up, be a man, and close your mealy-mouth!"
(dial-a-cliche)
But the person underneath
where does he go?
does he slide by the wayside?
or...does he just die?
when you find that you've organized
your feelings, for people
who didn't like you then
and certainly don't like you now
yet still you say:
"Do as I do and scrap your fey ways"
(dial-a-cliche)
"grow up, be a man, and close your mealy-mouth!"
(dial-a-cliche)
"the Safe way is the only way!
there's always time to change, son!"
yes well I've changed
but I'm in pain!
dial-a-chiche

 

MARGARET ON THE GUILLOTINE

The kind people
have a wonderful dream
Margaret on the guillotine
because people like you
make me feel so tired
when will you die?
when will you die?
when will you die?
when will you die?
when will you die?
because people like you
make me feel so old inside
please die
and kind people
do not shelter this dream
make it real
make the dream real
make the dream real
make it real

 

OUR FRANK

Our frank and open
deep conversations
they get me nowhere
they bring me down, so
give it a rest, won't you?
give me a cigarette
God give me patience
just no more conversation
Give us a drink
and make it quick
or else I'm gonna be sick
sick all over
your frankly vulgar
red pullover
now see how the colours blend
Our frank and open
deep conversations
they get me nowhere
they bring me down, so
give it a rest, won't you?
now will you just give over
the world may be ending
but look, I'm only human
Give us a drink
and make it quick
or else I'm gonna be sick
all over
your frankly vulgar
red pullover
now see how the two colours blend
Won't somebody stop me
from thinking all the time
about everything
so deeply
so bleakly

 

ASIAN RUT

Day oh so late
strangely the sun still shone
oh Asian boy
what are you on?
Day oh so late
strangely the sun still shone
what drugs are you on?
Tooled-up Asian boy
has come here to avenge
the cruel, cold killing
of his very best friend
Tooled-up Asian boy
has come here to take revenge
for the cruel, cold killing
of his only friend
Peace through the school
so quiet in the hall
it's a strange sign for one
of what's to come
Tough and hard and pale
oh they may just impale you on railings
oh English boys
it must be wrong
three against one?
Brakes slammed, and
a gun jammed, and
as far as I could tell
brave Asian boy
dealt a blow and fell
I'm just passing through here
on my way to somewhere civilised
and maybe I'll even arrive
maybe I'll even arrive?

 

SING YOUR LIFE

Sing your life
any fool can think of words that rhyme
many others do
why don't you?
do you want to?
Sing your life
just walk right up to the microphone
and name
all the things that you love
all the things that you loathe
sing your life
all the things that you love
all the things that you loathe
oh sing your life
oh sing your life
Others sang your life
but now's your chance to shine
and have the pleasure of
saying what you mean
the rare pleasure of
meaning what you sing
oh, make no mistake, my friend
all of this will end
so sing it now
all the things you love
all the things you loathe
oh sing your life
all the things that you love
all the things that you loathe
oh sing your, oh sing your
Don't leave it all unsaid
somewhere in the wasteland of your head
and make no mistake, my friend
your pointless life will end
but before you go
can you look at the truth?
You have a lovely singing voice
a lovely singing voice
and all of those
who sing on key
they stole the notion
from you and me

 

MUTE WITNESS

Your poor witness
crying so loudly on the floor
oh but she's only trying to tell you
what it was that she saw
she is only trying to tell you
what it was that she saw
Now see her standing on the table
with her small arms flailing
and you feel such compassion
in your soul for
Your poor mute witness
still testing the strength
of our patience
oh but she's only trying to tell you
what it was that she saw
Now see her pointing to the frisbee
with a memory too fuzzy
as her silent words
describe the fright of last night
4 a.m. Norhtside, Clapham Common
who knows what she was doing there?
will she sketch the answer later?
Well, I'll ask her
"now dry your tears, my dear"
Now see her mime in time so nicely
it would all have been so clear
is only she had never volunteered
"your taxi is here, my dear"

 

KING LEER

Your boyfriend, he
went down on one knee
well, could it be
he's only got one knee?
I tried to surprise you
with Vodka
or, Tizer
I can't quite remember
but you didn't thank me
you didn't even thank me
because you never do
Your boyfriend, he
has the gift of the gab
or, could it be
the gift of the grab?
I tried to surprise you
I lay down beside you
and...nothing much happened
and you didn't phone me
you didn't even phone me
because it's not your style
to dial
Your boyfriend, he
displays to me
more than just
a hint of cruelty
I tried to surprise you
I crept up behind you
with a homeless chihuahua
you gushed for an hour
you handed him back and said
"You'll never guess
I'm bored now"

 

FOUND FOUND FOUND

found found found found found found
someone who's worth it
in this murkiness
someone who's never
seeming scheming
found found found found found found
someone who's worth it
in this murkiness
someone who's never
seeming scheming
Oh, but if I'd never found
oh, but if I'd never found
oh, but if I'd never found
I do believe that
the more you give your love
and I do believe that
the more you offer trust
the more you chase
the more you cry
the more you're bound to lose
the more you're bound to lose
Oh, but if I'd never found
oh, but if I'd never found
somebody
who wants to be
who wants to be
with me
all the time

 

DRIVING YOUR GIRLFRIEND HOME

I'm driving
your girlfriend home
and she's saying
how she never chose you
"turn left", she says
so I turn left
and she says
"So how did I end up
so deeply involved in
the very existence
I planned on avoiding?"
and I can't answer
I'm driving
your girlfriend home
and she's laughing
to stop herself crying
"drive on", she says
so I drive on
and she says
"So how did I end up
attached to this person
when his sense of humour
gets gradually worser?"
and I can't tell her
I'm parking
outside her home
and we're shaking hands
goodnight, so politely

 

THE HARSH TRUTH OF THE CAMERA EYE

Churchillian legs
hair barely there
the harsh truth of the camera eye
Your eyes signal pain
because of the strain
of smiling
the harsh truth of the camera eye
telling you all
that you never wnated to know
showing what
you didn't want shown
My so friendly lens
zooms into
"the inner you"
and it tells the harsh truth
and nothing but
Laugh with us all here
that's if you can
then take the pictures home
and screamtelling you all
that you never wanted to know
showing you what
you didn't want shown
This photographer
he must have really had it in for you
"Oh, I don't want
to be judged anymore
I don't wnat to be judged
I would sooner be Loved
I would sooner be
just blindly Loved..."

 

(I'M) THE END OF THE FAMILY LINE

With no complications
fifteen generations
(of mine)
all honouring Nature
until I arrive
(with incredible style)
I'm the end fo the line
the end of the family line
the end of the line
No baby pulled screaming
out into this seething whirl
by chance or whim
(or even love?)
our family tree hacked into decline
and I'm spared the pain
of ever saying
("goodbye")
I'm the end of the line
the end of the family line
the end of the line

 

THERE'S A PLACE IN HELL FOR ME AND MY FRIENDS

There is a place
reserved
for me and my friends
and when we go
we all will go
so you see
I'm never alone
there is a place
with a bit more time
and a few more
gentler words
and looking back
we do forgive
(we had no choice
we always did)
all that we hope
is that when we go
our skin
and our blood
and our bones
don't get in your way
making you ill
the way they did
when we lived
There is a place
a place in hell
reserved
for me and my friends
and if ever I
wanted to cry
then I will
because I can

 

TONY THE PONY

Still drinking on the corner 
Just don't say I didn't warn you 
Always nagging big brother 
He's only looking out for you 
Tony The Pony 
Tony The Pony 
You're still standing on the corner 
Just don't say I didn't warn you 
Old and jealous big brother 
You had your time and you spent it 
Crying 
Now, Tony The Pony 
Tony The Pony 
So, that's what they call you now ? 
When you're free outside 
So cold and hard and in control 
And ... 
There's a free ride on 
Tony The Pony 
Oh, why do you always wanna stop me 
From doing the things in life that make me happy ? 
And when I'm outside with friends, laughing loudly 
Why do you always wanna stop me ? 
Oh, I would never 
I would never 
But you will carry the can for anyone 
The free ride on 
Gullible Tony 
You're drunker quicker 
And you're sicker even quicker 
For something heavy is gonna fall on you 
Oh ... 
And what do they call you now ? 
When you're free outside 
So cold and hard and in control 
And, oh ... been a lark 
There's a free ride on 
Fucked-up Tony 
I will never say I told you so 
Or how I knew that something bad 
Would happen to you 
I don't wanna say I told you so 
Oh, but Tony, I told you so !!! 
I told you so

 

YOU'RE GONNA NEED SOMEONE ON YOUR SIDE

With the world's fate 
Resting on your shoulder 
You're gonna need 
Someone on your side 
You can't do it by yourself 
Any longer 
You're gonna need 
Someone on your side 
Someone kindly told me 
That you'd wasted 
Eight of nine lives
Oh, give yourself a break 
Before you break down 
You're gonna need someone on your side 
And here I am, And here I am 
Well, you don't need 
To look so pleased ! 
Day or night, 
There is no difference 
You're gonna need someone on your side 
Day or night, 
There is no difference 
You're gonna need someone soon 
And here I am, And here I am 
Well, you don't need 
To look so pleased

 

GLAMOROUS GLUE

First day with the jar 
You find 
Everyone lies 
First day with the jar 
You find 
Everyone lies, nobody minds 
Everyone lies 
Where is the man you respect ? 
And where is the woman you love ? 
Where's the woman you love ? 
Third week with the jar
You find 
Everything dies 
We won't vote Conservative 
Because we never have 
Everyone lies, everyone lies 
Where is the man you respect ? 
And where is the woman you love ? 
Where's the woman you love ? 
Everything of worth 
On Earth Is there To share 
I used to dream, and I used to vow 
I wouldn't dream of it now 
We look to Los Angeles 
For the language we use 
London is dead, London is dead, London is dead...
Now I'm too much in love 
I'm too much in love 
I know 
I'll go 
Empty hand 
From the land

 

WE'LL LET YOU KNOW

How sad are we ? 
And how sad have we been ? 
We'll let you know 
We'll let you know 
Oh, but only if - you're really interested 
You wonder how 
We've stayed alive 'till now 
We'll let you know 
We'll let you know 
But only if - you're really interested 
We're all smiles 
Then, honest, I swear, it's the turnstiles 
That make us hostile 
Oh ... 
We will descend 
On anyone unable to defend 
Themselves 
Oh ... 
And the songs we sing 
They're not supposed to mean a thing 
La, la, la, la ... 
Oh ...You're lonely, Oh ... you're lonely, Oh ... 
GET OFF THE ROOF ! Oh ... 
Your Arsenal !
We may seem cold, or 
We may even be 
The most depressing people you've ever known 
At heart, what's left, we sadly know 
That we are the last truly British people you'll ever know 
We are the last truly British people you will ever know 
You'll never never want to know

 

THE NATIONAL FRONT DISCO

David, the wind blows 
The wind blows ... 
Bits of your life away 
Your friends all say ... 
"Where is our boy ? Oh, we've lost our boy" 
But they should know 
Where you've gone 
Because again and again you've explained that 
You're going to ... 
Oh, you're going to ... 
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah 
England for the English ! 
England for the English ! 
David, the winds blow 
The winds blow ...
All of my dreams away 
And I still say : 
"Where is our boy ? Ah, we've lost our boy" 
But I should know 
Why you've gone 
Because again and again you've explained
You've gone to the ... 
National, ah ... 
To the National .. 
There's a country; you don't live there 
But one day you would like to 
And if you show them what you're made of 
Oh, then you might do ... 
But David, we wonder 
We wonder if the thunder 
Is ever really gonna begin 
Begin, begin 
Your mom says : 
"I've lost my boy" 
But she should know 
Why you've gone 
Because again and again you've explained 
You've gone to the : 
National 
To the National 
To the National Front Disco 
Because you want the day to come sooner 
You want the day to come sooner 
You want the day to come sooner 
When you've settled the score 
Oh, the National 
Oh, the National

 

CERTAIN PEOPLE I KNOW

I take the cue from 
Certain people I know 
I use the cue 
And then I 
Hand it on to you 
And when I swing it 
So, it catches his eye ... 
(Weren't you there ? 
- You'd have died !) 
I trust the views of 
Certain people I know 
They look at Danger 
And they 
LAUGH THEIR HEADS OFF 
Their clothes are Imitation 
George the 23rd 
(Don't you find this absurd ?) 
I'd hate to be like 
Certain people I know 
They break their necks 
And can't afford to
Get them fixed 
Ah, they'd sacrifice all 
Of their principles for 
anything cashable 
I do believe it's terrible 
Oh, wo, wo, Ah, ah, ah, ah, Oh, wo, wo...

 

WE HATE IT WHEN OUR FRIENDS BECOME SUCCESSFUL

We hate it when our friends become successful 
We hate it when our friends become successful 
Oh, look at those clothes 
Now look at that face, it's so old 
And such a video ! 
Well, it's really laughable 
Ha, ha, ha ...
We hate it when our friends become successful 
And if they're Northern, that makes it even worse
And if we can destroy them 
You bet your life we will 
Destroy them 
If we can hurt them 
Well, we may as well ... 
It's really laughable 
Ha, ha, ha ... 
You see, it should've been me 
It could've been me 
Everybody knows 
Everybody says so 
They say : 
"Ah, you have loads of songs 
So many songs 
More songs than they'd stand

SEASICK, YET STILL DOCKED

I am a poor freezingly cold soul 
So far from where 
I intended to go 
Scavenging through life's very constant lulls 
So far from where I'm determined to go 
Wish I knew the way to reach the one I love
There is no way ... 
Wish I had the charm to attract the one I love 
But you see, I've got no charm 
Mmm...
Tonight I've consumed much more than I can hold 
Oh, this is very clear to you 
And you can tell I have never really loved 
You can tell, by the way, I sleep all day
And all of my life no-one gave me anything 
No-one has ever given me anything 
My love is as sharp as a needle in your eye 
You must be such a fool 
To pass me by

 

I KNOW IT'S GONNA HAPPEN SOMEDAY

My love, wherever you are 
Whatever you are 
Don't lose faith 
I know it's gonna happen someday 
To you 
Please wait ... Please wait ... Oh ... Wait ... 
Don't lose faith 
You say that the day just never arrives 
And it's never seemed so far away 
Still, I know it's gonna happen someday 
To you 
Please wait ... 
Don't lose faith

Tomorrow

Would you put your arms around me ?

Tomorrow 
Does it have to come ?
All I ask of you is one thing that you'll never do 
Would you put your arms around me ? 
(I won't tell anybody) 
Tomorrow 
And what must come before ...
Oh, the pain in my arms 
Oh, the pain in my legs 
Ooh, my shiftless body 
Tomorrow 
It's surely nearer now ? 
You don't think I'll make it 
I never said I wanted to ! 
Well did I ? 
Oh, the pain in my arms 
Oh, the pain in my legs 
Oh, yeah; oh, yeah, No, yeah; no, yeah 
Through my shiftless body 
Tomorrow, Tomorrow 
All I ask of you ... oh ... 
Is : would you tell me that you love me 
Tell me, tell me that you love me, Tell me, tell me that you love me ... 
Ah, I know you don't mean it 
Ah, I know you don't mean it 
Tell me, tell me that you love me, Tell me, tell me that you love me ...

NOVEMBER SPAWNED A MONSTER

Sleep on and dream of Love
because it's the closest you will get to love
poor twisted child, so ugly, so ugly
poor twisted child, oh hug me, oh hug me
one November spawned a monster 
in the shape of this child who later cried
"But Jesus made me, so Jesus save me from
pity, sympathy and people discussing me"
a frame of useless limbs what can make GOOD
all the BAD that's been done?
And if the lights were out
could you even bear
to kiss her full on the mouth (or anywhere?)
poor twisted child, so ugly, so ugly
poor twisted child, oh hug me, oh hug me
one November spawned a monster 
in the shape of this child who must remain
a hostage to kindess and the wheels underneath her
a hostage to kindess and the wheels underneath her
a symbol of where mad, mad lovers
must PAUSE and draw the line
So sleep and dream of love
because it's the closest
you will get to love
that November is a time which I must put OUT of my mind
oh one fine day 
LET IT BE SOON
she won't be rich or beautiful
but she'll be walking your streets
in the clothes that she went out
and chose for herself

 

SEASICK, YET STILL DOCKED

I am a poor freezingly cold soul

THE LOOP

I just wanna say 
I haven't been away 
I'm still right here 
Where I always was 
So one day, if you're bored 
By all means call 
Because you can do 
(But only if you want to) 
I just wanna say 
I haven't been away 
I am still right here 
Where I always was 
So one day, when you're bored 
By all means call 
Because you can do 
But you might not get through

 

SISTER I'M A POET

All over this town 
Yes, a low wind may blow 
And I can see through everybo... 
With no reason 
To hide these words I feel 
And no reason 
To talk about the books I read 
But still I do 
That's 'cause I'm a ... Sister I'm a ... 
All over this town 
Along this way 
Outside the prison gates 
I love the romance of crime 
And I wonder 
Does anybody feel the way I do ? 
And is evil just something you are 
Or something you do ? 
Sister I'm a ... Sister I'm a ... 
All over this town, All over this town 
They pull over 
In their Citroen vans 
Not to shake your hand 
With meths on their breaths 
And you with youth on your side 
A plastic bag stranded at the lights 
This once was me ...
But now I'm a ... Sister I'm a ...
All over this town ... Oh, oh, oh 
All over this town, All over this town, Oh ... 
I still cannot speak French ... I am very lazy

 

JACK THE RIPPER

Oh, you look so tired 
Mouth slack and wide 
Ill-housed and ill-advised 
Your face is as mean 
As your life has been 
Crash into my arms 
I WANT YOU 
You don't agree -
But you don't refuse 
I know you 
And I know a place 
Where no one is likely to pass 
Oh, you don't care if it's late 
And you don't care if you're lost 
And oh, you look so tired 
(But tonight you presumed too much) 
Too much, too much 
And if it's the last 
Thing I ever do 
I'M GONNA GET YOU 
Crash into my arms 
I WANT YOU 
You don't agree -
But you don't refuse 
I know you 
And no one knows a thing about my life 
I can come and go as I please 
And if I want to, I can stay 
Oh, or if I want to, I can leave 
Nobody knows me, Nobody knows me, Nobody knows me Oh, oh...

 

SUCH A LITTLE THING MAKES SUCH A BIG DIFFERENCE

Such a little thing, such a little thing
but the difference it made was grave
there you go
wielding a bicycle chain
oh why won't you change
cange and be nicer?
such a little thing
a gentle tone of kindness
or written words on paper
- can you write?
How I love all of
the very simple things of life
(God's good air)
how I love all of
the very simple things of life
such a little thing
a fumbling politeness
the difference it saved me
wielding a bicycle chain
"I WILL NOT CHANGE AND I WILL NOT BE NICE"
Most people keep their brains between your legs (don't you find?)
Leave me alone - I was only singing, leave me alone because
I was only singing
leave me alone - I was only singing, leave me alone
you have just proved (again)
MOST PEOPLE KEEP THEIR BRAINS BETWEEN THEIR LEGS

 

I KNOW IT'S GONNA HAPPEN SOMEDAY

My love, wherever you are

You say that the day just never arrives 
And it's never seemed so far away

WE'LL LET YOU KNOW

How sad are we ? 
And how sad have we been ? 
We'll let you know, We'll let you know 
Oh, but only if - you're really interested 
You wonder how 
We've stayed alive 'till now 
We'll let you know, We'll let you know 
But only if - you're really interested 
We're all smiles 
Then, honest, I swear, it's the turnstiles 
That make us hostile 
Oh ... We will descend

Oh ... And the songs we sing 
They're not supposed to mean a thing 
La, la, la, la ... Oh ...
You're lonely, Oh ... you're lonely 
Oh ... 
GET OFF THE ROOF !
Oh ... Your Arsenal !
We may seem cold, or 
We may even be 
The most depressing people you've ever known 
At heart, what's left, we sadly know 
That we are the last truly British people you'll ever know 
We are the last truly British people you will ever know 
You'll never never want to know

 

SUEDHEAD

Why do you come here
why do you hang around
I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry
Why do you come here
when you know it makes
things hard for me
when you know, oh
why do you come?
Why do you telephone?
and why send me silly notes?
I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry
why do you come here
when you know it makes
thing hard for me
when you know, oh
why do you come?
You had to sneak into my room
'just' to read my diary
was it just to see all the things
you knew I'd written about you?
and...so many illustrations
I'm so very sickened
oh, I am so sickened NOW

 

HE KNOWS I'D LOVE TO SEE HIM

He Knows (he knows)
Or, I think he does
because when I lived
in the Arse of the world...
he knows, he knows, he knows I'd love
to see him happy (or as close as is allowed)
because when I lived
in the Arse of the world
he knows, he knows, he knows I'd love
to see him happy (or as close as possible
as close as possible, as close as is allowed)
My name still conjours up deadly deeds
and a bad taste in the mouth
the police - they actually knew me
they said:
"You're just another person in the world
you're just another fool with radical views
you're just another who has maddening views
you want to turn it on its head
by staying in bed!"
I said: "I know I do"

 

YOU'RE GONNA NEED SOMEONE ON YOUR SIDE

You're gonna need someone on your side 
And here I am, And here I am 
Well, you don't need 
To look so pleased ! 
Day or night, 
There is no difference 
You're gonna need someone on your side 
Day or night, 
There is no difference 
You're gonna need someone soon 
And here I am, And here I am 
Well, you don't need

NOW MY HEART IS FULL

There's gonna be some trouble 
A whole house will need re-building 
And everyone I love in the house 
Will recline on an analyst's couch quite

Your Father cracks a joke

Empties the room 
Tell all of my friends

Just some rain-coated lovers' puny brothers)
Dallow, Spicer, Pinkie, Cubitt 
Rush to danger 
Wind up nowhere 
Patric Doonan - raised to wait 
I'm tired again, I've tried again, and 
Now my heart is full 
Now my heart is full 
And I just can't explain 
So I won't even try to

Underact - express depression 
Ah, but Bunnie I loved you 
I was tired again 
I've tried again, and 
Now my heart is full 
Now my heart is full 
And I just can't explain 
So I won't even try to 
Could you pass by ? 
Could you pass by ? 
Oh ... 
Now my heart is full

SPRING-HEELED JIM

Spring-heeled Jim winks an eye 
He'll "do", he'll never be "done to" 
He takes on whoever flew through 
"Well, it's the normal thing to do" ... ah ... 
Spring-heeled Jim lives to love 
Now kissing with his mouth full 
And his eyes on some other fool 
So many women 
His head should be spinning 
Ah, but no ! 
Ah, but no ! 
But no !
Ah, no !
Spring-heeled Jim slurs the words : 
"There's no need to be so knowing
Take life at five times the 
Average speed, like I do" 
Until Jim feels the chill 
"Oh, where did all the time go ?" 
Once always in for the kill 
Now it's too cold 
And he feels too 
old 
Too old
Mmm, old... 
La, la, la, la-la, la ...

 

BILLY BUDD

Say, Billy Budd 
So you think you should ? 
Oh, everyone's laughing 
Say, Billy Budd 
So you think that you should ? 
Everyone's laughing ! 
Since I took up with you 
Things have been bad 
Yeah, but now it's 12 years on 
Now it's 12 years on 
Yes, and I took up with you 
I took my job application 
Into town 
Did you hear ? They turned me down 
Yes, and it's all because of us 
Oh, and what was in our eyes 
Oh, what was in our eyes, yeah 
I said, Billy Budd 
I would happily lose 
Both of my legs 
I would lose both of my legs 
Oh, if it meant you could be free 
Oh, if it meant you could be free 
(Don't leave us in the dark!)

 

HOLD ON TO YOUR FRIENDS

A bond of trust 
Has been abused 
Something of value 
May be lost 
Give up your job 
Squander your cash - be rash 
Just hold on to your friends 
There are more than enough 
To fight and oppose 
Why waste good time 
Fighting the people you like 
Who will fall defending your name 
Oh, don't feel so ashamed 
To have friends 
But now you only call me 
When you're feeling depressed 
When you feel happy I'm 
So far from your mind 
My patience is stretched 
My loyalty vexed 
Oh, you're losing all of your friends 
Hold on to your friends 
Hold on to your friends 
Resist - or move on 
Be mad, be rash 
Smoke and explode 
Sell all of your clothes 
Just bear in mind : 
Oh, there just might come a time 
When you need some friends

 

THE MORE YOU IGNORE ME, THE CLOSER I GET

The more you ignore me 
The closer I get 
You're wasting your time 
The more you ignore me 
The closer I get 
You're wasting your time 
I will be 
In the bar 
With my head 
On the bar 
I am now 
A central part 
Of your mind's landscape 
Whether you care 
Or do not 
Yeah, I've made up your mind 
The more you ignore me 
The closer I get 
You're wasting your time 
The more you ignore me 
The closer I get 
You're wasting your time 
Beware !
I bear more grudges 
Than lonely high court judges 
When you sleep 
I will creep 
Into your thoughts 
Like a bad debt 
That you can't pay 
Take the easy way 
And give in 
Yeah, and let me in 
Oh, let me in 
Oh let me ... 
Oh, let me in 
IT'S WAR 
IT'S WAR 
WAR 
WAR 
Oh, let me in 
Ah, the closer I get 
Ah, you're asking for it 
Ah, the closer I get 
Ooh, the closer I ...

 

WHY DON'T YOU FIND OUT FOR YOURSELF

The sanest days are mad 
Why don't you find out for yourself ? 
Then you'll see the price 
Very closely 
Some men here 
They have a special interest 
In your career 
They wanna help you to grow 
And then syphon all your dough 
Why don't you find out for yourself ? 
Then you'll see the glass 
Hidden in the grass 
You'll never believe me, so 
Why don't you find out for yourself ? 
Sick down to my heart 
That's just the way it goes 
Some men here 
They know the full extent of 
Your distress 
They kneel and pray 
And they say : 
"Long may it last" 
Why don't you find out for yourself ?
Then you'll see the glass 
Hidden in the grass 
Bad scenes come and go 
For which you must allow 
Sick down to my heart 
That's just the way it goes 
Don't rake up my mistakes 
I know exactly what they are 
And ... what do YOU do ? 
Well ... you just SIT THERE 
I've been stabbed in the back 
So many many times 
I don't have any skin 
But that's just the way it goes

 

I AM HATED FOR LOVING

I am hated for loving 
I am hated for loving 
Anonymous call, a poison pen 
A brick in the small of the back again 
I still don't belong 
To anyone - I am mine 
And I am hated for loving 
I am haunted for wanting 
Anonymous call, a poison pen 
A brick in the ... ah ... 
A brick in the small of the back again 
I still don't belong 
To anyone - I am mine 
I am falling 
With no-one to catch me 
I am falling 
And there's still 
No-one to catch me 
Ah .. 
Anonymous call, a poison pen 
A brick in the ... ah ... 
A brick in the small of the back again 
I just don't belong 
To anywhere 
I just don't belong 
Mmm ... 
Ah ...

 

LIFEGUARD SLEEPING, GIRL DROWNING

Always looking for attention 
Always needs to be mentioned 
Who does she 
Think she should be ? 
The shrill cry through darkening air 
Doesn't she know he's 
Had such a busy day ? 
Tell her ... sshhh
Somebody tell her ... sshhh 
Slowest ... 
It was only a test 
But she swam too far 
Against the tide 
She deserves all she gets 
The sky became marked with stars 
As an out-stretched arm slowly 
Disappears 
Hooray 
Oh hooray 
No, oh, oh, woh, there's no movement 
No, oh, hooray 
Oh, hooray 
Please don't worry 
There'll be no fuss 
She was ... nobody's nothing 
(What's your name ?) 
When he awoke 
The sea was calm 
And another day passes like a dream 
There's no ... no way 
(What's your name ?)

 

USED TO BE A SWEET BOY

Used to be a sweet boy 
Holding so tightly 
To Daddy's hand 
But that was all 
In some distant land 
Blazer and tie 
And a big bright healthy smile 
Used to make all 
Of our trials worthwhile 
Used to be a sweet boy 
And I'm not to blame 
Something went wrong 
And I know 
I'm not to blame 
Something went wrong 
Can't be to blame 
Ah ...

 

THE LAZY SUNBATHERS

A world war 
Was announced 
Days ago 
But they didn't know 
The lazy sunbathers 
The lazy sunbathers 
The sun burns through 
To the planet's core 
And it isn't enough 
They want more 
Nothing 
Appears 
To be 
Between the ears of 
The lazy sunbathers 
Too jaded 
To question stagnation 
The sun burns through 
To the planet's core 
And it isn't enough 
They want more 
Religions fall 
Children shelled 
"...Children shelled ? That's all 
Very well, but would you 
Please keep the noise 
Down low ? 
Because you're waking 
The lazy sunbathers ..."
Oh, the lazy sunbathers 
The lazy sunbathers

 

SPEEDWAY

And when you slam 
Down the hammer 
Can you see it in your heart ? 
All of the rumours 
Keeping me grounded 
I never said, I never said that they were 
Completely unfounded 
So when you slam 
Down the hammer 
Can you see it in your heart ? 
Can you delve so low ? 
And when you're standing 
On my fingers 
Can you see it in your heart ? ... ah ... 
And when you try 
To break my spirit 
It won't work 
Because there's nothing left to break 
Anymore 
All of the rumours 
Keeping me grounded 
I never said, I never said that they were 
Completely unfounded 
You won't sleep 
Until the earth that wants me 
Finally has me 
Oh you've done it now 
You won't rest 
Until the hearse that becomes me 
Finally takes me 
Oh you've done it now 
And you won't smile 
Until my loving mouth 
Is shut good and proper 
FOREVER 
All of the rumours 
Keeping me grounded 
I never said, I never said that they were 
Completely unfounded 
And all those lies 
Written lies, twisted lies 
Well, they weren't lies 
They weren't lies 
They weren't lies 
I never said 
I never said 
I could have mentioned your name 
I could have dragged you in 
Guilt by implication 
By association 
I've always been true to you 
In my own strange way 
I've always been true to you 
In my own sick way 
I'll always stay true to you

 

THE TEACHERS ARE AFRAID OF THE PUPILS

There's too many people 
Planning your downfall 
When your spirit's on trial 
These nights can be frightening 
Sleep transports sadness 
To some other mid-brain 
And somebody here 
Will not be here next year 
So you stand by the board 
Full of fear and intention 
And, if you think that they're listening 
Well, you've got to be joking 
Oh, you understand change 
And you think it's essential 
But when your profession 
Is humiliation 
Say the wrong word to our children ...
We'll have you, oh yes, we'll have you 
Lay a hand on our children 
And it's never too late to have you 
Mucus on your collar 
A nail up through the staff chair 
A blade in your soap 
And you cry into your pillow 
To be finished would be a relief 
To be finished would be a relief... 
Say the wrong word to our children ...
We'll have you, oh yes, we'll have you 
Lay a hand on our children 
And it's never too late to have you 
To be finished would be a relief 
To be finished would be a relief...
I'm very glad this thing has come 
Sometimes I'm so glad 
Never bother to play the tunes 
I've seen it coming for dear life

 

READER MEET AUTHOR

You don't know a thing about their lives 
They live where you wouldn't dare to drive
You shake as you think of how they sleep 
But you write as if you are my side-by-side 
Reader, meet Author 
With the hope of hearing sense 
But you may be feeling let down 
By the words of defence 
He says : "No-one ever sees me when I cry"
You don't know a thing about their lives 
Books don't save them, books aren't Stanley knives 
And if a fight broke out here tonight 
You'd be the first away, because you're that type 
And the Year 2000 won't change anyone here 
As each fabled promise flies so fast 
You'll swear it was never there 
Oh, have you ever escaped from a shipwrecked life ? 
So safely with your software; all miles from the front line 
You hear the way their sad voices, and you start to imagine things 
Oh, any excuse to write more lies

 

THE BOY RACER

He's just too good-natured and

And I'm gonna ... kill him !

THE OPERATION

You fight with your right hand 
And caress with your left hand 
Everyone I know is sick to death of you 
With a tear that's a mile wide 
In the kite that you're flying 
Everyone I know is sick to death of you 
Ever since 
You don't look the same 
You're just not the same, no way 
You say clever things and 
You never used to 
You don't catch what I'm saying 
When you're deafened to advice 
Everyone here is sick to the 
Back teeth of you 
With a tear that's a mile wide 
In the kite that you're flying 
Everyone here is sick to the 
Tattoo of you 
Ever since 
You don't look the same 
You're just not the same, no way 
You say pleasant things and 
There is no need to
Still, you fight with your right hand 
And caress with your left hand 
Ooh, ooh ... Sad to say ... 
How once I was in love with you 
Sad to say ... 
You don't catch what I'm saying 
When you're deafened to advice 
Ooh, ooh ... Ever since 
You don't look the same 
You're just not the same, no way 
What the hell have 
They stuck into you ?

 

DAGENHAM DAVE

Head in the clouds, and a mouthful of pie 
Head in a blouse, everybody loves him 
I see why 
Dagenham Dave, Dagenham Dave, Oh, Dagenham Dave 
Dagenham Dave, Dagenham Dave, Oh, Dagenham Dave 
"I love Karen, I love Sharon" on the windowscreen 
With never the need to fight or to question a single thing 
Dagenham Dave, Dagenham Dave Oh, Dagenham Dave 
Dagenham Dave, Dagenham Dave Oh, Dagenham Dave ...
He'd love to touch, he's afraid that he might self-combust 
I could say more, but you get the general idea 
Dagenham Dave, Dagenham Dave Dagenham Dave, Dagenham Dave 
Dagenham, Dagenham Dagenham Dave, Dagenham Dave ...
Oh, Dave, oh, Dagenham, dagenham, Oh, Dave, oh, Dave, ...

 

DO YOUR BEST AND DON'T WORRY

Compare the best of their days 
With the worst of your days 
You won't win 
With your standards so high 
And your spirits so low 
At least remember ... 
This is you on a bad day, you on a pale day 
Just do your best and don't ... Don't worry, oh 
The way you hang yourself is oh, so unfair 
See the best of how they look 
Against the worst of how you are
And again, you won't win 
With your standards so high 
And your spirits so low 
At least remember ... 
This is you on a drab day, you in a drab dress 
Just do your best and don't ... Don't worry, oh 
The way you hang yourself is oh, so unfair 
Just do your best and don't ... Don't worry, oh 
The way you watch yourself is oh, so unfair 
Just do your best and don't ... Don't worry, oh 
Do your best and don't ...

SOUTHPAW

You were a boy before you became a man 
I don't see the joy 
And you ran with your pals in the sun 
You turned around and they were gone 
Again ... 
A sick boy should be treated 
So easily defeated 
Oh, I just don't understand 
So you ran with your pals in the sun 
You turned around 
You were alone 
Again ... 
And you ran back to Ma 
Which set the pace for the rest of your days 
Oh, you ran back to Ma 
Which set the pace for the rest of your days 
Oh, you ran back to Ma 
Which set the pace for the rest of your days 
And now, there is something that you should know 
There is something that you should know 
The girl of your dreams is 
Here all alone

The girl of your dreams is 
Sad and all alone

Sad and is feeling all alone 
Oh, there is something that you should know 
Help me, help me, help me ...

 

MALADJUSTED

I wanna start from 
Before the beginning 
Loot wine, "Be mine, and 
Then let's stay out for the night"
Ride via Parkside 
Semi-perilous lives 
Jeer the lights in the windows 
Of all safe and stable homes 
(But wondering then, well what 
Could peace of mind be like ?)
Anyway do you want to hear 
Our story, or not ? 
As the Fulham Road lights 
Stretch and invite into the night 
From a Stevenage overspill 
We'd kill to live around 
SW6 - with someone like you 
Keep thieves' hours 
With someone like you 
...As long as it slides 
You stalk the house 
In a low-cut blouse : 
"Oh Christ, another stifled 
Friday night !"
And the Fulham Road lights 
Stretch and invite into the night 
Well, I was fifteen 
What could I know ?
When the gulf between 
All the things I need 
And the things I receive 
Is an ancient ocean 
Wide, wild, lost, uncrossed 
Still I maintain there's nothing 
Wrong with you 
You do all that you do 
Because it's all you can do 
Well, I was fifteen 
Where could I go ?
With a soul full of loathing 
For stinging bureaucracy 
Making it anything 
Other than easy 
For working girls like me 
With my hands on my head 
I flop on your bed 
With a head full of dread 
For all I've ever said 
Maladjusted, maladjusted 
Maladjusted maladjusted 
Never to be trusted 
Oh, never to be trusted 
There's nothing wrong with you, oh 
...There's nothing wrong with you

 

ALMA MATTERS

So : the choice I have made 
May seem strange to you 
But who asked you, anyway ? 
It's my life to wreck 
My own way 
You see : to someone, somewhere, oh yeah ... 
Alma matters 
In mind, body and soul 
In part, and in whole 
Because to someone, somewhere, oh yeah ... 
Alma matters 
In mind, body and soul 
In part, and in whole 
So the life I have made 
May seem wrong to you 
But, I've never been surer 
It's my life to ruin 
My own way 
You see : to someone, somewhere, oh yeah ... 
Alma matters 
In mind, body and soul 
In part, and in whole 
Because to someone, somewhere, oh yeah ... 
Alma matters 
In mind, body and soul 
In part, and in whole 
To someone, somewhere, oh yeah ...

In mind, body and soul 
Part, and in whole

To someone, somewhere, oh yeah ... 
Oh yeah ... Oh yeah, oh yeah Oh yeah ...

 

AMBITIOUS OUTSIDERS

Bolt-lock your doors 
Alarm your cars 
And still we move in closer 
Every day 
Top of the list 
Is your smiling kids 
But we'll be smiling too 
So that's OK 
Oh, and by the way 
Thank you, because you're 
Giving, giving, giving 
And we're receiving - 
No, no, we're taking 
Keeping the population down 
Your taxes paid, but 
Police waylaid 
And we knows 
When the school bus 
Comes and goes 
We're on your street, but 
You don't see us 
Or, if you do 
You smile and say Hello 
BUT DON'T UNDERESTIMATE US 
When you are 
Giving, giving, giving 
And we're receiving - 
No, no, we're taking 
Just keeping 
The population down 
You're giving, giving, giving 
Well, it's your own fault 
For reproducing 
We're just keeping 
The population down

 

TROUBLE LOVES ME

Trouble loves me 
Trouble needs me 
Two things 
More than you do 
Or would attempt to 
So, console me 
Otherwise, hold me 
Just when it seems like 
Everything's evened out 
And the balance 
Seems serene 
Trouble loves me 
Walks beside me 
To chide me 
Not to guide me 
It's still much more 
Than you'll do 
So, console me 
Otherwise, hold me 
Just when it seems like 
Everything's evened out 
And the balance seems serene 
See the fool I'll be 
Still running 'round 
On the flesh rampage 
Still running 'round 
Ready with ready-wit 
Still running 'round 
On the flesh rampage 
- At your age ! 
Go to Soho, oh 
Go to waste in 
The wrong arms 
Still running 'round 
Trouble loves me 
Seeks and finds me 
To charlatanize me 
Which is only 
As it should be 
Oh, please fulfill me 
Otherwise, kill me 
Show me a barrel and watch me scrape it 
Faced with the music, as always I'll face it 
In the half-light 
So English, frowning 
Then at midnight I 
Can't get you out of my head 
A disenchanted taste 
Still running 'round 
A disenchanted taste 
Still running 'round

 

PAPA JACK

Papa Jack 
Wants to turn 
Back the clock 
And reach out 
To the kids 
He once had 
Who have flown 
Papa Jack 
In decline 
Feels inclined 
To reach out 
To the kids 
He once had 
Who have flown 
But there was a time 
When the kids reached up 
And Papa Jack just 
Pushed them away 
Looking deep 
In his heart 
Papa Jack 
Doesn't like 
What he sees 
Or the time 
On his hands 
The dying day 
The chilly sun 
Papa Jack 
All alone 
Sings slow 
Grieving and low 
But there was a time 
When the kids reached up 
Now you can't always 
Have it your way 
Papa Jack 
Ah ...

 

AMMUNITION

I know these roads 
Each ridge 
And narrow bridge 
Each cheveron 
Enticing me on 
Each warning sign 
I take in my stride 
I don't need more ammunition 
I've got more than I can spend 
I don't dwell on things I'm missing 
I'm just pleased 
With the things I've found 
I know these roads 
An old hand understands 
Above all, I know what's 
Expected of me now 
Veering cliffwards 
I don't need more ammunition 
I've got more than I can spend 
I don't dwell on things I'm missing 
I'm just pleased 
With the things I've found 
With the things I've found 
With the things I've found 
I've found 
I've been crying 
It comes back on these salient days 
And it stays 
And it says : 
"We've never really been away" 
I don't need more ammunition 
I've got more than I can spend 
I don't think of who I'm missing 
I've got no space and no time 
In my life, anymore 
No space or time 
In my life, anymore 
For Revenge

 

WIDE TO RECEIVE

Download something 
Useful, or useless 
Because I'm lying here 
Wide to receive 
Almost anything 
You'd care to give 
And I don't 
Get along with myself 
And I'm not too keen 
On anyone else 
Turn on, plug in 
Then just walk away 
Unlock, process 
And then just go 
And I've never felt quite so alone 
As I do right now 
I'm lying here 
Wide to receive 
Almost anything 
You'd care to leave 
Wide, wide, wide Wide, wide, wide...

 

ROY'S KEEN

Back up the ladder 
Into each corner 
Dunking the chamois 
Just think of the goodwill 
The ladder's a planet 
Roy is a star, and 
I am a satellite

He can hold a smile for as long 
As you require (even longer)

Roy is a star, and 
I am a satellite 
I will be set alight 
Don't say you'll hold it steady 
Then you let it go 
Don't say you'll hold it steady 
Then you let it go Oh ...
You're up the ladder 
Into each corner 
Foot in a bucket 
We trust you to wreck it 
Even when it's under your nose 
Well, you just can't 
See it, can you ? 
Well, it's here 
Right under your nose 
And you just can't 
See it, can you? La la la la ...

We've never seen a 
Keener window-cleaner 
Oh ... La la la la ...

 

HE CRIED

I need you 
Simple words 
But words which had never been heard 
By the soul 
Stoned to death 
But still living 
And so he froze where he stood 
And he looked to the ground 
And he cried 
He cried 
Ride our minds 
If you must 
But there's always a line you don't cross 
Time is short 
Don't be cruel 
Oh you don't know the power 
In what you're saying 
Oh ... 
And so he froze where he stood 
And he looked to the ground 
And he cried 
He cried 
People where 
I come from 
They survive without feelings or blood 
I never could 
Was stoned to death 
But I'm still living 
So he froze where he stood 
And he looked to the ground 
And he cried 
He cried 
So he froze 
And he looked, and he looked 
To the ground 
And he cried 
He cried

 

SORROW WILL COME IN THE END

Legalized theft 
Leaves me bereft 
I get it straight in the neck 
(Somehow expecting no less) 
A court of justice 
With no use for Truth 
Lawyer ...liar 
Lawyer ...liar 
You pleaded and squealed 
And you think you've won 
But Sorrow will come 
To you in the end 
And as sure as my words are pure 
I praise the day that brings you pain 
Q.C.'s obsessed with sleaze 
Frantic for Fame 
They're all on the game 
They just use a different name 
You lied 
And you were believed 
By a J.P. senile and vile 
You pleaded and squealed 
And you think you've won 
But Sorrow will come 
To you in the end 
And as sure as my words are pure 
I praise the day that brings you pain 
So don't close your eyes 
Don't close your eyes 
A man who slits throats 
Has time on his hands 
And I'm gonna get you 
So don't close your eyes 
Don't ever close your eyes 
You think you've won 
OH NO

 

SATAN REJECTED MY SOUL

Satan rejected my soul 
He knows my kind 
He won't be dragged down 
He's seen my face around 
He knows Heaven doesn't seem 
To be my home 
So I must find 
Somewhere else to go 
So I must find 
Somewhere else to go 
So, take it - please 
It's free 
You'll never see 
You'll never see 
All the fun in life it's cost me 
Satan rejected my soul 
As low as he goes 
He never quite goes this low 
He's seen my face around 
He knows Heaven doesn't seem 
To be my home 
So I must find 
Somewhere else to go 
So I must find 
Somewhere else to go 
So, take it please 
It's really sly 
Come on, come on, ah Come on, come on, come on 
Take it please, It's really sly 
Come on, come on, ah Come on, come on, come on 
Call me in, Pull me in, call me in 
Come on, come on, oh Come on, come on, come on 
Pull me in, pull me in, Call me in, haul me in, pull me in 
Come on, come on, ah, Come on, come on 
La la la la la, Oh ...

 
 REEL AROUND THE FOUNTAIN

It's time the tale was told
of how you took a child
and you made him old
Reel around the fountain
slap me on the patio
I'll take it now
Fifteen minutes with you
well, I wouldn't say no
people said that you were virtually dead
and they were so wrong
fifteen minutes with you
well, i wouldn't say no
people said that you were easily led
and they were half-right
I dreamt about you last night
and i fell out of bed twice
you can pin and mount me like a butterfly
but take me to the haven of your bed
was something that you never said
two lumps, please
you're the bee's knees
but so am I
Meet me at the fountain
shove me on the patio
I'll take it slowly
Fifteen minutes with you
oh I wouldn't say no
people see no worth in you
oh but I do

 

YOU'VE GOT EVERYTHING NOW

As merry as the days were long
I was right and you were wrong
back at the old grey school
I would win and you would lose
But you've got everything now
and what a terrible mess I've made of my life
No, I've never had a job
because I've never wanted one
I've seen you smile
but I've never really heard you laugh
So who is rich and who is poor?
I cannot say...
You are your mother's only son
and you're a desperate one
But I don't want a lover
I just want to be seen in the back of your car
A friendship sadly lost?
Well, this is true ...and yet, it's false
Did I ever tell you , by the way
I never did like your face
But you've got everything now
and what a terrible mess I've made of my life
No, I've never had a job
because I'm too shy
But I don't want a lover
I just want to be tied to the back of your car.

 

MISERABLE LIE

So, goodbye
please stay with your own kind
and I'll stay with mine
There's something against us
it's not time
So, goodbye
I know I hardly say
how much I love your casual way
but please put your tongue away
a little higher and we're well away
the dark nights are drawing in
and your humour is as black as them
I look at yours, you laugh at mine
and"love" is just a miserable lie
you have destroyed my flower like-life
not once-but twice
you have corrupt my innocent mind
not once-but twice
I know that wind-swept mystical air
it means: I'd like to see your underwear
I recognise that mystical air
it means: I'd like to see your underwear
what do we get for the trouble and pain?
just a rented room in Whalley Range
into the depths of the criminal world
I followed her...
I need advice, I need advice
because nobody ever looks at me twice
I'm just a country-mile behind
the world
I'm just a country mile behind
the whole world
so take me when you go

 

PRETTY GIRLS MAKE GRAVES

Upon the sand,upon the bay
"there is a quick and easy way" you say
before you illustrate
I'd rather state:
"I'm not the man you think I am
I'm not the man you think I am "
And Sorrow's native son
he will not smile for anyone
And pretty girls makes the graves
End of the pier, end of the bay
you tug my arm and say:"Give into lust,
give up to lust, oh heaven knows we'll
soon be dust..."
But I'm not the man you think I am
I'm not the man you think I am
And Sorrow's native son
he will not rise for anyone
And pretty girls make graves
I could have been wild and I could have been free
but Nature played this trick on me
She wants it Now
and she will not wait
but she's too rough
and I'm too delicate
Then on the sand
another man, he takes her hand
and a smile lights up her stupid face
(and well, it would)
I lost my faith in Womanhood
I lost my faith in Womanhood, I lost my faith

 

THE HAND THAT ROCKS THE CRADLE

Please don't cry
the ghost and the storm outside
will not invade this sacred shire
nor infiltrate your mind
my life down I shall lie
if the bogey-man should try
to play tricks on your sacred mind
to tease, torment and tantalise
wavering shadows loom
a piano plays in an empty room
there'll be blood on the cleaver tonight
when darkness lifts and the room is bright
I'll still be by your side
for you are all that matters
and I'll love you till the day I die
there never need to be longing in your eyes
as long as the hand that rocks the cradle is mine
ceiling shadows shimmy by
and when the wardrobe towers like a beast of prey
there's a sadness in your beautiful eyes
you're untouched, unsoiled, wonderous eyes
my life down I shall lie
should restless spirts try
to play tricks on you sacred mind
but whom I never gave a name
I just looked into his wonderous eyes
and said" never never never again"
all too soon I did return
just like a moth to a flame
so rattle my bones all over the stones
because I'm only a beggar-man whom nobody owns
see how words as old as sin
fit me like a glove I'm here and here I'll stay
together we lie, together we pray
there never need be longing in your eyes
as long as the hand that rocks the cradle is mine

 

STILL ILL

I decree today that life
is simply taking and not giving
England is mine and it owes me a living
ask me why, and I'll spit in your eye
ask me why, and I'll spit in your eye
but we cannot cling to the old dreams anymore
no, we cannot cling to the old dreams anymore
Does the body rule the mind
or does the mind rule the body?
I dunno...
Under the iron bridge we kissed
and although I ended up with sore lips
it just wasn't like the old days anymore
no, it wasn't like those days
am I still ill?
Does the body rule the mind
or does the mind rule the body ?
I dunno...
Ask me why, and I'll die
ask me why, and I'll die
and if you must go to work tomorrow
well, if I were you I wouldn't bother
for there are brighter sides to life
and I should know because I've seen them
but not very often...
under the iron bridge we kissed
and although I ended up with sore lips
it just wasn't like the old days anymore
no, it wasn't like those days
am I still ill?

 

HAND IN GLOVE

Hand in glove
the sun shines out of our behinds
no, it's not like any other love
this one is different-because it's us
Hand in glove
we can go wherever we please
and everything depends upon
how near you stand to me
And if the people stare
then the people stare
I really don't know and I really don't care
Hand in glove
the Good People laugh
yes, we may be hidden by rags
but we have something they'll never have
So, hand in glove I stake my claim
I'll fight to the last breath
If they dare touch a hair on your head
I'll fight to the last breath
The Good Life is out there, somewhere
so stay on my arm, you little charmer
But I know my luck too well
and I'll probably never see you again.

 

WHAT DIFFERENCE DOES IT MAKE?

All men have secrets and here is mine
so let it be known
we have been through hell and high tide,
I can surely rely on you?
and yet you start to recoil,
heavy words are so lightly thrown
but still I'd leap in front of a flying bullet for you
So, what difference does it make?
so, what difference does it make?
it makes none
but you have gone
and you must be looking very old tonight
The devil will find work for idle hands to do
I stole and I lied, and why?
because you asked me to!
but now you make feel so ashamed
because I've only got two hands
well, I'm still fond of you
So, what difference does it make?
so, what difference does it make?
it makes none
but you have gone
and your prejudice won't keep you warm tonight
So, no more apologies
no more apologies
I'm too tired
I'm too sick and tired
and I'm feeling very sick and ill today
But I'm still fond of you

 

I DON'T OWE YOU ANYTHING

Bought on stolen wine
a nod was the first step
you know very well
what was coming next
did I really walk all this way
just to hear you say
"oh I don't want to go out tonight"
but you will
for you must
I don't owe you anything
but you owe me something
repay me now
you should never go to them
let them come to you
just like I do
you should not go to them
let them come to you
just like I do
Too freely on your lips
words prematurely said
oh but I know what will make you smile tonight
Life is never kind
life is never kind
oh but I know what will make you smile tonight

 

SUFFER LITTLE CHILDREN

Over the moors,take me to the moors
dig a shallow grave
and I'll lay me down
Lesley-Anne, with your pretty white beads
oh John, you'll never be a man
and you'll never see your home again
oh Manchester, so much to answer for
Edward, see those alluring lights?
tonight will be your very last night
a woman said "I know my son is dead
I'll never rest my hands on his scared head"
Hindley wakes and Hindley says:
"Wherever he has gone, I have gone "
But fresh lilaced moorland fields
cannot hide the stoild stench of death
Hindley wakes and Hindley says:
"Whatever he has done, I have done"
But this is no easy ride
for a child cries
"find me...find me, nothing more
we're on a sullen misty moor
we may be dead and we may be gone
but we will be right by your side
until the day you die
this is no easy ride
we will haunt you when you laugh
yes, you could say we're a team
you might sleep
BUT YOU WILL NEVER DREAM!"
Oh Manchester, so much to answer for
Oh Manchester, so much to answer for
Over the moor, I'm on the moor
the child is on the moor

 

THE HEADMASTER RITUAL

Belligerent ghouls
run Manchester schools
spineless swines
cemented mines
Sir leads the troops
jealous of youth
same old suit since 1962
he does the military two-step
down the nape of my neck
I wanna go home
I don't want to stay
give up education
is a bad mistake
mid-week on the playing fields
Sir thwacks you on the knees
knees you in the groin
elbow in the face
I wanna go home
I don't want to stay
Belligerent ghouls
run Manchester schools
spineless bastards all
Sir leads the troops
jealous of youth
same old jokes since 1902
he does the military two-step
down the nape of my neck
I wanna go home
I don't want to stay
give up life
as a bad mistake
please excuse me from gym
I've got this terrible cold coming on
he grabs and devours
he kicks me in the showers
kicks me in the showers
and he grabs and devours
I wanna go home
I don't want to stay

 

RUSHOLME RUFFIANS

The last night at the fair
by the big wheel generator
a boy is stabbed
and his money is grabbed
and the air hangs heavy like a dulling wine
she is famous
she is funny
an engagement ring
doesn't mean a thing
to a mind consumed by brass(money)
and though I walk home alone
my faith in love is still devout
the last night at the fair
from a seat on a whirling waltzer
her skirt ascends for a watching eye
it's a hideous trait( on her mother's side)
and though I walk home alone
my faith in love is still devout
then someone falls in love
and someone's beaten up
and the senses being dulled are mine
and someone falls in love
someone's beaten up
and the senses being dulled are mine
and though I walk home alone
my faith in love is still devout
this is the last night of the fair
and the grease in the hair
of a speedway operator
is all a tremulous heart requires
a schoolgirl is denied
she said "How quickly would I die
if I jumped from the top of the parachutes?"
this is the last night of the fair
and the grease in the hair

scratch my name on your arm with a fountain pen
(this means you really love me)

I WANT THE ONE I CAN'T HAVE

On the day that your mentality
catches up with your biology
I want the one I can't have
and it's driving me mad
it's written all over my face
A double-bed
and a stalwart lover, for sure
these are the riches of the poor
A double-bed
and a stalwart lover, for sure
these are the riches of the poor
a tough kid who sometimes swallows nails
raised on Prisoner's Aid
he killed a policeman when he was thirteen
and somehow that really impressed me
it's written all over my face
On the day that your mentality
catches up with your biology
And if you ever need self-validation
just meet me in the alley by the
railway-station
it's written all over my face

 

WHAT SHE SAID

What she said:
"How come someone hasn't noticed
that I'm dead
and decided to bury me
God knows, I'm ready"
What she said was
but then, all the rejection she's had
to pretend to be happy
could only be idiocy
What she said was not for the job or
lover that she never had
What she read
all heady books
she'd sit and prophesise
(it took a tattoed boy from Birkenhead
to really really open her eyes)

THAT JOKE ISN'T FUNNY ANYMORE

Park the car at the side of the road
you should know
time's tide will smother you
and I will too
when you laugh about other people who feel so
very lonely
their only desire is to die
well I'm afraid
it doesn't make me smile
I wish I could laugh
but that joke isn't funny anymore
it's too close to home and it's too near the bone
it's too close to home and it's too near the bone
more than you'll ever know
It was dark as I drove the point home
and on cold leather seats
well, it suddenly struck me
I just might die with a smile on my
face after all
I've seen this happen in other people's lives
and now it's happening in mine

 

NOWHERE FAST

I'd like to drop my trousers to the world
I am a man of means(of slender means)
each household appliance
is like a new science in my town
and if a day came when I felt a natural emotion
I'd get such a shock I'd probably jump in the ocean
and when a train goes by
it's such a sad sound
I'd like to drop my trousers to the Queen
every sensible child will know what this means
the poor and the needy
are selfish and greedy on her terms
and if the day came when I felt a natural emotion
I'd get such a shock I'd probably jump in the ocean
and when a train goes by
it's such a sad song
And when I'm lying in my bed
I think about life
and I think about death
and neither one particularly appeals to me
and if the day came when I felt a natural emotion
I'd get such a shock I'd probably lie
in the middle of the street and die
I'd lie down and die

 

WELL I WONDER

Well I wonder
do you hear me when you sleep?
I hoarsely cry
Well I wonder
do you see me when we pass?
I half-die
Please keep me in mind
please keep me in mind
Gasping-but somehow still alive
this is the fierce last stand of all I am
Gasping-dying-but somehow still alive
this is the final stand of all I am
Please keep me in mind

 

BARBARISM BEGINS AT HOME

Unruly boys
who will not grow up
must be taken in hand
Unruly girls
who will not settle down
they must be taken in hand
A crack on the head
is what you get for not asking
and a crack on the head
is what you get for asking

 

MEAT IS MURDER

Heifer whines could be human cries
closer comes the screaming knife
this beautiful creature must die
this beautiful creature must die
a death for no reason
and death for reason is MURDER
and the flesh you so fancifully fry
is not succulent, tasty or nice
it's death for no reason
and death for no reason is MURDER
and the calf that you carve with a smile
is MURDER
and the turkey you festively slice
is MURDER
do you know how animals die?
kitchen aroma aren't very homely
it's not "comforting," "cheery" or kind
it's sizzling blood and the unholy stench
of MURDER
it's not "natural," "normal" or kind
the fleas you so fancifully fry
as you savour the flavour
of MURDER
NO, NO, NO, IT'S MURDER
NO, NO, NO, IT'S MURDER
who hears when animals cry?

 

THE QUEEN IS DEAD

Farewell to this lands cheerless marches
hemmed in like a boar between arches
her very Lowness with her head in a sling
Im truely sorry-but it sounds like a wonderful thing
dear Charles, dont you ever crave
to appear on the front of the Daily mail
dressed in your Mother's bridal veil?
So, I checked all the registered historical facts
and I was shocked into shame to discover
how Im the 18th pale descendent
of some, old queen or other
has the world changed, or have I changed?
has the world changed, or have I changed?
as some 9-year old tough peddles drugs
(I never even knew what drugs were)
And so, I broke into the Palace
with a sponge and a rusty spanner
she said: "Eh, I know you, and you cannot sing"
I said: "that's nothing -you should hear me play piano"
We can go for a walk where it's quiet and dry
and we can talk about precious things
but when you are tied to your mother's apron
not one talks about castration
We can go for a walk where it's quiet and dry
and we can talk about precious things
like love and law and poverty
these are the things that kill me
We can go for a walk where it's quiet and dry
and we can talk about precious things
but the rain that flattens my hair
theses are the things that kill me
Passed the Pub that saps your body
and the church who'll snatch your money
the Queen is dead, boys
and it's so lonely on a limb
Pass the Pub that wrecks your body
and the church-all they want is your money
the Queen is dead, boys`
you can trust me, boys
life is very long, when you're lonely
life is very long, when you're lonely...

 

FRANKLY MR.SHANKLY

Frankly, Mr Shankly, this position Ive held
it pays my way, but it corrodes my soul
I want to leave you will not miss me
I want to go down in musical history
Frankly, Mr Shankly, Im a sickening wreck
Ive got the 21st Century breathing down my neck
I must move fast, you understand me
I want to go down in celluloid history
Fame, Fame, fatal Fame
it can play hideous tricks on the brain
but still I rather be Famous
than righteous or holy, any day
but sometimes Id feel more fulfilled
making Christmas cards with the mentally ill
I want to Live and I want to Love
I want to catch something that I might be ashamed of
Frankly, Mr Shankly, this position I've held
it pays my way and it corrodes my soul
oh, I didnt realise that you wrote poetry
(I didnt realise you wrote such bloody awful poetry)
Frankly, Mr Shankly, since you ask
you are a flatulent pain the arse
I do not mean to be so rude
but still, I must speck frankly, Mr Shankly

 

I KNOW IT'S ALL OVER

Oh Mother, I can fell the soil falling over my head
and as i climb into an empty bed
Oh well, Enough said
I know it's over-still I cling
I don't know where else I can go
Oh Mother, I can feel the soil falling over my head
see, the sea want s to take me
the knife wants to cut me
do you think you can help me?
Sad veiled bride, please be happy
handsome groom, give her room
loud, loutish lover, treat her kindly
(although she needs you
more than she loves you)
and I know it's over
and it never really began
but in my heart it was so real
and you even spoke to me and said:
"If you're so funny
then why are you on your own tonight?
and if you are so clever
then why are you on your own tonight?
if you're so terribly good looking
then why do you sleep alone tonight?
because tonight is just like any other night
that's why you're on your own tonight
with your triumphs and your charms
while they are in each other's arms.."
It's so easy to laugh
it's so easy to hate
it takes strength to be gentle and kind
It's so easy to laugh
it's so easy to hate
it takes guts to be gentle and kind
love is Natural and Real
but not for you, my love
not tonight my love
love is Natural and Real
but not for such as you and I, my love
Oh Mother, I can fell the soil falling over my head
Oh Mother, I can fell the soil falling over my head...

 

NEVER HAD NO ONE EVER

When you walk without ease
on these
the very streets where you were raised
I had a really bad dream
it lasted 20 years, 7 months, and 27 days
Never had no one ever.

 

CEMETERY GATES

A dreaded sunny day
so I meet you at the cemetry gates
Keats and Yeats are on your side
A dreaded sunny day
so I meet you at the cemetry gates
Keats and Yeats are on your side
while Wilde is on mine
So we go inside and we gravely read the stones
all those people all those lives
where are they now ?
with loves, and hates
and passions just like mine
they were born
and then they lived and then they died
which seems so unfair
and I wantr to crv
You say: "ere thrice the sun hath done salutation to the dawn"
and you claim these words as your own
but Im well-read, have heard them said
a hundred times (maybe less, maybe more)
if you must write prose/poems
the words you use should be your own
dont plagiarise or take "on loans"
there's alweays someone, somewhere
with a big nose, who knows
and who trips you up and laughs
when you fall
You say: "ere long done do does did "
words which could only be your own
you then produce the text
from whence was ripped
(some dizzy whore, 1804)
A dreaded sunny day
so let's go where we're happy
so I meet you at the cemetry gates
Keats and Yeats are on your side
A dreaded sunny day
so let's go where we're wanted
so I meet you at the cemetry gates
Keats and Yeats are on your side
but you lose
because Wilde is on mine

 

BIGMOUTH STRIKES AGAIN

Sweetness, sweetness I was only joking
when I said Id like to smash every tooth
in your head
Sweetness, sweetness I was only joking
when I said by right s you should be
bludgeoned in your bed
and now I know how Joan of Arc felt
now I know how Joan of Arc felt
as the flames roseto her roman nose
and her Walkman stared to melt
Bibmouth, bigmouth
bigmouth strikes again
and Ive got no right to take my place
with the Human race
and now I know how Joan of Arc felt
now I know of Joan of Arc felt
as the flames rose to her roman nose
and her hearing aid started to melt
Bigmouth, bigmouth
bigmouth strikes again
and Ive got no right to take my place
with the Human race

 

THE BOY WITH A THORN IN HIS SIDE

The boy with the thorn in his side
behind the hatred there lies
a murderous desire for love
how can they look into my eyes
and still they dont believe me
how can they hear me say those words
and still they dont believe me
and if they don't believe me now
will they ever believe me?
and if they don't believe me now
will they ever believe me?
The boy with the thorn in his side
behind the hatred there lies
a plundering desire for love
how can they see the Love in our eyes
and still they don't believe us
and after all this time
they don't want to believe us
and if they dont believe us now
will they ever believe us ?
andd when you want to Live
how do you start ?
where do you go ?
who do you know?

 

VICAR IN A TUTU

I was minding mind business
lifting some lead off
the roof of the Holy Name church
it was worthwhile living a laughable life
just to set my eyes on a blistering sight
of a vicar in a tu-tu
he's not strange
he just wants to live his life this way
a scanty bit of a thing
with a decorative ring
that wouldn't cover the head of a child
as Rose collects the money in the cannister
who comes sliding down the bannister
the vicar in a tu-tu
he's not strange
he just wants to live his life this way
the monkish monsignor
with a head full of plaster
said "my man, get your vile soul dry-cleaned"
as Rose counts the money in the cannister
as natural as rain
he dances again
vicar in a tu-tu
The next day in the pulpit
with Freedom and Ease
combating ignoranca,dust and disease
as Rose counts the money in the cannister
as natural as rain
he dances again
the fabric of a tu-tu
any man could get us to
and I am a living sign.

 

THERE IS A LIGHT THAT NEVER GOES OUT

Take me out tonight
where there's music and there's people
who are young and alive
driving in your car
I never never want to go home
because I havent got one
anymore
take me out tonight
because I want to see people and I
want to see lights
driving in your car
oh please dont drop me home
because it's not my home, it's their
home, and Im welcome no morw
and if a double-decker bus
crashes in to us
to die by your side
such a heavenly way to die
and if a ten ton truck
kills the both of us
to die by your side
the pleasure and the privilege is mine
take me out tonight
oh take me anywhere, I dont care
and in the darken underpass
I thought Oh God, my chance has come at last
(but then a strange fear gripped me and I just couldn't ask)
take me out tonight
take me anywhere, I dont care
just driving in your car
I never never want to go home
because I havent got one
I havent got one.

 

SOME GIRLS ARE BIGGER THAN OTHERS

From the ice-age to the dole-age
there is but one concern
and I have just discover
some girls are bigger than others
some girls are bigger than others
some girls mothers are bigger than
other girls mothers
As Anthony said to Cleopatra
as he opened a crate of ale:
some girls are bigger than others
some girls are bigger than others
some girls mothers are bigger than
other girls mothers.

 

A RUSH AND A PUSH AND AND THE LAND IS OURS

HELLO
I am the ghost of Troubled Joe
hung by his pretty white neck
some eighteen months ago
I travelled to a mystical time zone
but I missed my bed
so I soon came home
they said:
"there's too much caffeine
in your bloodstream
and a lack of real spice
in your life"
I said:
"leave me alone
because I'm alright, dad
just surprised to still
be on my own...."
Ooh, but don't mention love
I'd hate the real strain of the pain again
a rush and a push and the land that
we stand on is ours
it has been before
so it shall be again
and people who are uglier than you and I
they take what they need, and leave
Ooh, but don't mention love
I'd hate the pain and the strain all over again
a rush and a push and the land that
we stand on is ours
it has been before
so why can't it be now?
and people who are weaker than you and I
they take what they want from life
Ooh, but don't mention love
no - just don't mention love!
a rush and a push and the land that
we stand on is ours
your youth may be gone
but you're still a young man
so phone me, phone me, phone me
so phone me, phone me, phone me
Ooh, I think I'm in love...
Urrgh, I think I'm in lerv

 

I STARTED SOMETHING I COULDN'T FINISH

The lanes were silent
with nothing or no one around for miles
I doused our friendly venture
with a hard-faced
three-word gesture
I started something
I forced you into a zone
and you were clearly
never meant to go
hair brushed and parted
typical me, typical me, typical me
I started something
...and now I'm not too sure
I grabbed you by the guilded beams
that's what Tradition means
and I doused another venture
with a gesture
that was...absolutely vile
I started something
forced you to a zone
and you were clearly
never meant to go
hair brushed and parted
typical me, typical me, typical me
I started something
...and now I'm not too sure
I grabbed you by the guilded beams
that's what Tradition means
and now eighteen months' hard-labour
seems...fair enough
I started something
forced you to a zone
and you were clearly
never meant to go
hair brushed and parted
typical me, typical me, typical me
I started something
and now I'm not too sure

 

DEATH OF A DISCO DANCER

The death of a disco dancer
well, it happens a lot 'round here
and if you think Peace
is a common goal
well, that goes to show
just how little you know
The death of a disco dancer
well, I'd rather not get involved
I never talk to my neighbour
I'd just rather not get involved
Love, peace and harmony?
Love, peace and harmony?
Oh, very nice, very nice, very nice, very nice
...but maybe in the next world.

 

GIRLFRIEND IN A COMA

Girlfriend in a coma, I know
I know - it's serious
Girlfriend in a coma, I know
I know - it's really serious
there wree times when I could
have 'murdered' her
(but, you know, I would hate
anything to happen to her)
NO, I DON'T WANT TO SEE HER
Do you really think
she'll pull through?
Do you really think
she'll pull through?
Girlfriend in a coma, I know
I know, it's serious
there were time when I could
have 'strangeled' her
(but, you know, I would hate
anything to happen to her)
WOULD YOU PLEASE LET ME SEE HER!
Do you really think she'll pull through?
Do you really think she'll pull through?
Let me wisper my last goodbyes
I know - IT'S SERIOUS

 

STOP ME IF YOU'VE HEARD THIS ONE BEFORE

Stop me, stop me,
stop me if you think that you've heard this one before
stop me, stop me
stop me if you think that you've heard this one before
nothing's changed
I still love you, oh I still love you
...only slightly less than I used to
I was delayed, I was way-laid
an emergency stop
I smelt the last ten seconds of life
I crashed down on the crossbar
and the pain was enough to make
a shy, bald buddhist reflect
and plan a mass-murder
who said I'd lied to her?
who said I'd lied because I never
who said I'd lied because I never
I was detained, I was restrained
he broke my spleen
he broke my knees
(and then he really laid into me)
Friday night in Out-patients
who said I'd lied to her?
who said I'd lied - because I never
who said I'd lied - because I never
Oh, so I drank one
or was it four
and when I fell on the floor
...I drank more
stop me, stop me
stop me if you think that you've heard this one before
nothing's changed
I still love you, I still love you
but only slightly
less than I used to

 

LAST NIGHT I DREAMT THAT SOMEBODY LOVED ME

Last night I dreamt
that somebody loved me
no hope - but no harm
just another false alarm
Las night I felt
real arms around me
no hope - no harm
just another false alarm
so, tell me how long
before the last one?
and tell me how long
before the right one?
this story is old - I KNOW
but it goes on
this story is old - I KNOW
but it goes on

 

UNHAPPY BIRTHDAY

I've come to wish you an unhappy birthday
I've come to wish you an unhappy birthday
because you're evil
and you lie
and if you should die
I may feel slightly sad
(but I won't cry)
Loved and lost
and some may say
when usually its Nothing
surely you're happy
it should be this way?
I say "No, I'm gonna kill my dog"
and: "May the lines sag heavy
and deep tonight XXX"
I've come to wish you an unhappy birthday
I've come to wish you an unhappy birthday
because you're evil
and you lie
and if you should die
I may feel slightly sad
(But I won't cry)
Loved and lost
some people say
when usually its Nothing
surely you're happy
it should be this way?
I said "No"
and then I shot myself
so, drink, drink, drink
and be ill tonight
from the one you left behind
from the one you left behind...

 

PAINT A VULGAR PICTURE

At the record company meeting
On their hands - a dead star
and ooh, the plans that they weave
and ooh, the sikening greed
At the record company meeting
on their hands - a dead star
the sycophantic slags all say:
"I knew him first, and I knew him well"
Re-issue! Re-package! Re-package!
Re-evaluate the songs
double-pack with a photograph
Extra Track (and a tacky badge)
A-list, playlist
"Please them, please them!"
"Please them! Please them!"
(sadly, THIS was your life)
but you could have said no
if you'd wanted to
you could have said no
if you'd wanted to
BPI, MTV, BBC
"Please them! Please them!"
(sadly this was your life)
but you could have said no
if you'd wanted to
you could have walked away
...couldn't you?
I touched you at the soundcheck
you had no real way of knowing
in my heart I bgged "please, take
me with you...
I don't care where you're going"
But to you I was faceless
I was fawning, I was boring
just a child from those ugly new houses
who could never begin to know
who could never really know
Best of? Most of?
Satiate the need
slip them into different sleeves!
Buy both, and be decieved
climber - new entry, re-entry
World tour! ("media whore")
"Please the Press in Belgium!"
(THIS was your life...)
and when it fails to recoup?
Well, maybe:
You just haven't earned it yet, baby
I walked a pace behind you at the soundcheck
you're just the same as I am
what makes most people feel happy
leads us headlong into harm
so, in my bedroom in those 'ugly new houses'
I dance my legs down to the knees
but me and my 'true love'
we will never meet again...
At the record company meeting
on their hands - at last! - a dead star!
but they cannot taint you in my eyes
no, they cannout touch you now
No, they cannot hurt you my darling
they cannot touch you now
but me and my 'true love'
will never meet again

 

DEATH AT ONE'S ELBOW

Ooh Glenn, don't come to the house tonight
Ooh, Glenn, don't come to the house tonight
because there's somebody here
who really really loves you
stay home
be bored
(it's crap, I KNOW)
Ooh, Glenn, don't come to the house tonight
Ooh, Glen, don't come to the house tonight
because there's somebody here
who'll take a hatchet to your ear
how the frustration renders me
hateful, Glenn!
don't come to the house tonight
don't come to the house tonight
because you'll slip on the
trail of my bespattered remains
and so, that's why
GOODBYE MY LOVE, GOODBYE MY LOVE, GOODBYE MY LOVE...
Belch

 

I WON'T SHARE YOU

I won't share you
I won't share you
with the drive and ambition
and the zeal I feel
this is my time
as the note I wrote
was read, she said
has the Perrier gone
straight to my head
or is life plainly sick and cruel, instead?
"YES!"
No-no-no-no-no-no
I won't share you
I won't share you
with the drive and the dreams inside
this is my time
Life tends to come and go
well, that's OK
just as long as you know
Life tends to come and go
well, that's OK
just as long as you know
I won't share you
I won't share you
with the drive and the dreams inside
this is my time, this is my time


THE QUEEN IS DEAD

Farewell to this lands cheerless marches
hemmed in like a boar between arches
her very Lowness with her head in a sling
Im truely sorry-but it sounds like a wonderful thing
dear Charles, dont you ever crave
to appear on the front of the Daily mail
dressed in your Mother's bridal veil?
So, I checked all the registered historical facts
and I was shocked into shame to discover
how Im the 18th pale descendent
of some, old queen or other
has the world changed, or have I changed?
has the world changed, or have I changed?
as some 9-year old tough peddles drugs
(I never even knew what drugs were)
And so, I broke into the Palace
with a sponge and a rusty spanner
she said: "Eh, I know you, and you cannot sing"
I said: "that's nothing -you should hear me play piano"
We can go for a walk where it's quiet and dry
and we can talk about precious things
but when you are tied to your mother's apron
not one talks about castration
We can go for a walk where it's quiet and dry
and we can talk about precious things
like love and law and poverty
these are the things that kill me
We can go for a walk where it's quiet and dry
and we can talk about precious things
but the rain that flattens my hair
theses are the things that kill me
Passed the Pub that saps your body
and the church who'll snatch your money
the Queen is dead, boys
and it's so lonely on a limb
Pass the Pub that wrecks your body
and the church-all they want is your money
the Queen is dead, boys`
you can trust me, boys
life is very long, when you're lonely
life is very long, when you're lonely...

 

PANIC

Panic on the streets of London
Panic on the streets of Birmingham
I wonder to myself
Could life ever be sane again
on the Leeds side-streets that you slip down
I wonder to myself
Hopes may rise on the Grasmeres
But Honey Pie, you're not safe here
So you run down
To the safety of the town
But there's Panic on the streets of Carlisle
Dublin, Dundee, Humberside
I wonder to myself
Burn down the Disco
Hang the blessed D.J.
Because the music that they constantly play
IT SAYS NOTHING TO ME ABOUT MY LIFE
Hang the blessed D.J.
Because the music they constantly play
On the Leeds side-streets that you slip down
On the provincial towns that you jog 'round
Hang the D.J.,. Hang the D.J.,.Hang the D.J...

 

VICAR IN A TUTU

I was minding mind business
lifting some lead off
the roof of the Holy Name church
it was worthwhile living a laughable life
just to set my eyes on a blistering sight
of a vicar in a tu-tu
he's not strange
he just wants to live his life this way
a scanty bit of a thing
with a decorative ring
that wouldn't cover the head of a child
as Rose collects the money in the cannister
who comes sliding down the bannister
the vicar in a tu-tu
he's not strange
he just wants to live his life this way
the monkish monsignor
with a head full of plaster
said "my man, get your vile soul dry-cleaned"
as Rose counts the money in the cannister
as natural as rain
he dances again
vicar in a tu-tu
The next day in the pulpit
with Freedom and Ease
combating ignoranca,dust and disease
as Rose counts the money in the cannister
as natural as rain
he dances again
the fabric of a tu-tu
any man could get us to
and I am a living sign.

 

ASK

Shyness is nice, but
Shyness can stop you
From doing all the things in life
That you'd like to
So, if there's something you'd like to try
ASK ME-I WON'T SAY "NO"-HOW COULD I?
Coyness is nice, but ,
Coyness can stop you
from saying all the things in
life that you want to
If there's something that you'd like to try
ASK ME-I WON'TSAY"NO"-HOW COULD I?
Spending warm, Summer days indoors
Writing fringhtening verse
To a buck-toothed girl in Luxembourg
ASK ME, ASK ME ,ASK ME, ASK ME, ASK ME ,ASK ME
Because if it's not Love
Then it's the Bomb
That will bring us together
Nature is a language-can't you read?
Nature is a language-can't you read?
ASK ME, ASK ME ,ASK ME, ASK ME, ASK ME ,ASK ME
Because if it's not Love
Then it's the Bomb
That will bring us together

 

MARIE'S THE NAME (HIS LATEST FLAME) / RUSHOLME RUFFIANS

Very old friend 
Came by today 
As he was telling everyone in town 
Of all the love that he'd just found 
And Marie's the name (of his latest flame) 
Talked and talked 
And I heard him say 
That she had the longest blackest hair 
Prettiest green eyes anywhere 
And Marie's the name (of his latest flame) 
The last night of the fair 
By the big wheel generator 
A boy is stabbed 
His money is grabbed 
And the air hangs heavy like a dulling wine 
She is Famous 
She is Funny 
An engagement ring 
Doesn't mean a thing 
To a mind consumed by brass (money), oh 
The last night of the fair 
From a seat on a whirling waltzer 
Her skirt ascends for a watching eye 
It's a hideous trait (on her mother's side)
From a seat on a whirling waltzer 
Her skirt ascends for a watching eye 
A hideous trait (on her mother's side) 
Then someone falls in love 
Someone's beaten up 
Someone's beaten up 
And the senses being dulled are mine 
And someone falls in love 
Someone's beaten up 
And the senses being dulled are mine 
This is the last night of the fair 
And the grease in the hair 
Of a speedway operator 
Is all a tremulous heart requires 
A schoolgirl is denied 
She said : "How quickly would I die 
If I jumped from the top of the parachutes ?"
This is the last night of the fair 
And the grease in the hair 
Of a speedway operator 
Is all a tremulous heart requires 
A schoolgirl is denied 
She said : "How quickly would I die 
Oh, if I jumped from the top of the parachutes ?"
...Oh, walk home alone 
I might walk home alone 
But my faith in love is still devout

 

THE BOY WITH THE THORN IN HIS SIDE

The boy with the thorn in his side
behind the hatred there lies
a murderous desire for love
how can they look into my eyes
and still they dont believe me
how can they hear me say those words
and still they dont believe me
and if they don't believe me now
will they ever believe me?
and if they don't believe me now
will they ever believe me?
The boy with the thorn in his side
behind the hatred there lies
a plundering desire for love
how can they see the Love in our eyes
and still they don't believe us
and after all this time
they don't want to believe us
and if they dont believe us now
will they ever believe us ?
andd when you want to Live
how do you start ?
where do you go ?
who do you know?

 

RUBBER RING / WHAT SHE SAID

Yeah! What she says : 
"How come someone hasn't noticed 
That I'm dead 
And decided to bury me ? 
God knows, I'm ready !"
La-la-la ... 
What she said was sad 
But then, all the rejection she's had 
To pretend to be happy 
Could only be idiocy 
La-la-la ... 
What she said was not for the job or 
Lover that she never had 
No no no ... 
What she read 
All heady books 
She'd sit and prophesise 
(It took a tattooed boy from 
Birkenhead 
To really really open her eyes)
What she read 
All heady books 
She'd sit and prophesise 
(It took a tattooed boy from 
Birkenhead 
To really really open her eyes)
What she said : 
"I smoke because I'm hoping for an 
Early death 
AND I NEED TO CLING TO SOMETHING !"
What she said : 
"I smoke because I'm hoping for an 
Early death 
AND I NEED TO CLING TO SOMETHING !"
No no no no ...

 

IS IT REALLY SO STRANGE?

I left the North 
I travelled South 
I found a tiny house 
And I can't help the way I feel 
Oh yes, you can kick me 
And you can punch me 
And you can break my face 
But you won't change the way I feel 
'Cause I love you, Oh ... 
And is it really so strange ? 
Oh, is it really so strange ? 
Oh, is it really so, really so strange ? 
I say NO, you say YES 
(and you will change your mind) 
I left the South 
I travelled North 
I got confused - I killed a horse 
I can't help the way I feel 
Oh yes, you can punch me 
And you can butt me 
And you can break my spine 
But you won't change the way I feel 
'Cause I love you, Oh ... 
And is it really so strange ? 
Oh, is it really so strange ? 
Oh, is it really so, really so strange ? 
I say NO, you say YES 
(But you will change your mind) 
I left the North again 
I travelled South again 
And I got confused - I killed a nun 
I CAN'T HELP THE WAY I FEEL 
(I lost my bag in Newport Pagnell) 
Why is the last mile the hardest mile ? 
My throat was dry, with the sun in my eyes 
And I realised, I realised 
I could never 
I could never, never, never, go back home again

 

CEMETERY GATES

A dreaded sunny day
so I meet you at the cemetry gates
Keats and Yeats are on your side
A dreaded sunny day
so I meet you at the cemetry gates
Keats and Yeats are on your side
while Wilde is on mine
So we go inside and we gravely read the stones
all those people all those lives
where are they now ?
with loves, and hates
and passions just like mine
they were born
and then they lived and then they died
which seems so unfair
and I wantr to crv
You say: "ere thrice the sun hath done salutation to the dawn"
and you claim these words as your own
but Im well-read, have heard them said
a hundred times (maybe less, maybe more)
if you must write prose/poems
the words you use should be your own
dont plagiarise or take "on loans"
there's alweays someone, somewhere
with a big nose, who knows
and who trips you up and laughs
when you fall
You say: "ere long done do does did "
words which could only be your own
you then produce the text
from whence was ripped
(some dizzy whore, 1804)
A dreaded sunny day
so let's go where we're happy
so I meet you at the cemetry gates
Keats and Yeats are on your side
A dreaded sunny day
so let's go where we're wanted
so I meet you at the cemetry gates
Keats and Yeats are on your side
but you lose
because Wilde is on mine

 

LONDON

Smoke
Lingers 'round your fingers
Train
Heave on - to Euston
Do you think you've made
The right decision this time?
You left
Your tired family grieving
And you think they're sad because you're leaving
But didn't you see the Jealousy in the eyes
Of the ones who had to stay behind?
And do you think you've made
The right decision thins time?
You left
Your girlfriend on the platform
With thei really ragged notion that you'll return
But she knows
That when he goes
He really goes
So do you think you've made
The right decision this time?

 

I KNOW IT'S OVER

I can feel the soil falling over my head 
And as I climb into an empty bed 
Oh well. Enough said. 
I know it's over - still I cling 
I don't know where else I can go 
Over ... 
Oh Mother, I can feel the soil falling over my head 
See, the sea wants to take me 
The knife wants to cut me 
Do you think you can help me ? 
Sad veiled bride, please be happy 
Handsome groom, give her room 
Loud, loutish lover, treat her kindly 
(Though she needs you 
More than she loves you) 
And I know it's over - still I cling 
I don't know where else I can go 
Over, it's over, it's over, it's over 
It's over, la ... 
I know it's over 
And it never really began 
But in my heart it was so real
And you even spoke to me, and said : 
"If you're so funny 
Then why are you on your own tonight ? 
And if you're so clever 
Then why are you on your own tonight ? 
I know ... 
'Cause tonight - it's just like any other night 
That's why you're on your own tonight 
Your triumphs and your charms 
While they're in each other's arms..."
It's so easy to laugh 
It's so easy to hate 
It takes strength to be gentle and kind 
Over, over, over, over 
It's so easy to laugh 
It's so easy to hate 
It takes guts to be gentle and kind 
Over, over 
Love is Natural and Real 
But not for you, my love 
Not tonight, my love 
Love is Natural and Real 
But not for such as you and I, my love 
Oh Mother, I can feel the soil falling over my head...
Oh Mother, I can feel the soil fall over, fall over my head 
Oh Mother, I can feel the ... fall over my ... , Oh ...

 

THE DRAIZE TRAIN

A vastly superior version of the instrumental B-side, acting as a peace 
offering to Marr (Morrissey chose the tracks for the compilation, 
and of course, receives no royalties on this track).

 

STILL ILL

I decree today that life
is simply taking and not giving
England is mine and it owes me a living
ask me why, and I'll spit in your eye
ask me why, and I'll spit in your eye
but we cannot cling to the old dreams anymore
no, we cannot cling to the old dreams anymore
Does the body rule the mind
or does the mind rule the body?
I dunno...
Under the iron bridge we kissed
and although I ended up with sore lips
it just wasn't like the old days anymore
no, it wasn't like those days
am I still ill?
Does the body rule the mind
or does the mind rule the body ?
I dunno...
Ask me why, and I'll die
ask me why, and I'll die
and if you must go to work tomorrow
well, if I were you I wouldn't bother
for there are brighter sides to life
and I should know because I've seen them
but not very often...
under the iron bridge we kissed
and although I ended up with sore lips
it just wasn't like the old days anymore
no, it wasn't like those days
am I still ill?

 

BIGMOUTH STRIKES AGAIN

Sweetness, sweetness I was only joking
when I said Id like to smash every tooth
in your head
Sweetness, sweetness I was only joking
when I said by right s you should be
bludgeoned in your bed
and now I know how Joan of Arc felt
now I know how Joan of Arc felt
as the flames roseto her roman nose
and her Walkman stared to melt
Bibmouth, bigmouth
bigmouth strikes again
and Ive got no right to take my place
with the Human race
and now I know how Joan of Arc felt
now I know of Joan of Arc felt
as the flames rose to her roman nose
and her hearing aid started to melt
Bigmouth, bigmouth
bigmouth strikes again
and Ive got no right to take my place
with the Human race

 
ALSATIAN COUSTIN

Were you and he Lovers?
and would you say so if you were?
on a forecourt
on a Friday
passing my way
Were you and he Lovers?
and if you were, then say that you were!
on a groundsheet
under canvas
with your tent-flap
open wide
A note upon his desk:
"P.S. Bring Me Home And Have Me!"
Leather elbows on a tweed coat
- Oh! -
Is THAT the best you can do?
So came his reply:
"...but on the desk is where I want you!"
So I ask (even though I know):
were you and he Lovers?

 

LITTLE MAN, WHAT NOW?

An afternoon nostalgia
television show
you spoke in silhouette
(but they couldn't name you)
although the panel were
very polite to you
but I remembered you
from Friday nights 1969
ATV - you murdered every line
too old to be a child star
too young to take leads
four seasons passed
and they AXED you
nervously juvenile
(WON'T SMILE!)
What became of you?
did that swift eclipse torture you?
a star at eighteen
and then-suddenly gone
down to a few lines
in the back page of a teenage annual
oh but I remembered you
I looked up to you

 

EVERYDAY IS LIKE SUNDAY

Trudging slowly over wet sand
back to the bench
where your clothes were stolen
this is the coastal town
that they forgot to close down
Armageddon - come Armageddon!
Come Armageddon! Come!
Everyday is like Sunday
everyday is silent and grey
Hide on the promenade
scratch out a postcard
"how I dearly with I was not here"
in the seaside town
...that they forgot to bomb
Come! Come! Come - nuclear bomb!
Everyday is like Sunday
everyday is silent and grey
Trudging back over pebbles and sand
and a strange dust lands on your hands
(and on your face)
Everyday is like Sunday
"Win Yourself A Cheap Tray"
share some greased tea with me
everyday is silent and grey

 

BENGALI IN PLATFORMS

No no no
he does not want to depress you
oh no no no no no
he only wants to impress you
Bengali in platform
she only wants to embrace your culture
and to be your friend forever
Bengali, Bengali
oh shelve your Western plans
and understand that life is hard enough when you belong here
A silver-studded rim that glistens
and an ankle-star that...blinds me
a lemon sole so very high
which only reminds me, to tell you
so I break the news gently
I break the news to you gently
"Shelve your plans"
Bengali, Bengali
its the touchy march of time
that blinds you
don't blame me
don't hate me
just because I'm the one to tell you
that life is hard enough when you belong here
life is hard enough when you belong here
shelve your western plans
life is hard enough when you belong here

 

ANGEL, ANGEL, DOWN WE GO TOGETHER

Angel, Angel
don't take your life tonight
I know they take
and that they take in turn
and they give you nothing real
for yourself in return
and when they've used you
and they've broken you
and wasted all your money
and cast your shell aside
and when they've bought you
and they've sold you
and they've billed you for the pleasure
and they've made your parents cry
I will be here
BELIEVE ME
I will be here
...believe me
Angel, don't take your life
some people have got no pride
they do not understand
the Urgency of life
but I love you more than life
I love you more than life
I love you more than life
I love you more than life

 

LALE NIGHT, MAUDLIN STREET

The last night on Maudlin Street
goodbye house
goodbye stairs
I was born here
I was raised here, and
...I took some stick here
love at first sight
may sound trite
but it's true, you know
I could list the details
of everything you ever wore
or said, or how you stood that day
and as we spend the last night
on Maudlin Street, I say
"goodbye house-forever!"
I never stole a happy hour
around here
Where the world's ugliest boy
became what you see
here I am - the ugliest man
Its the last night on Maudlin Street
and truly I do love you
oh, truly I do love you
When I sleep with that picture of
you framed beside my bed
oh, it's childish and it's silly
but I think it's you in my room
by the bed (...yes, I told you it was silly...)
and I know
I took strange pills
but I never meant to hurt you
oh truly I love you
I came home late one night
everyone had gone to bed
nobody stays up for you
when you have sixteen stitches
all around your head
the last buss I missed to Maudlin Street
so, he drove me home in the Van
complaining: "Women only like me for my mind..."
don't leave your torch behind
power-cuts ahead
as we crept through the park
but no I cannot steal a pair of jeans
off a clothesline for you
but you...without clothes
oh I could not keep a straight face
me - without clothes?
well a nation turns its back and gags...
I'm packed
I am moving house
a half-life disappears today
every slag waves me on
(secretly wishing me gone
well, I will be soon
oh - I will be soon)
There were bad times on Maudlin Street
when they took you away in a police car
dear Inspector - don't you know?
don't you care?
don't you know - about Love?
Your gran died
and your mother died
on Maudlin Street
in pain and ashamed
with never time to say
those special things
I took the keys from Maudlin Street
well, it's only bricks and mortar!
and...truly I do love you
wherever you are
wherever you are

 

SUEDHEAD

Why do you come here
why do you hang around
I'm so sorry
I'm so sorry
Why do you come here
when you know it makes
things hard for me
when you know, oh
why do you come?
Why do you telephone?
and why send me silly notes?
I'm so sorry
I'm so sorry
why do you come here
when you know it makes
thing hard for me
when you know, oh
why do you come?
You had to sneak into my room
'just' to read my diary
was it just to see all the things
you knew I'd written about you?
and...so many illustrations
I'm so very sickened
oh, I am so sickened NOW

 

BREAK UP THE FAMILY

The strange logic of your clumsiest line
stayed emblazoned on my mind
break up the family
and lets begin to live our lives
I went to see all my friends tonight
it wasn't Youth, it wasn't even Life
born Old, sadly wise
resigned (well, we were)
to ending our lives
I'm so glad to grow older
to move away from those awful times
I want to see all my friends tonight
Yes you found love but you weren't
at peace with your life
home late, full of Hate
despise the ties that bind
oh I'm so glad to grow older
to move away from those younger years
now I'm in love for the first time
and I don't feel bad
Let me see all my old friends
let me put my arm around them
because I really do love them
now, does that sound mad?
Captain of games, solid framed
I stood on the touchline
hailstones, driven home
in his car - no breaks? I don't mind
I'm just so glad to grow older
to move away from those darker years
I'm in love for the first time
and I don't feel bad
so wish me luck my friends
goodbye

 

HAIRDRESSER ON FIRE

Here is London
here is London
is it home of the free,
or what?
can you squeeze me
into an empty page of your diary
and psychologically save me
I've got faith in you
I sense the power
in the fingers
within an hour the power
can totally destroy me
or it could same my life
here is London
'home of the brash, outrageous
and free'
you are repressed
but you're remarkably dressed
is it Real?
but you're far to busy
busy scissors
busy clippers
hair dresser on fire
all around Sloane Square
and you're far too busy
to see me
"busy,busy"
hairdresser on fire
was a client over-cautious
he made you nervous
and when he said
"I'm gonna sue you"
I really felt for you
so can you squeeze me
into an empty page of your diary
and supernaturally change me
CHANGE ME, CHANGE ME

 

THE ORDINARY BOYS

Ordinary boys, happy knowing nothing
happy being no one, but themselves
Ordinary girls, supermarket clothes
who think it's very clever to be cruel to you
for you were so different
you stood all alone
and you knew
that it had to be so
avoiding ordinary boys
happy going nowhere, just around here
in their rattling cars
and ordinary girls
never seeing further
than the cold, small streets
that trap them
but you were so different
you had to say no
when those empty fools
tried to change you, and claim you
for the lair of their ordinary world
where they feel so lucky
so lucky, so lucky
with their lives laid out before them
they're so lucky, so lucky
so lucky, so lucky

 

I DON'T MIND IF YOU FORGET ME

I don't mind
I don't mind if you forget me
having learned my lesson
I never left an impression on anyone
so now you send me your hardened 'regards'
when once you'd send me 'love'
sincerely I must tell you
your mild 'best wishes'
they make me suspicious
but I don't mind
I don't mind if you forget me
having learned my lesson
I never left
an impression on anyone
the pressure to change, to move on
was strange
and very strong
so this is why I tell you
I really do understand
BYE BYE
I don't mind if you forget me
no no no no no no no
REJECTION IS ONE THING
BUT REJECTION FROM A FOOL
IS CRUEL
REJECTION IS ONE THING
BUT REJECTION FROM A FOOL
IS CRUEL
and I don't mind if you forget me
I don't mind if your forget me

 

DIAL-A-CLICHE

Further into the fog I fall
well, I was just
following you!
when you said:
"Do as I do and scrap your fey ways"
(dial-a-cliche)
"grow up, be a man, and close your mealy-mouth!"
(dial-a-cliche)
But the person underneath
where does he go?
does he slide by the wayside?
or...does he just die?
when you find that you've organized
your feelings, for people
who didn't like you then
and certainly don't like you now
yet still you say:
"Do as I do and scrap your fey ways"
(dial-a-cliche)
"grow up, be a man, and close your mealy-mouth!"
(dial-a-cliche)
"the Safe way is the only way!
there's always time to change, son!"
yes well I've changed
but I'm in pain!
dial-a-chiche

 

MARGARET ON THE GUILLOTINE

The kind people
have a wonderful dream
Margaret on the guillotine
because people like you
make me feel so tired
when will you die?
when will you die?
when will you die?
when will you die?
when will you die?
because people like you
make me feel so old inside
please die
and kind people
do not shelter this dream
make it real
make the dream real
make the dream real
make it real

 

OUR FRANK

Our frank and open
deep conversations
they get me nowhere
they bring me down, so
give it a rest, won't you?
give me a cigarette
God give me patience
just no more conversation
Give us a drink
and make it quick
or else I'm gonna be sick
sick all over
your frankly vulgar
red pullover
now see how the colours blend
Our frank and open
deep conversations
they get me nowhere
they bring me down, so
give it a rest, won't you?
now will you just give over
the world may be ending
but look, I'm only human
Give us a drink
and make it quick
or else I'm gonna be sick
all over
your frankly vulgar
red pullover
now see how the two colours blend
Won't somebody stop me
from thinking all the time
about everything
so deeply
so bleakly

 

ASIAN RUT

Day oh so late
strangely the sun still shone
oh Asian boy
what are you on?
Day oh so late
strangely the sun still shone
what drugs are you on?
Tooled-up Asian boy
has come here to avenge
the cruel, cold killing
of his very best friend
Tooled-up Asian boy
has come here to take revenge
for the cruel, cold killing
of his only friend
Peace through the school
so quiet in the hall
it's a strange sign for one
of what's to come
Tough and hard and pale
oh they may just impale you on railings
oh English boys
it must be wrong
three against one?
Brakes slammed, and
a gun jammed, and
as far as I could tell
brave Asian boy
dealt a blow and fell
I'm just passing through here
on my way to somewhere civilised
and maybe I'll even arrive
maybe I'll even arrive?

 

SING YOUR LIFE

Sing your life
any fool can think of words that rhyme
many others do
why don't you?
do you want to?
Sing your life
just walk right up to the microphone
and name
all the things that you love
all the things that you loathe
sing your life
all the things that you love
all the things that you loathe
oh sing your life
oh sing your life
Others sang your life
but now's your chance to shine
and have the pleasure of
saying what you mean
the rare pleasure of
meaning what you sing
oh, make no mistake, my friend
all of this will end
so sing it now
all the things you love
all the things you loathe
oh sing your life
all the things that you love
all the things that you loathe
oh sing your, oh sing your
Don't leave it all unsaid
somewhere in the wasteland of your head
and make no mistake, my friend
your pointless life will end
but before you go
can you look at the truth?
You have a lovely singing voice
a lovely singing voice
and all of those
who sing on key
they stole the notion
from you and me

 

MUTE WITNESS

Your poor witness
crying so loudly on the floor
oh but she's only trying to tell you
what it was that she saw
she is only trying to tell you
what it was that she saw
Now see her standing on the table
with her small arms flailing
and you feel such compassion
in your soul for
Your poor mute witness
still testing the strength
of our patience
oh but she's only trying to tell you
what it was that she saw
Now see her pointing to the frisbee
with a memory too fuzzy
as her silent words
describe the fright of last night
4 a.m. Norhtside, Clapham Common
who knows what she was doing there?
will she sketch the answer later?
Well, I'll ask her
"now dry your tears, my dear"
Now see her mime in time so nicely
it would all have been so clear
is only she had never volunteered
"your taxi is here, my dear"

 

KING LEER

Your boyfriend, he
went down on one knee
well, could it be
he's only got one knee?
I tried to surprise you
with Vodka
or, Tizer
I can't quite remember
but you didn't thank me
you didn't even thank me
because you never do
Your boyfriend, he
has the gift of the gab
or, could it be
the gift of the grab?
I tried to surprise you
I lay down beside you
and...nothing much happened
and you didn't phone me
you didn't even phone me
because it's not your style
to dial
Your boyfriend, he
displays to me
more than just
a hint of cruelty
I tried to surprise you
I crept up behind you
with a homeless chihuahua
you gushed for an hour
you handed him back and said
"You'll never guess
I'm bored now"

 

FOUND FOUND FOUND

found found found found found found
someone who's worth it
in this murkiness
someone who's never
seeming scheming
found found found found found found
someone who's worth it
in this murkiness
someone who's never
seeming scheming
Oh, but if I'd never found
oh, but if I'd never found
oh, but if I'd never found
I do believe that
the more you give your love
and I do believe that
the more you offer trust
the more you chase
the more you cry
the more you're bound to lose
the more you're bound to lose
Oh, but if I'd never found
oh, but if I'd never found
somebody
who wants to be
who wants to be
with me
all the time

 

DRIVING YOUR GIRLFRIEND HOME

I'm driving
your girlfriend home
and she's saying
how she never chose you
"turn left", she says
so I turn left
and she says
"So how did I end up
so deeply involved in
the very existence
I planned on avoiding?"
and I can't answer
I'm driving
your girlfriend home
and she's laughing
to stop herself crying
"drive on", she says
so I drive on
and she says
"So how did I end up
attached to this person
when his sense of humour
gets gradually worser?"
and I can't tell her
I'm parking
outside her home
and we're shaking hands
goodnight, so politely

 

THE HARSH TRUTH OF THE CAMERA EYE

Churchillian legs
hair barely there
the harsh truth of the camera eye
Your eyes signal pain
because of the strain
of smiling
the harsh truth of the camera eye
telling you all
that you never wnated to know
showing what
you didn't want shown
My so friendly lens
zooms into
"the inner you"
and it tells the harsh truth
and nothing but
Laugh with us all here
that's if you can
then take the pictures home
and screamtelling you all
that you never wanted to know
showing you what
you didn't want shown
This photographer
he must have really had it in for you
"Oh, I don't want
to be judged anymore
I don't wnat to be judged
I would sooner be Loved
I would sooner be
just blindly Loved..."

 

(I'M) THE END OF THE FAMILY LINE

With no complications
fifteen generations
(of mine)
all honouring Nature
until I arrive
(with incredible style)
I'm the end fo the line
the end of the family line
the end of the line
No baby pulled screaming
out into this seething whirl
by chance or whim
(or even love?)
our family tree hacked into decline
and I'm spared the pain
of ever saying
("goodbye")
I'm the end of the line
the end of the family line
the end of the line

 

THERE'S A PLACE IN HELL FOR ME AND MY FRIENDS

There is a place
reserved
for me and my friends
and when we go
we all will go
so you see
I'm never alone
there is a place
with a bit more time
and a few more
gentler words
and looking back
we do forgive
(we had no choice
we always did)
all that we hope
is that when we go
our skin
and our blood
and our bones
don't get in your way
making you ill
the way they did
when we lived
There is a place
a place in hell
reserved
for me and my friends
and if ever I
wanted to cry
then I will
because I can

 

TONY THE PONY

Still drinking on the corner 
Just don't say I didn't warn you 
Always nagging big brother 
He's only looking out for you 
Tony The Pony 
Tony The Pony 
You're still standing on the corner 
Just don't say I didn't warn you 
Old and jealous big brother 
You had your time and you spent it 
Crying 
Now, Tony The Pony 
Tony The Pony 
So, that's what they call you now ? 
When you're free outside 
So cold and hard and in control 
And ... 
There's a free ride on 
Tony The Pony 
Oh, why do you always wanna stop me 
From doing the things in life that make me happy ? 
And when I'm outside with friends, laughing loudly 
Why do you always wanna stop me ? 
Oh, I would never 
I would never 
But you will carry the can for anyone 
The free ride on 
Gullible Tony 
You're drunker quicker 
And you're sicker even quicker 
For something heavy is gonna fall on you 
Oh ... 
And what do they call you now ? 
When you're free outside 
So cold and hard and in control 
And, oh ... been a lark 
There's a free ride on 
Fucked-up Tony 
I will never say I told you so 
Or how I knew that something bad 
Would happen to you 
I don't wanna say I told you so 
Oh, but Tony, I told you so !!! 
I told you so

 

YOU'RE GONNA NEED SOMEONE ON YOUR SIDE

With the world's fate 
Resting on your shoulder 
You're gonna need 
Someone on your side 
You can't do it by yourself 
Any longer 
You're gonna need 
Someone on your side 
Someone kindly told me 
That you'd wasted 
Eight of nine lives
Oh, give yourself a break 
Before you break down 
You're gonna need someone on your side 
And here I am, And here I am 
Well, you don't need 
To look so pleased ! 
Day or night, 
There is no difference 
You're gonna need someone on your side 
Day or night, 
There is no difference 
You're gonna need someone soon 
And here I am, And here I am 
Well, you don't need 
To look so pleased

 

GLAMOROUS GLUE

First day with the jar 
You find 
Everyone lies 
First day with the jar 
You find 
Everyone lies, nobody minds 
Everyone lies 
Where is the man you respect ? 
And where is the woman you love ? 
Where's the woman you love ? 
Third week with the jar
You find 
Everything dies 
We won't vote Conservative 
Because we never have 
Everyone lies, everyone lies 
Where is the man you respect ? 
And where is the woman you love ? 
Where's the woman you love ? 
Everything of worth 
On Earth Is there To share 
I used to dream, and I used to vow 
I wouldn't dream of it now 
We look to Los Angeles 
For the language we use 
London is dead, London is dead, London is dead...
Now I'm too much in love 
I'm too much in love 
I know 
I'll go 
Empty hand 
From the land

 

WE'LL LET YOU KNOW

How sad are we ? 
And how sad have we been ? 
We'll let you know 
We'll let you know 
Oh, but only if - you're really interested 
You wonder how 
We've stayed alive 'till now 
We'll let you know 
We'll let you know 
But only if - you're really interested 
We're all smiles 
Then, honest, I swear, it's the turnstiles 
That make us hostile 
Oh ... 
We will descend 
On anyone unable to defend 
Themselves 
Oh ... 
And the songs we sing 
They're not supposed to mean a thing 
La, la, la, la ... 
Oh ...You're lonely, Oh ... you're lonely, Oh ... 
GET OFF THE ROOF ! Oh ... 
Your Arsenal !
We may seem cold, or 
We may even be 
The most depressing people you've ever known 
At heart, what's left, we sadly know 
That we are the last truly British people you'll ever know 
We are the last truly British people you will ever know 
You'll never never want to know

 

THE NATIONAL FRONT DISCO

David, the wind blows 
The wind blows ... 
Bits of your life away 
Your friends all say ... 
"Where is our boy ? Oh, we've lost our boy" 
But they should know 
Where you've gone 
Because again and again you've explained that 
You're going to ... 
Oh, you're going to ... 
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah 
England for the English ! 
England for the English ! 
David, the winds blow 
The winds blow ...
All of my dreams away 
And I still say : 
"Where is our boy ? Ah, we've lost our boy" 
But I should know 
Why you've gone 
Because again and again you've explained
You've gone to the ... 
National, ah ... 
To the National .. 
There's a country; you don't live there 
But one day you would like to 
And if you show them what you're made of 
Oh, then you might do ... 
But David, we wonder 
We wonder if the thunder 
Is ever really gonna begin 
Begin, begin 
Your mom says : 
"I've lost my boy" 
But she should know 
Why you've gone 
Because again and again you've explained 
You've gone to the : 
National 
To the National 
To the National Front Disco 
Because you want the day to come sooner 
You want the day to come sooner 
You want the day to come sooner 
When you've settled the score 
Oh, the National 
Oh, the National

 

CERTAIN PEOPLE I KNOW

I take the cue from 
Certain people I know 
I use the cue 
And then I 
Hand it on to you 
And when I swing it 
So, it catches his eye ... 
(Weren't you there ? 
- You'd have died !) 
I trust the views of 
Certain people I know 
They look at Danger 
And they 
LAUGH THEIR HEADS OFF 
Their clothes are Imitation 
George the 23rd 
(Don't you find this absurd ?) 
I'd hate to be like 
Certain people I know 
They break their necks 
And can't afford to
Get them fixed 
Ah, they'd sacrifice all 
Of their principles for 
anything cashable 
I do believe it's terrible 
Oh, wo, wo, Ah, ah, ah, ah, Oh, wo, wo...

 

WE HATE IT WHEN OUR FRIENDS BECOME SUCCESSFUL

We hate it when our friends become successful 
We hate it when our friends become successful 
Oh, look at those clothes 
Now look at that face, it's so old 
And such a video ! 
Well, it's really laughable 
Ha, ha, ha ...
We hate it when our friends become successful 
And if they're Northern, that makes it even worse
And if we can destroy them 
You bet your life we will 
Destroy them 
If we can hurt them 
Well, we may as well ... 
It's really laughable 
Ha, ha, ha ... 
You see, it should've been me 
It could've been me 
Everybody knows 
Everybody says so 
They say : 
"Ah, you have loads of songs 
So many songs 
More songs than they'd stand 
Verse 
Chorus 
Middle eight 
Break, fade 
Just listen ..."
La, la-la, la-la

SEASICK, YET STILL DOCKED

I am a poor freezingly cold soul 
So far from where 
I intended to go 
Scavenging through life's very constant lulls 
So far from where I'm determined to go 
Wish I knew the way to reach the one I love
There is no way ... 
Wish I had the charm to attract the one I love 
But you see, I've got no charm 
Mmm...
Tonight I've consumed much more than I can hold 
Oh, this is very clear to you 
And you can tell I have never really loved 
You can tell, by the way, I sleep all day
And all of my life no-one gave me anything 
No-one has ever given me anything 
My love is as sharp as a needle in your eye 
You must be such a fool 
To pass me by

 

I KNOW IT'S GONNA HAPPEN SOMEDAY

My love, wherever you are 
Whatever you are 
Don't lose faith 
I know it's gonna happen someday 
To you 
Please wait ... Please wait ... Oh ... Wait ... 
Don't lose faith 
You say that the day just never arrives 
And it's never seemed so far away 
Still, I know it's gonna happen someday 
To you 
Please wait ... 
Don't lose faith

 

TOMORROW

Tomorrow 
Will it really come ? 
And if it does come 
Will I still be Human ? 
All I ask of you is one thing that you never do 
Would you put your arms around me ? 
(I won't tell anyone) 
Tomorrow 
Does it have to come ?
All I ask of you is one thing that you'll never do 
Would you put your arms around me ? 
(I won't tell anybody) 
Tomorrow 
And what must come before ...
Oh, the pain in my arms 
Oh, the pain in my legs 
Ooh, my shiftless body 
Tomorrow 
It's surely nearer now ? 
You don't think I'll make it 
I never said I wanted to ! 
Well did I ? 
Oh, the pain in my arms 
Oh, the pain in my legs 
Oh, yeah; oh, yeah, No, yeah; no, yeah 
Through my shiftless body 
Tomorrow, Tomorrow 
All I ask of you ... oh ... 
Is : would you tell me that you love me 
Tell me, tell me that you love me, Tell me, tell me that you love me ... 
Ah, I know you don't mean it 
Ah, I know you don't mean it 
Tell me, tell me that you love me, Tell me, tell me that you love me ...

 

YOU'RE THE ONE FOR ME, FATTY

You're the One for me, fatty 
You're the One I really, really love 
And I will stay 
Promise you'll say 
If I'm in your way
You're the One for me, fatty 
You're the One I really, really love 
And I will stay

CERTAIN PEOPLE I KNOW

I take the cue from 
Certain people I know 
I use the cue And then I 
Hand it on to you 
And when I swing it 
So, it catches his eye ... 
(Weren't you there ? 
- You'd have died !) 
I trust the views of 
Certain people I know 
They look at Danger 
And they 
LAUGH THEIR HEADS OFF 
Their clothes are Imitation 
George the 23rd 
(Don't you find this absurd ?) 
I'd hate to be like 
Certain people I know 
They break their necks 
And can't afford to
Get them fixed 
Ah, they'd sacrifice all 
Of their principles for 
anything cashable 
I do believe it's terrible 
Oh, wo, wo Ah, ah, ah, ah Oh, wo, wo...

 

THE NATIONAL FRONT DISCO

David, the wind blows 
The wind blows ... 
Bits of your life away 
Your friends all say ... 
"Where is our boy ? Oh, we've lost our boy" 
But they should know 
Where you've gone 
Because again and again you've explained that 
You're going to ... 
Oh, you're going to ... 
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah 
England for the English ! 
England for the English ! 
David, the winds blow 
The winds blow ...
All of my dreams away 
And I still say : 
"Where is our boy ? Ah, we've lost our boy" 
But I should know 
Why you've gone 
Because again and again you've explained
You've gone to the ... 
National, ah ... To the National .. 
There's a country; you don't live there 
But one day you would like to 
And if you show them what you're made of 
Oh, then you might do ... 
But David, we wonder 
We wonder if the thunder 
Is ever really gonna begin 
Begin, begin 
Your mom says : 
"I've lost my boy" 
But she should know 
Why you've gone 
Because again and again you've explained 
You've gone to the : 
National, To the National 
To the National Front Disco 
Because you want the day to come sooner 
You want the day to come sooner 
You want the day to come sooner 
When you've settled the score 
Oh, the National, Oh, the National…

 

NOVEMBER SPAWNED A MONSTER

Sleep on and dream of Love
because it's the closest you will get to love
poor twisted child, so ugly, so ugly
poor twisted child, oh hug me, oh hug me
one November spawned a monster 
in the shape of this child who later cried
"But Jesus made me, so Jesus save me from
pity, sympathy and people discussing me"
a frame of useless limbs what can make GOOD
all the BAD that's been done?
And if the lights were out
could you even bear
to kiss her full on the mouth (or anywhere?)
poor twisted child, so ugly, so ugly
poor twisted child, oh hug me, oh hug me
one November spawned a monster 
in the shape of this child who must remain
a hostage to kindess and the wheels underneath her
a hostage to kindess and the wheels underneath her
a symbol of where mad, mad lovers
must PAUSE and draw the line
So sleep and dream of love
because it's the closest
you will get to love
that November is a time which I must put OUT of my mind
oh one fine day 
LET IT BE SOON
she won't be rich or beautiful
but she'll be walking your streets
in the clothes that she went out
and chose for herself

 

SEASICK, YET STILL DOCKED

I am a poor freezingly cold soul 
So far from where 
I intended to go 
Scavenging through life's very constant lulls 
So far from where I'm determined to go 
Wish I knew the way to reach the one I love
There is no way ... 
Wish I had the charm to attract the one I love 
But you see, I've got no charm 
Mmm...
Tonight I've consumed much more than I can hold 
Oh, this is very clear to you 
And you can tell I have never really loved 
You can tell, by the way, I sleep all day
And all of my life no-one gave me anything 
No-one has ever given me anything 
My love is as sharp as a needle in your eye 
You must be such a fool 
To pass me by

 

THE LOOP

I just wanna say 
I haven't been away 
I'm still right here 
Where I always was 
So one day, if you're bored 
By all means call 
Because you can do 
(But only if you want to) 
I just wanna say 
I haven't been away 
I am still right here 
Where I always was 
So one day, when you're bored 
By all means call 
Because you can do 
But you might not get through

 

SISTER I'M A POET

All over this town 
Yes, a low wind may blow 
And I can see through everybo... 
With no reason 
To hide these words I feel 
And no reason 
To talk about the books I read 
But still I do 
That's 'cause I'm a ... Sister I'm a ... 
All over this town 
Along this way 
Outside the prison gates 
I love the romance of crime 
And I wonder 
Does anybody feel the way I do ? 
And is evil just something you are 
Or something you do ? 
Sister I'm a ... Sister I'm a ... 
All over this town, All over this town 
They pull over 
In their Citroen vans 
Not to shake your hand 
With meths on their breaths 
And you with youth on your side 
A plastic bag stranded at the lights 
This once was me ...
But now I'm a ... Sister I'm a ...
All over this town ... Oh, oh, oh 
All over this town, All over this town, Oh ... 
I still cannot speak French ... I am very lazy

 

JACK THE RIPPER

Oh, you look so tired 
Mouth slack and wide 
Ill-housed and ill-advised 
Your face is as mean 
As your life has been 
Crash into my arms 
I WANT YOU 
You don't agree -
But you don't refuse 
I know you 
And I know a place 
Where no one is likely to pass 
Oh, you don't care if it's late 
And you don't care if you're lost 
And oh, you look so tired 
(But tonight you presumed too much) 
Too much, too much 
And if it's the last 
Thing I ever do 
I'M GONNA GET YOU 
Crash into my arms 
I WANT YOU 
You don't agree -
But you don't refuse 
I know you 
And no one knows a thing about my life 
I can come and go as I please 
And if I want to, I can stay 
Oh, or if I want to, I can leave 
Nobody knows me, Nobody knows me, Nobody knows me Oh, oh...

 

SUCH A LITTLE THING MAKES SUCH A BIG DIFFERENCE

Such a little thing, such a little thing
but the difference it made was grave
there you go
wielding a bicycle chain
oh why won't you change
cange and be nicer?
such a little thing
a gentle tone of kindness
or written words on paper
- can you write?
How I love all of
the very simple things of life
(God's good air)
how I love all of
the very simple things of life
such a little thing
a fumbling politeness
the difference it saved me
wielding a bicycle chain
"I WILL NOT CHANGE AND I WILL NOT BE NICE"
Most people keep their brains between your legs (don't you find?)
Leave me alone - I was only singing, leave me alone because
I was only singing
leave me alone - I was only singing, leave me alone
you have just proved (again)
MOST PEOPLE KEEP THEIR BRAINS BETWEEN THEIR LEGS

 

I KNOW IT'S GONNA HAPPEN SOMEDAY

My love, wherever you are 
Whatever you are 
Don't lose faith 
I know it's gonna happen someday 
To you 
Please wait ... 
Please wait ... 
Oh ... Wait ... 
Don't lose faith 
You say that the day just never arrives 
And it's never seemed so far away 
Still, I know it's gonna happen someday 
To you 
Please wait ... 
Don't lose faith

 

WE'LL LET YOU KNOW

How sad are we ? 
And how sad have we been ? 
We'll let you know, We'll let you know 
Oh, but only if - you're really interested 
You wonder how 
We've stayed alive 'till now 
We'll let you know, We'll let you know 
But only if - you're really interested 
We're all smiles 
Then, honest, I swear, it's the turnstiles 
That make us hostile 
Oh ... We will descend 
On anyone unable to defend 
Themselves 
Oh ... And the songs we sing 
They're not supposed to mean a thing 
La, la, la, la ... Oh ...
You're lonely, Oh ... you're lonely 
Oh ... 
GET OFF THE ROOF !
Oh ... Your Arsenal !
We may seem cold, or 
We may even be 
The most depressing people you've ever known 
At heart, what's left, we sadly know 
That we are the last truly British people you'll ever know 
We are the last truly British people you will ever know 
You'll never never want to know

 

SUEDHEAD

Why do you come here
why do you hang around
I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry
Why do you come here
when you know it makes
things hard for me
when you know, oh
why do you come?
Why do you telephone?
and why send me silly notes?
I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry
why do you come here
when you know it makes
thing hard for me
when you know, oh
why do you come?
You had to sneak into my room
'just' to read my diary
was it just to see all the things
you knew I'd written about you?
and...so many illustrations
I'm so very sickened
oh, I am so sickened NOW

 

HE KNOWS I'D LOVE TO SEE HIM

He Knows (he knows)
Or, I think he does
because when I lived
in the Arse of the world...
he knows, he knows, he knows I'd love
to see him happy (or as close as is allowed)
because when I lived
in the Arse of the world
he knows, he knows, he knows I'd love
to see him happy (or as close as possible
as close as possible, as close as is allowed)
My name still conjours up deadly deeds
and a bad taste in the mouth
the police - they actually knew me
they said:
"You're just another person in the world
you're just another fool with radical views
you're just another who has maddening views
you want to turn it on its head
by staying in bed!"
I said: "I know I do"

 

YOU'RE GONNA NEED SOMEONE ON YOUR SIDE

With the world's fate 
Resting on your shoulder 
You're gonna need 
Someone on your side 
You can't do it by yourself 
Any longer 
You're gonna need 
Someone on your side 
Someone kindly told me 
That you'd wasted 
Eight of nine lives
Oh, give yourself a break 
Before you break down 
You're gonna need someone on your side 
And here I am, And here I am 
Well, you don't need 
To look so pleased ! 
Day or night, 
There is no difference 
You're gonna need someone on your side 
Day or night, 
There is no difference 
You're gonna need someone soon 
And here I am, And here I am 
Well, you don't need 
To look so pleased

 

GLAMOROUS GLUE

First day with the jar 
You find 
Everyone lies 
First day with the jar 
You find 
Everyone lies, nobody minds, Everyone lies 
Where is the man you respect ? 
And where is the woman you love ? 
Where's the woman you love ? 
Third week with the jar
You find 
Everything dies 
We won't vote Conservative 
Because we never have 
Everyone lies, everyone lies 
Where is the man you respect ? 
And where is the woman you love ? 
Where's the woman you love ? 
Everything of worth 
On Earth, Is there, To share 
I used to dream, and I used to vow 
I wouldn't dream of it now 
We look to Los Angeles 
For the language we use 
London is dead, London is dead, London is dead, ...
Now I'm too much in love 
I'm too much in love, 
I know I'll go 
Empty hand 
From the land

 

WE HATE IT WHEN OUR FRIENDS BECOME SUCCESSFUL

We hate it when our friends become successful 
We hate it when our friends become successful 
Oh, look at those clothes 
Now look at that face, it's so old 
And such a video ! 
Well, it's really laughable 
Ha, ha, ha ...
We hate it when our friends become successful 
And if they're Northern, that makes it even worse
And if we can destroy them 
You bet your life we will 
Destroy them 
If we can hurt them 
Well, we may as well ... 
It's really laughable 
Ha, ha, ha ... 
You see, it should've been me 
It could've been me 
Everybody knows 
Everybody says so 
They say : 
"Ah, you have loads of songs 
So many songs 
More songs than they'd stand 
Verse 
Chorus 
Middle eight 
Break, fade 
Just listen ..."
La, la-la, la-la

 

NOW MY HEART IS FULL

There's gonna be some trouble 
A whole house will need re-building 
And everyone I love in the house 
Will recline on an analyst's couch quite 
Soon 
Your Father cracks a joke 
And in the usual way 
Empties the room 
Tell all of my friends 
(I don't have too many 
Just some rain-coated lovers' puny brothers)
Dallow, Spicer, Pinkie, Cubitt 
Rush to danger 
Wind up nowhere 
Patric Doonan - raised to wait 
I'm tired again, I've tried again, and 
Now my heart is full 
Now my heart is full 
And I just can't explain 
So I won't even try to
Dallow, Spicer, Pinkie, Cubitt 
Every jammy Stressford poet 
Loafing oafs in all-night chemists 
Loafing oafs in all-night chemists 
Underact - express depression 
Ah, but Bunnie I loved you 
I was tired again 
I've tried again, and 
Now my heart is full 
Now my heart is full 
And I just can't explain 
So I won't even try to 
Could you pass by ? 
Could you pass by ? 
Oh ... 
Now my heart is full 
Now my heart is full 
And I just can't explain 
So ... slow ... 
Slow ... slow ... slow ... slow ... slow ...

 

SPRING-HEELED JIM

Spring-heeled Jim winks an eye 
He'll "do", he'll never be "done to" 
He takes on whoever flew through 
"Well, it's the normal thing to do" ... ah ... 
Spring-heeled Jim lives to love 
Now kissing with his mouth full 
And his eyes on some other fool 
So many women 
His head should be spinning 
Ah, but no ! 
Ah, but no ! 
But no !
Ah, no !
Spring-heeled Jim slurs the words : 
"There's no need to be so knowing
Take life at five times the 
Average speed, like I do" 
Until Jim feels the chill 
"Oh, where did all the time go ?" 
Once always in for the kill 
Now it's too cold 
And he feels too 
old 
Too old
Mmm, old... 
La, la, la, la-la, la ...

 

BILLY BUDD

Say, Billy Budd 
So you think you should ? 
Oh, everyone's laughing 
Say, Billy Budd 
So you think that you should ? 
Everyone's laughing ! 
Since I took up with you 
Things have been bad 
Yeah, but now it's 12 years on 
Now it's 12 years on 
Yes, and I took up with you 
I took my job application 
Into town 
Did you hear ? They turned me down 
Yes, and it's all because of us 
Oh, and what was in our eyes 
Oh, what was in our eyes, yeah 
I said, Billy Budd 
I would happily lose 
Both of my legs 
I would lose both of my legs 
Oh, if it meant you could be free 
Oh, if it meant you could be free 
(Don't leave us in the dark!)

 

HOLD ON TO YOUR FRIENDS

A bond of trust 
Has been abused 
Something of value 
May be lost 
Give up your job 
Squander your cash - be rash 
Just hold on to your friends 
There are more than enough 
To fight and oppose 
Why waste good time 
Fighting the people you like 
Who will fall defending your name 
Oh, don't feel so ashamed 
To have friends 
But now you only call me 
When you're feeling depressed 
When you feel happy I'm 
So far from your mind 
My patience is stretched 
My loyalty vexed 
Oh, you're losing all of your friends 
Hold on to your friends 
Hold on to your friends 
Resist - or move on 
Be mad, be rash 
Smoke and explode 
Sell all of your clothes 
Just bear in mind : 
Oh, there just might come a time 
When you need some friends

 

THE MORE YOU IGNORE ME, THE CLOSER I GET

The more you ignore me 
The closer I get 
You're wasting your time 
The more you ignore me 
The closer I get 
You're wasting your time 
I will be 
In the bar 
With my head 
On the bar 
I am now 
A central part 
Of your mind's landscape 
Whether you care 
Or do not 
Yeah, I've made up your mind 
The more you ignore me 
The closer I get 
You're wasting your time 
The more you ignore me 
The closer I get 
You're wasting your time 
Beware !
I bear more grudges 
Than lonely high court judges 
When you sleep 
I will creep 
Into your thoughts 
Like a bad debt 
That you can't pay 
Take the easy way 
And give in 
Yeah, and let me in 
Oh, let me in 
Oh let me ... 
Oh, let me in 
IT'S WAR 
IT'S WAR 
WAR 
WAR 
Oh, let me in 
Ah, the closer I get 
Ah, you're asking for it 
Ah, the closer I get 
Ooh, the closer I ...

 

WHY DON'T YOU FIND OUT FOR YOURSELF

The sanest days are mad 
Why don't you find out for yourself ? 
Then you'll see the price 
Very closely 
Some men here 
They have a special interest 
In your career 
They wanna help you to grow 
And then syphon all your dough 
Why don't you find out for yourself ? 
Then you'll see the glass 
Hidden in the grass 
You'll never believe me, so 
Why don't you find out for yourself ? 
Sick down to my heart 
That's just the way it goes 
Some men here 
They know the full extent of 
Your distress 
They kneel and pray 
And they say : 
"Long may it last" 
Why don't you find out for yourself ?
Then you'll see the glass 
Hidden in the grass 
Bad scenes come and go 
For which you must allow 
Sick down to my heart 
That's just the way it goes 
Don't rake up my mistakes 
I know exactly what they are 
And ... what do YOU do ? 
Well ... you just SIT THERE 
I've been stabbed in the back 
So many many times 
I don't have any skin 
But that's just the way it goes

 

I AM HATED FOR LOVING

I am hated for loving 
I am hated for loving 
Anonymous call, a poison pen 
A brick in the small of the back again 
I still don't belong 
To anyone - I am mine 
And I am hated for loving 
I am haunted for wanting 
Anonymous call, a poison pen 
A brick in the ... ah ... 
A brick in the small of the back again 
I still don't belong 
To anyone - I am mine 
I am falling 
With no-one to catch me 
I am falling 
And there's still 
No-one to catch me 
Ah .. 
Anonymous call, a poison pen 
A brick in the ... ah ... 
A brick in the small of the back again 
I just don't belong 
To anywhere 
I just don't belong 
Mmm ... 
Ah ...

 

LIFEGUARD SLEEPING, GIRL DROWNING

Always looking for attention 
Always needs to be mentioned 
Who does she 
Think she should be ? 
The shrill cry through darkening air 
Doesn't she know he's 
Had such a busy day ? 
Tell her ... sshhh
Somebody tell her ... sshhh 
Slowest ... 
It was only a test 
But she swam too far 
Against the tide 
She deserves all she gets 
The sky became marked with stars 
As an out-stretched arm slowly 
Disappears 
Hooray 
Oh hooray 
No, oh, oh, woh, there's no movement 
No, oh, hooray 
Oh, hooray 
Please don't worry 
There'll be no fuss 
She was ... nobody's nothing 
(What's your name ?) 
When he awoke 
The sea was calm 
And another day passes like a dream 
There's no ... no way 
(What's your name ?)

 

USED TO BE A SWEET BOY

Used to be a sweet boy 
Holding so tightly 
To Daddy's hand 
But that was all 
In some distant land 
Blazer and tie 
And a big bright healthy smile 
Used to make all 
Of our trials worthwhile 
Used to be a sweet boy 
And I'm not to blame 
Something went wrong 
And I know 
I'm not to blame 
Something went wrong 
Can't be to blame 
Ah ...

 

THE LAZY SUNBATHERS

A world war 
Was announced 
Days ago 
But they didn't know 
The lazy sunbathers 
The lazy sunbathers 
The sun burns through 
To the planet's core 
And it isn't enough 
They want more 
Nothing 
Appears 
To be 
Between the ears of 
The lazy sunbathers 
Too jaded 
To question stagnation 
The sun burns through 
To the planet's core 
And it isn't enough 
They want more 
Religions fall 
Children shelled 
"...Children shelled ? That's all 
Very well, but would you 
Please keep the noise 
Down low ? 
Because you're waking 
The lazy sunbathers ..."
Oh, the lazy sunbathers 
The lazy sunbathers

 

SPEEDWAY

And when you slam 
Down the hammer 
Can you see it in your heart ? 
All of the rumours 
Keeping me grounded 
I never said, I never said that they were 
Completely unfounded 
So when you slam 
Down the hammer 
Can you see it in your heart ? 
Can you delve so low ? 
And when you're standing 
On my fingers 
Can you see it in your heart ? ... ah ... 
And when you try 
To break my spirit 
It won't work 
Because there's nothing left to break 
Anymore 
All of the rumours 
Keeping me grounded 
I never said, I never said that they were 
Completely unfounded 
You won't sleep 
Until the earth that wants me 
Finally has me 
Oh you've done it now 
You won't rest 
Until the hearse that becomes me 
Finally takes me 
Oh you've done it now 
And you won't smile 
Until my loving mouth 
Is shut good and proper 
FOREVER 
All of the rumours 
Keeping me grounded 
I never said, I never said that they were 
Completely unfounded 
And all those lies 
Written lies, twisted lies 
Well, they weren't lies 
They weren't lies 
They weren't lies 
I never said 
I never said 
I could have mentioned your name 
I could have dragged you in 
Guilt by implication 
By association 
I've always been true to you 
In my own strange way 
I've always been true to you 
In my own sick way 
I'll always stay true to you

 

THE TEACHERS ARE AFRAID OF THE PUPILS

There's too many people 
Planning your downfall 
When your spirit's on trial 
These nights can be frightening 
Sleep transports sadness 
To some other mid-brain 
And somebody here 
Will not be here next year 
So you stand by the board 
Full of fear and intention 
And, if you think that they're listening 
Well, you've got to be joking 
Oh, you understand change 
And you think it's essential 
But when your profession 
Is humiliation 
Say the wrong word to our children ...
We'll have you, oh yes, we'll have you 
Lay a hand on our children 
And it's never too late to have you 
Mucus on your collar 
A nail up through the staff chair 
A blade in your soap 
And you cry into your pillow 
To be finished would be a relief 
To be finished would be a relief... 
Say the wrong word to our children ...
We'll have you, oh yes, we'll have you 
Lay a hand on our children 
And it's never too late to have you 
To be finished would be a relief 
To be finished would be a relief...
I'm very glad this thing has come 
Sometimes I'm so glad 
Never bother to play the tunes 
I've seen it coming for dear life

 

READER MEET AUTHOR

You don't know a thing about their lives 
They live where you wouldn't dare to drive
You shake as you think of how they sleep 
But you write as if you are my side-by-side 
Reader, meet Author 
With the hope of hearing sense 
But you may be feeling let down 
By the words of defence 
He says : "No-one ever sees me when I cry"
You don't know a thing about their lives 
Books don't save them, books aren't Stanley knives 
And if a fight broke out here tonight 
You'd be the first away, because you're that type 
And the Year 2000 won't change anyone here 
As each fabled promise flies so fast 
You'll swear it was never there 
Oh, have you ever escaped from a shipwrecked life ? 
So safely with your software; all miles from the front line 
You hear the way their sad voices, and you start to imagine things 
Oh, any excuse to write more lies

We're gonna kill this pretty thing...

 

THE OPERATION

You fight with your right hand 
And caress with your left hand 
Everyone I know is sick to death of you 
With a tear that's a mile wide 
In the kite that you're flying 
Everyone I know is sick to death of you 
Ever since 
You don't look the same 
You're just not the same, no way 
You say clever things and 
You never used to 
You don't catch what I'm saying 
When you're deafened to advice 
Everyone here is sick to the 
Back teeth of you 
With a tear that's a mile wide 
In the kite that you're flying 
Everyone here is sick to the 
Tattoo of you 
Ever since 
You don't look the same 
You're just not the same, no way 
You say pleasant things and 
There is no need to
Still, you fight with your right hand 
And caress with your left hand 
Ooh, ooh ... Sad to say ... 
How once I was in love with you 
Sad to say ... 
You don't catch what I'm saying 
When you're deafened to advice 
Ooh, ooh ... Ever since 
You don't look the same 
You're just not the same, no way 
What the hell have 
They stuck into you ?

 

DAGENHAM DAVE

Head in the clouds, and a mouthful of pie 
Head in a blouse, everybody loves him 
I see why 
Dagenham Dave, Dagenham Dave, Oh, Dagenham Dave 
Dagenham Dave, Dagenham Dave, Oh, Dagenham Dave 
"I love Karen, I love Sharon" on the windowscreen 
With never the need to fight or to question a single thing 
Dagenham Dave, Dagenham Dave Oh, Dagenham Dave 
Dagenham Dave, Dagenham Dave Oh, Dagenham Dave ...
He'd love to touch, he's afraid that he might self-combust 
I could say more, but you get the general idea 
Dagenham Dave, Dagenham Dave Dagenham Dave, Dagenham Dave 
Dagenham, Dagenham Dagenham Dave, Dagenham Dave ...
Oh, Dave, oh, Dagenham, dagenham, Oh, Dave, oh, Dave, ...

 

DO YOUR BEST AND DON'T WORRY

Compare the best of their days 
With the worst of your days 
You won't win 
With your standards so high 
And your spirits so low 
At least remember ... 
This is you on a bad day, you on a pale day 
Just do your best and don't ... Don't worry, oh 
The way you hang yourself is oh, so unfair 
See the best of how they look 
Against the worst of how you are
And again, you won't win 
With your standards so high 
And your spirits so low 
At least remember ... 
This is you on a drab day, you in a drab dress 
Just do your best and don't ... Don't worry, oh 
The way you hang yourself is oh, so unfair 
Just do your best and don't ... Don't worry, oh 
The way you watch yourself is oh, so unfair 
Just do your best and don't ... Don't worry, oh 
Do your best and don't ...

SOUTHPAW

You were a boy before you became a man 
I don't see the joy 
And you ran with your pals in the sun 
You turned around and they were gone 
Again ... 
A sick boy should be treated 
So easily defeated 
Oh, I just don't understand 
So you ran with your pals in the sun 
You turned around 
You were alone 
Again ... 
And you ran back to Ma 
Which set the pace for the rest of your days 
Oh, you ran back to Ma 
Which set the pace for the rest of your days 
Oh, you ran back to Ma 
Which set the pace for the rest of your days 
And now, there is something that you should know 
There is something that you should know 
The girl of your dreams is 
Here all alone 
Girl of your dreams is 
Here all alone 
The girl of your dreams is 
Sad and all alone 
The girl of your dreams is 
Here all alone 
There is something that you should know 
There is something that you should know 
Girl of your dreams is 
Here all alone 
The girl of your dreams is 
Sad and is all alone 
The girl of your dreams is 
Sad and is feeling all alone 
Oh, there is something that you should know 
Help me, help me, help me ...

 

MALADJUSTED

I wanna start from 
Before the beginning 
Loot wine, "Be mine, and 
Then let's stay out for the night"
Ride via Parkside 
Semi-perilous lives 
Jeer the lights in the windows 
Of all safe and stable homes 
(But wondering then, well what 
Could peace of mind be like ?)
Anyway do you want to hear 
Our story, or not ? 
As the Fulham Road lights 
Stretch and invite into the night 
From a Stevenage overspill 
We'd kill to live around 
SW6 - with someone like you 
Keep thieves' hours 
With someone like you 
...As long as it slides 
You stalk the house 
In a low-cut blouse : 
"Oh Christ, another stifled 
Friday night !"
And the Fulham Road lights 
Stretch and invite into the night 
Well, I was fifteen 
What could I know ?
When the gulf between 
All the things I need 
And the things I receive 
Is an ancient ocean 
Wide, wild, lost, uncrossed 
Still I maintain there's nothing 
Wrong with you 
You do all that you do 
Because it's all you can do 
Well, I was fifteen 
Where could I go ?
With a soul full of loathing 
For stinging bureaucracy 
Making it anything 
Other than easy 
For working girls like me 
With my hands on my head 
I flop on your bed 
With a head full of dread 
For all I've ever said 
Maladjusted, maladjusted 
Maladjusted maladjusted 
Never to be trusted 
Oh, never to be trusted 
There's nothing wrong with you, oh 
...There's nothing wrong with you

 

ALMA MATTERS

So : the choice I have made 
May seem strange to you 
But who asked you, anyway ? 
It's my life to wreck 
My own way 
You see : to someone, somewhere, oh yeah ... 
Alma matters 
In mind, body and soul 
In part, and in whole 
Because to someone, somewhere, oh yeah ... 
Alma matters 
In mind, body and soul 
In part, and in whole 
So the life I have made 
May seem wrong to you 
But, I've never been surer 
It's my life to ruin 
My own way 
You see : to someone, somewhere, oh yeah ... 
Alma matters 
In mind, body and soul 
In part, and in whole 
Because to someone, somewhere, oh yeah ... 
Alma matters 
In mind, body and soul 
In part, and in whole 
To someone, somewhere, oh yeah ... 
Alma matters 
In mind, body and soul 
Part, and in whole 
So to someone, somewhere, oh yeah ... 
Alma matters 
In mind, body and soul 
Part, and in whole 
To someone, somewhere, oh yeah ... 
Oh yeah ... Oh yeah, oh yeah Oh yeah ...

 

AMBITIOUS OUTSIDERS

Bolt-lock your doors 
Alarm your cars 
And still we move in closer 
Every day 
Top of the list 
Is your smiling kids 
But we'll be smiling too 
So that's OK 
Oh, and by the way 
Thank you, because you're 
Giving, giving, giving 
And we're receiving - 
No, no, we're taking 
Keeping the population down 
Your taxes paid, but 
Police waylaid 
And we knows 
When the school bus 
Comes and goes 
We're on your street, but 
You don't see us 
Or, if you do 
You smile and say Hello 
BUT DON'T UNDERESTIMATE US 
When you are 
Giving, giving, giving 
And we're receiving - 
No, no, we're taking 
Just keeping 
The population down 
You're giving, giving, giving 
Well, it's your own fault 
For reproducing 
We're just keeping 
The population down

 

TROUBLE LOVES ME

Trouble loves me 
Trouble needs me 
Two things 
More than you do 
Or would attempt to 
So, console me 
Otherwise, hold me 
Just when it seems like 
Everything's evened out 
And the balance 
Seems serene 
Trouble loves me 
Walks beside me 
To chide me 
Not to guide me 
It's still much more 
Than you'll do 
So, console me 
Otherwise, hold me 
Just when it seems like 
Everything's evened out 
And the balance seems serene 
See the fool I'll be 
Still running 'round 
On the flesh rampage 
Still running 'round 
Ready with ready-wit 
Still running 'round 
On the flesh rampage 
- At your age ! 
Go to Soho, oh 
Go to waste in 
The wrong arms 
Still running 'round 
Trouble loves me 
Seeks and finds me 
To charlatanize me 
Which is only 
As it should be 
Oh, please fulfill me 
Otherwise, kill me 
Show me a barrel and watch me scrape it 
Faced with the music, as always I'll face it 
In the half-light 
So English, frowning 
Then at midnight I 
Can't get you out of my head 
A disenchanted taste 
Still running 'round 
A disenchanted taste 
Still running 'round

 

PAPA JACK

Papa Jack 
Wants to turn 
Back the clock 
And reach out 
To the kids 
He once had 
Who have flown 
Papa Jack 
In decline 
Feels inclined 
To reach out 
To the kids 
He once had 
Who have flown 
But there was a time 
When the kids reached up 
And Papa Jack just 
Pushed them away 
Looking deep 
In his heart 
Papa Jack 
Doesn't like 
What he sees 
Or the time 
On his hands 
The dying day 
The chilly sun 
Papa Jack 
All alone 
Sings slow 
Grieving and low 
But there was a time 
When the kids reached up 
Now you can't always 
Have it your way 
Papa Jack 
Ah ...

 

AMMUNITION

I know these roads 
Each ridge 
And narrow bridge 
Each cheveron 
Enticing me on 
Each warning sign 
I take in my stride 
I don't need more ammunition 
I've got more than I can spend 
I don't dwell on things I'm missing 
I'm just pleased 
With the things I've found 
I know these roads 
An old hand understands 
Above all, I know what's 
Expected of me now 
Veering cliffwards 
I don't need more ammunition 
I've got more than I can spend 
I don't dwell on things I'm missing 
I'm just pleased 
With the things I've found 
With the things I've found 
With the things I've found 
I've found 
I've been crying 
It comes back on these salient days 
And it stays 
And it says : 
"We've never really been away" 
I don't need more ammunition 
I've got more than I can spend 
I don't think of who I'm missing 
I've got no space and no time 
In my life, anymore 
No space or time 
In my life, anymore 
For Revenge

 

WIDE TO RECEIVE

Download something 
Useful, or useless 
Because I'm lying here 
Wide to receive 
Almost anything 
You'd care to give 
And I don't 
Get along with myself 
And I'm not too keen 
On anyone else 
Turn on, plug in 
Then just walk away 
Unlock, process 
And then just go 
And I've never felt quite so alone 
As I do right now 
I'm lying here 
Wide to receive 
Almost anything 
You'd care to leave 
Wide, wide, wide Wide, wide, wide...

 

ROY'S KEEN

(GO ON !)
He's romancing you 
And chancing his arm 
He'll be here 
Smiling on time 
He's romancing you 
And chancing his arm 
He'll be here 
Smiling on time 
Roy's keen oh Roy's keen 
Roy's keen oh Roy's keen 
We've never seen a 
Keener window-cleaner 
Back up the ladder 
Into each corner 
Dunking the chamois 
Just think of the goodwill 
The ladder's a planet 
Roy is a star, and 
I am a satellite 
(But that's alright) 
He can hold a smile for as long 
As you require (even longer) 
He can hold a smile for as long 
As you require (even longer) 
Roy's keen oh Roy's keen 
Roy's keen oh Roy's keen 
We've never seen a 
Keener window-cleaner 
Back up the ladder 
Into each corner 
Dunking the chamois 
Just think of the goodwill 
The ladder's a planet 
Roy is a star, and 
I am a satellite 
I will be set alight 
Don't say you'll hold it steady 
Then you let it go 
Don't say you'll hold it steady 
Then you let it go Oh ...
You're up the ladder 
Into each corner 
Foot in a bucket 
We trust you to wreck it 
Even when it's under your nose 
Well, you just can't 
See it, can you ? 
Well, it's here 
Right under your nose 
And you just can't 
See it, can you? La la la la ...
Roy's keen, Roy's keen La la la la ...
We've never seen a 
Keener window-cleaner 
Oh ... La la la la ...

 

HE CRIED

I need you 
Simple words 
But words which had never been heard 
By the soul 
Stoned to death 
But still living 
And so he froze where he stood 
And he looked to the ground 
And he cried 
He cried 
Ride our minds 
If you must 
But there's always a line you don't cross 
Time is short 
Don't be cruel 
Oh you don't know the power 
In what you're saying 
Oh ... 
And so he froze where he stood 
And he looked to the ground 
And he cried 
He cried 
People where 
I come from 
They survive without feelings or blood 
I never could 
Was stoned to death 
But I'm still living 
So he froze where he stood 
And he looked to the ground 
And he cried 
He cried 
So he froze 
And he looked, and he looked 
To the ground 
And he cried 
He cried

 

SORROW WILL COME IN THE END

Legalized theft 
Leaves me bereft 
I get it straight in the neck 
(Somehow expecting no less) 
A court of justice 
With no use for Truth 
Lawyer ...liar 
Lawyer ...liar 
You pleaded and squealed 
And you think you've won 
But Sorrow will come 
To you in the end 
And as sure as my words are pure 
I praise the day that brings you pain 
Q.C.'s obsessed with sleaze 
Frantic for Fame 
They're all on the game 
They just use a different name 
You lied 
And you were believed 
By a J.P. senile and vile 
You pleaded and squealed 
And you think you've won 
But Sorrow will come 
To you in the end 
And as sure as my words are pure 
I praise the day that brings you pain 
So don't close your eyes 
Don't close your eyes 
A man who slits throats 
Has time on his hands 
And I'm gonna get you 
So don't close your eyes 
Don't ever close your eyes 
You think you've won 
OH NO

 

SATAN REJECTED MY SOUL

Satan rejected my soul 
He knows my kind 
He won't be dragged down 
He's seen my face around 
He knows Heaven doesn't seem 
To be my home 
So I must find 
Somewhere else to go 
So I must find 
Somewhere else to go 
So, take it - please 
It's free 
You'll never see 
You'll never see 
All the fun in life it's cost me 
Satan rejected my soul 
As low as he goes 
He never quite goes this low 
He's seen my face around 
He knows Heaven doesn't seem 
To be my home 
So I must find 
Somewhere else to go 
So I must find 
Somewhere else to go 
So, take it please 
It's really sly 
Come on, come on, ah Come on, come on, come on 
Take it please, It's really sly 
Come on, come on, ah Come on, come on, come on 
Call me in, Pull me in, call me in 
Come on, come on, oh Come on, come on, come on 
Pull me in, pull me in, Call me in, haul me in, pull me in 
Come on, come on, ah, Come on, come on 
La la la la la, Oh ...

 
 REEL AROUND THE FOUNTAIN

It's time the tale was told
of how you took a child
and you made him old
Reel around the fountain
slap me on the patio
I'll take it now
Fifteen minutes with you
well, I wouldn't say no
people said that you were virtually dead
and they were so wrong
fifteen minutes with you
well, i wouldn't say no
people said that you were easily led
and they were half-right
I dreamt about you last night
and i fell out of bed twice
you can pin and mount me like a butterfly
but take me to the haven of your bed
was something that you never said
two lumps, please
you're the bee's knees
but so am I
Meet me at the fountain
shove me on the patio
I'll take it slowly
Fifteen minutes with you
oh I wouldn't say no
people see no worth in you
oh but I do

 

YOU'VE GOT EVERYTHING NOW

As merry as the days were long
I was right and you were wrong
back at the old grey school
I would win and you would lose
But you've got everything now
and what a terrible mess I've made of my life
No, I've never had a job
because I've never wanted one
I've seen you smile
but I've never really heard you laugh
So who is rich and who is poor?
I cannot say...
You are your mother's only son
and you're a desperate one
But I don't want a lover
I just want to be seen in the back of your car
A friendship sadly lost?
Well, this is true ...and yet, it's false
Did I ever tell you , by the way
I never did like your face
But you've got everything now
and what a terrible mess I've made of my life
No, I've never had a job
because I'm too shy
But I don't want a lover
I just want to be tied to the back of your car.

 

MISERABLE LIE

So, goodbye
please stay with your own kind
and I'll stay with mine
There's something against us
it's not time
So, goodbye
I know I hardly say
how much I love your casual way
but please put your tongue away
a little higher and we're well away
the dark nights are drawing in
and your humour is as black as them
I look at yours, you laugh at mine
and"love" is just a miserable lie
you have destroyed my flower like-life
not once-but twice
you have corrupt my innocent mind
not once-but twice
I know that wind-swept mystical air
it means: I'd like to see your underwear
I recognise that mystical air
it means: I'd like to see your underwear
what do we get for the trouble and pain?
just a rented room in Whalley Range
into the depths of the criminal world
I followed her...
I need advice, I need advice
because nobody ever looks at me twice
I'm just a country-mile behind
the world
I'm just a country mile behind
the whole world
so take me when you go

 

PRETTY GIRLS MAKE GRAVES

Upon the sand,upon the bay
"there is a quick and easy way" you say
before you illustrate
I'd rather state:
"I'm not the man you think I am
I'm not the man you think I am "
And Sorrow's native son
he will not smile for anyone
And pretty girls makes the graves
End of the pier, end of the bay
you tug my arm and say:"Give into lust,
give up to lust, oh heaven knows we'll
soon be dust..."
But I'm not the man you think I am
I'm not the man you think I am
And Sorrow's native son
he will not rise for anyone
And pretty girls make graves
I could have been wild and I could have been free
but Nature played this trick on me
She wants it Now
and she will not wait
but she's too rough
and I'm too delicate
Then on the sand
another man, he takes her hand
and a smile lights up her stupid face
(and well, it would)
I lost my faith in Womanhood
I lost my faith in Womanhood, I lost my faith

 

THE HAND THAT ROCKS THE CRADLE

Please don't cry
the ghost and the storm outside
will not invade this sacred shire
nor infiltrate your mind
my life down I shall lie
if the bogey-man should try
to play tricks on your sacred mind
to tease, torment and tantalise
wavering shadows loom
a piano plays in an empty room
there'll be blood on the cleaver tonight
when darkness lifts and the room is bright
I'll still be by your side
for you are all that matters
and I'll love you till the day I die
there never need to be longing in your eyes
as long as the hand that rocks the cradle is mine
ceiling shadows shimmy by
and when the wardrobe towers like a beast of prey
there's a sadness in your beautiful eyes
you're untouched, unsoiled, wonderous eyes
my life down I shall lie
should restless spirts try
to play tricks on you sacred mind
but whom I never gave a name
I just looked into his wonderous eyes
and said" never never never again"
all too soon I did return
just like a moth to a flame
so rattle my bones all over the stones
because I'm only a beggar-man whom nobody owns
see how words as old as sin
fit me like a glove I'm here and here I'll stay
together we lie, together we pray
there never need be longing in your eyes
as long as the hand that rocks the cradle is mine

 

STILL ILL

I decree today that life
is simply taking and not giving
England is mine and it owes me a living
ask me why, and I'll spit in your eye
ask me why, and I'll spit in your eye
but we cannot cling to the old dreams anymore
no, we cannot cling to the old dreams anymore
Does the body rule the mind
or does the mind rule the body?
I dunno...
Under the iron bridge we kissed
and although I ended up with sore lips
it just wasn't like the old days anymore
no, it wasn't like those days
am I still ill?
Does the body rule the mind
or does the mind rule the body ?
I dunno...
Ask me why, and I'll die
ask me why, and I'll die
and if you must go to work tomorrow
well, if I were you I wouldn't bother
for there are brighter sides to life
and I should know because I've seen them
but not very often...
under the iron bridge we kissed
and although I ended up with sore lips
it just wasn't like the old days anymore
no, it wasn't like those days
am I still ill?

 

HAND IN GLOVE

Hand in glove
the sun shines out of our behinds
no, it's not like any other love
this one is different-because it's us
Hand in glove
we can go wherever we please
and everything depends upon
how near you stand to me
And if the people stare
then the people stare
I really don't know and I really don't care
Hand in glove
the Good People laugh
yes, we may be hidden by rags
but we have something they'll never have
So, hand in glove I stake my claim
I'll fight to the last breath
If they dare touch a hair on your head
I'll fight to the last breath
The Good Life is out there, somewhere
so stay on my arm, you little charmer
But I know my luck too well
and I'll probably never see you again.

 

WHAT DIFFERENCE DOES IT MAKE?

All men have secrets and here is mine
so let it be known
we have been through hell and high tide,
I can surely rely on you?
and yet you start to recoil,
heavy words are so lightly thrown
but still I'd leap in front of a flying bullet for you
So, what difference does it make?
so, what difference does it make?
it makes none
but you have gone
and you must be looking very old tonight
The devil will find work for idle hands to do
I stole and I lied, and why?
because you asked me to!
but now you make feel so ashamed
because I've only got two hands
well, I'm still fond of you
So, what difference does it make?
so, what difference does it make?
it makes none
but you have gone
and your prejudice won't keep you warm tonight
So, no more apologies
no more apologies
I'm too tired
I'm too sick and tired
and I'm feeling very sick and ill today
But I'm still fond of you

 

I DON'T OWE YOU ANYTHING

Bought on stolen wine
a nod was the first step
you know very well
what was coming next
did I really walk all this way
just to hear you say
"oh I don't want to go out tonight"
but you will
for you must
I don't owe you anything
but you owe me something
repay me now
you should never go to them
let them come to you
just like I do
you should not go to them
let them come to you
just like I do
Too freely on your lips
words prematurely said
oh but I know what will make you smile tonight
Life is never kind
life is never kind
oh but I know what will make you smile tonight

 

SUFFER LITTLE CHILDREN

Over the moors,take me to the moors
dig a shallow grave
and I'll lay me down
Lesley-Anne, with your pretty white beads
oh John, you'll never be a man
and you'll never see your home again
oh Manchester, so much to answer for
Edward, see those alluring lights?
tonight will be your very last night
a woman said "I know my son is dead
I'll never rest my hands on his scared head"
Hindley wakes and Hindley says:
"Wherever he has gone, I have gone "
But fresh lilaced moorland fields
cannot hide the stoild stench of death
Hindley wakes and Hindley says:
"Whatever he has done, I have done"
But this is no easy ride
for a child cries
"find me...find me, nothing more
we're on a sullen misty moor
we may be dead and we may be gone
but we will be right by your side
until the day you die
this is no easy ride
we will haunt you when you laugh
yes, you could say we're a team
you might sleep
BUT YOU WILL NEVER DREAM!"
Oh Manchester, so much to answer for
Oh Manchester, so much to answer for
Over the moor, I'm on the moor
the child is on the moor

 

THE HEADMASTER RITUAL

Belligerent ghouls
run Manchester schools
spineless swines
cemented mines
Sir leads the troops
jealous of youth
same old suit since 1962
he does the military two-step
down the nape of my neck
I wanna go home
I don't want to stay
give up education
is a bad mistake
mid-week on the playing fields
Sir thwacks you on the knees
knees you in the groin
elbow in the face
I wanna go home
I don't want to stay
Belligerent ghouls
run Manchester schools
spineless bastards all
Sir leads the troops
jealous of youth
same old jokes since 1902
he does the military two-step
down the nape of my neck
I wanna go home
I don't want to stay
give up life
as a bad mistake
please excuse me from gym
I've got this terrible cold coming on
he grabs and devours
he kicks me in the showers
kicks me in the showers
and he grabs and devours
I wanna go home
I don't want to stay

 

RUSHOLME RUFFIANS

The last night at the fair
by the big wheel generator
a boy is stabbed
and his money is grabbed
and the air hangs heavy like a dulling wine
she is famous
she is funny
an engagement ring
doesn't mean a thing
to a mind consumed by brass(money)
and though I walk home alone
my faith in love is still devout
the last night at the fair
from a seat on a whirling waltzer
her skirt ascends for a watching eye
it's a hideous trait( on her mother's side)
and though I walk home alone
my faith in love is still devout
then someone falls in love
and someone's beaten up
and the senses being dulled are mine
and someone falls in love
someone's beaten up
and the senses being dulled are mine
and though I walk home alone
my faith in love is still devout
this is the last night of the fair
and the grease in the hair
of a speedway operator
is all a tremulous heart requires
a schoolgirl is denied
she said "How quickly would I die
if I jumped from the top of the parachutes?"

scratch my name on your arm with a fountain pen

I WANT THE ONE I CAN'T HAVE

On the day that your mentality
catches up with your biology
I want the one I can't have
and it's driving me mad
it's written all over my face
A double-bed
and a stalwart lover, for sure
these are the riches of the poor
A double-bed
and a stalwart lover, for sure
these are the riches of the poor
a tough kid who sometimes swallows nails
raised on Prisoner's Aid
he killed a policeman when he was thirteen
and somehow that really impressed me
it's written all over my face
On the day that your mentality
catches up with your biology
And if you ever need self-validation
just meet me in the alley by the
railway-station
it's written all over my face

 

WHAT SHE SAID

What she said:
"How come someone hasn't noticed
that I'm dead
and decided to bury me
God knows, I'm ready"
What she said was
but then, all the rejection she's had
to pretend to be happy
could only be idiocy
What she said was not for the job or
lover that she never had
What she read
all heady books
she'd sit and prophesise
(it took a tattoed boy from Birkenhead
to really really open her eyes)

THAT JOKE ISN'T FUNNY ANYMORE

Park the car at the side of the road
you should know
time's tide will smother you
and I will too
when you laugh about other people who feel so
very lonely
their only desire is to die
well I'm afraid
it doesn't make me smile
I wish I could laugh
but that joke isn't funny anymore
it's too close to home and it's too near the bone
it's too close to home and it's too near the bone
more than you'll ever know
It was dark as I drove the point home
and on cold leather seats
well, it suddenly struck me
I just might die with a smile on my
face after all
I've seen this happen in other people's lives
and now it's happening in mine

 

NOWHERE FAST

I'd like to drop my trousers to the world
I am a man of means(of slender means)
each household appliance
is like a new science in my town
and if a day came when I felt a natural emotion
I'd get such a shock I'd probably jump in the ocean
and when a train goes by
it's such a sad sound
I'd like to drop my trousers to the Queen
every sensible child will know what this means
the poor and the needy
are selfish and greedy on her terms
and if the day came when I felt a natural emotion
I'd get such a shock I'd probably jump in the ocean
and when a train goes by
it's such a sad song
And when I'm lying in my bed
I think about life
and I think about death
and neither one particularly appeals to me
and if the day came when I felt a natural emotion
I'd get such a shock I'd probably lie
in the middle of the street and die
I'd lie down and die

 

WELL I WONDER

Well I wonder
do you hear me when you sleep?
I hoarsely cry
Well I wonder
do you see me when we pass?
I half-die
Please keep me in mind
please keep me in mind
Gasping-but somehow still alive
this is the fierce last stand of all I am
Gasping-dying-but somehow still alive
this is the final stand of all I am
Please keep me in mind

 

BARBARISM BEGINS AT HOME

Unruly boys
who will not grow up
must be taken in hand
Unruly girls
who will not settle down
they must be taken in hand
A crack on the head
is what you get for not asking
and a crack on the head
is what you get for asking

 

MEAT IS MURDER

Heifer whines could be human cries
closer comes the screaming knife
this beautiful creature must die
this beautiful creature must die
a death for no reason
and death for reason is MURDER
and the flesh you so fancifully fry
is not succulent, tasty or nice
it's death for no reason
and death for no reason is MURDER
and the calf that you carve with a smile
is MURDER
and the turkey you festively slice
is MURDER
do you know how animals die?
kitchen aroma aren't very homely
it's not "comforting," "cheery" or kind
it's sizzling blood and the unholy stench
of MURDER
it's not "natural," "normal" or kind
the fleas you so fancifully fry
as you savour the flavour
of MURDER
NO, NO, NO, IT'S MURDER
NO, NO, NO, IT'S MURDER
who hears when animals cry?

 

THE QUEEN IS DEAD

Farewell to this lands cheerless marches
hemmed in like a boar between arches
her very Lowness with her head in a sling
Im truely sorry-but it sounds like a wonderful thing
dear Charles, dont you ever crave
to appear on the front of the Daily mail
dressed in your Mother's bridal veil?
So, I checked all the registered historical facts
and I was shocked into shame to discover
how Im the 18th pale descendent
of some, old queen or other
has the world changed, or have I changed?
has the world changed, or have I changed?
as some 9-year old tough peddles drugs
(I never even knew what drugs were)
And so, I broke into the Palace
with a sponge and a rusty spanner
she said: "Eh, I know you, and you cannot sing"
I said: "that's nothing -you should hear me play piano"
We can go for a walk where it's quiet and dry
and we can talk about precious things
but when you are tied to your mother's apron
not one talks about castration
We can go for a walk where it's quiet and dry
and we can talk about precious things
like love and law and poverty
these are the things that kill me
We can go for a walk where it's quiet and dry
and we can talk about precious things
but the rain that flattens my hair
theses are the things that kill me
Passed the Pub that saps your body
and the church who'll snatch your money
the Queen is dead, boys
and it's so lonely on a limb
Pass the Pub that wrecks your body
and the church-all they want is your money
the Queen is dead, boys`
you can trust me, boys
life is very long, when you're lonely
life is very long, when you're lonely...

 

FRANKLY MR.SHANKLY

Frankly, Mr Shankly, this position Ive held
it pays my way, but it corrodes my soul
I want to leave you will not miss me
I want to go down in musical history
Frankly, Mr Shankly, Im a sickening wreck
Ive got the 21st Century breathing down my neck
I must move fast, you understand me
I want to go down in celluloid history
Fame, Fame, fatal Fame
it can play hideous tricks on the brain
but still I rather be Famous
than righteous or holy, any day
but sometimes Id feel more fulfilled
making Christmas cards with the mentally ill
I want to Live and I want to Love
I want to catch something that I might be ashamed of
Frankly, Mr Shankly, this position I've held
it pays my way and it corrodes my soul
oh, I didnt realise that you wrote poetry
(I didnt realise you wrote such bloody awful poetry)
Frankly, Mr Shankly, since you ask
you are a flatulent pain the arse
I do not mean to be so rude
but still, I must speck frankly, Mr Shankly

 

I KNOW IT'S ALL OVER

Oh Mother, I can fell the soil falling over my head
and as i climb into an empty bed
Oh well, Enough said
I know it's over-still I cling
I don't know where else I can go
Oh Mother, I can feel the soil falling over my head
see, the sea want s to take me
the knife wants to cut me
do you think you can help me?
Sad veiled bride, please be happy
handsome groom, give her room
loud, loutish lover, treat her kindly
(although she needs you
more than she loves you)
and I know it's over
and it never really began
but in my heart it was so real
and you even spoke to me and said:
"If you're so funny
then why are you on your own tonight?
and if you are so clever
then why are you on your own tonight?
if you're so terribly good looking
then why do you sleep alone tonight?
because tonight is just like any other night
that's why you're on your own tonight
with your triumphs and your charms
while they are in each other's arms.."
It's so easy to laugh
it's so easy to hate
it takes strength to be gentle and kind
It's so easy to laugh
it's so easy to hate
it takes guts to be gentle and kind
love is Natural and Real
but not for you, my love
not tonight my love
love is Natural and Real
but not for such as you and I, my love
Oh Mother, I can fell the soil falling over my head
Oh Mother, I can fell the soil falling over my head...

 

NEVER HAD NO ONE EVER

When you walk without ease
on these
the very streets where you were raised
I had a really bad dream
it lasted 20 years, 7 months, and 27 days
Never had no one ever.

 

CEMETERY GATES

A dreaded sunny day
so I meet you at the cemetry gates
Keats and Yeats are on your side
A dreaded sunny day
so I meet you at the cemetry gates
Keats and Yeats are on your side
while Wilde is on mine
So we go inside and we gravely read the stones
all those people all those lives
where are they now ?
with loves, and hates
and passions just like mine
they were born
and then they lived and then they died
which seems so unfair
and I wantr to crv
You say: "ere thrice the sun hath done salutation to the dawn"
and you claim these words as your own
but Im well-read, have heard them said
a hundred times (maybe less, maybe more)
if you must write prose/poems
the words you use should be your own
dont plagiarise or take "on loans"
there's alweays someone, somewhere
with a big nose, who knows
and who trips you up and laughs
when you fall
You say: "ere long done do does did "
words which could only be your own
you then produce the text
from whence was ripped
(some dizzy whore, 1804)
A dreaded sunny day
so let's go where we're happy
so I meet you at the cemetry gates
Keats and Yeats are on your side
A dreaded sunny day
so let's go where we're wanted
so I meet you at the cemetry gates
Keats and Yeats are on your side
but you lose
because Wilde is on mine

 

BIGMOUTH STRIKES AGAIN

Sweetness, sweetness I was only joking
when I said Id like to smash every tooth
in your head
Sweetness, sweetness I was only joking
when I said by right s you should be
bludgeoned in your bed
and now I know how Joan of Arc felt
now I know how Joan of Arc felt
as the flames roseto her roman nose
and her Walkman stared to melt
Bibmouth, bigmouth
bigmouth strikes again
and Ive got no right to take my place
with the Human race
and now I know how Joan of Arc felt
now I know of Joan of Arc felt
as the flames rose to her roman nose
and her hearing aid started to melt
Bigmouth, bigmouth
bigmouth strikes again
and Ive got no right to take my place
with the Human race

 

THE BOY WITH A THORN IN HIS SIDE

The boy with the thorn in his side
behind the hatred there lies
a murderous desire for love
how can they look into my eyes
and still they dont believe me
how can they hear me say those words
and still they dont believe me
and if they don't believe me now
will they ever believe me?
and if they don't believe me now
will they ever believe me?
The boy with the thorn in his side
behind the hatred there lies
a plundering desire for love
how can they see the Love in our eyes
and still they don't believe us
and after all this time
they don't want to believe us
and if they dont believe us now
will they ever believe us ?
andd when you want to Live
how do you start ?
where do you go ?
who do you know?

 

VICAR IN A TUTU

I was minding mind business
lifting some lead off
the roof of the Holy Name church
it was worthwhile living a laughable life
just to set my eyes on a blistering sight
of a vicar in a tu-tu
he's not strange
he just wants to live his life this way
a scanty bit of a thing
with a decorative ring
that wouldn't cover the head of a child
as Rose collects the money in the cannister
who comes sliding down the bannister
the vicar in a tu-tu
he's not strange
he just wants to live his life this way
the monkish monsignor
with a head full of plaster
said "my man, get your vile soul dry-cleaned"
as Rose counts the money in the cannister
as natural as rain
he dances again
vicar in a tu-tu
The next day in the pulpit
with Freedom and Ease
combating ignoranca,dust and disease
as Rose counts the money in the cannister
as natural as rain
he dances again
the fabric of a tu-tu
any man could get us to
and I am a living sign.

 

THERE IS A LIGHT THAT NEVER GOES OUT

Take me out tonight
where there's music and there's people
who are young and alive
driving in your car
I never never want to go home
because I havent got one
anymore
take me out tonight
because I want to see people and I
want to see lights
driving in your car
oh please dont drop me home
because it's not my home, it's their
home, and Im welcome no morw
and if a double-decker bus
crashes in to us
to die by your side
such a heavenly way to die
and if a ten ton truck
kills the both of us
to die by your side
the pleasure and the privilege is mine
take me out tonight
oh take me anywhere, I dont care
and in the darken underpass
I thought Oh God, my chance has come at last
(but then a strange fear gripped me and I just couldn't ask)
take me out tonight
take me anywhere, I dont care
just driving in your car
I never never want to go home
because I havent got one
I havent got one.

 

SOME GIRLS ARE BIGGER THAN OTHERS

From the ice-age to the dole-age
there is but one concern
and I have just discover
some girls are bigger than others
some girls are bigger than others
some girls mothers are bigger than
other girls mothers
As Anthony said to Cleopatra
as he opened a crate of ale:
some girls are bigger than others
some girls are bigger than others
some girls mothers are bigger than
other girls mothers.

 

A RUSH AND A PUSH AND AND THE LAND IS OURS

HELLO
I am the ghost of Troubled Joe
hung by his pretty white neck
some eighteen months ago
I travelled to a mystical time zone
but I missed my bed
so I soon came home
they said:
"there's too much caffeine
in your bloodstream
and a lack of real spice
in your life"
I said:
"leave me alone
because I'm alright, dad
just surprised to still
be on my own...."
Ooh, but don't mention love
I'd hate the real strain of the pain again
a rush and a push and the land that
we stand on is ours
it has been before
so it shall be again
and people who are uglier than you and I
they take what they need, and leave
Ooh, but don't mention love
I'd hate the pain and the strain all over again
a rush and a push and the land that
we stand on is ours
it has been before
so why can't it be now?
and people who are weaker than you and I
they take what they want from life
Ooh, but don't mention love
no - just don't mention love!
a rush and a push and the land that
we stand on is ours
your youth may be gone
but you're still a young man
so phone me, phone me, phone me
so phone me, phone me, phone me
Ooh, I think I'm in love...
Urrgh, I think I'm in lerv

 

I STARTED SOMETHING I COULDN'T FINISH

The lanes were silent
with nothing or no one around for miles
I doused our friendly venture
with a hard-faced
three-word gesture
I started something
I forced you into a zone
and you were clearly
never meant to go
hair brushed and parted
typical me, typical me, typical me
I started something
...and now I'm not too sure
I grabbed you by the guilded beams
that's what Tradition means
and I doused another venture
with a gesture
that was...absolutely vile
I started something
forced you to a zone
and you were clearly
never meant to go
hair brushed and parted
typical me, typical me, typical me
I started something
...and now I'm not too sure
I grabbed you by the guilded beams
that's what Tradition means
and now eighteen months' hard-labour
seems...fair enough
I started something
forced you to a zone
and you were clearly
never meant to go
hair brushed and parted
typical me, typical me, typical me
I started something
and now I'm not too sure

 

DEATH OF A DISCO DANCER

The death of a disco dancer
well, it happens a lot 'round here
and if you think Peace
is a common goal
well, that goes to show
just how little you know
The death of a disco dancer
well, I'd rather not get involved
I never talk to my neighbour
I'd just rather not get involved
Love, peace and harmony?
Love, peace and harmony?
Oh, very nice, very nice, very nice, very nice
...but maybe in the next world.

 

GIRLFRIEND IN A COMA

Girlfriend in a coma, I know
I know - it's serious
Girlfriend in a coma, I know
I know - it's really serious
there wree times when I could
have 'murdered' her
(but, you know, I would hate
anything to happen to her)
NO, I DON'T WANT TO SEE HER
Do you really think
she'll pull through?
Do you really think
she'll pull through?
Girlfriend in a coma, I know
I know, it's serious
there were time when I could
have 'strangeled' her
(but, you know, I would hate
anything to happen to her)
WOULD YOU PLEASE LET ME SEE HER!
Do you really think she'll pull through?
Do you really think she'll pull through?
Let me wisper my last goodbyes
I know - IT'S SERIOUS

 

STOP ME IF YOU'VE HEARD THIS ONE BEFORE

Stop me, stop me,
stop me if you think that you've heard this one before
stop me, stop me
stop me if you think that you've heard this one before
nothing's changed
I still love you, oh I still love you
...only slightly less than I used to
I was delayed, I was way-laid
an emergency stop
I smelt the last ten seconds of life
I crashed down on the crossbar
and the pain was enough to make
a shy, bald buddhist reflect
and plan a mass-murder
who said I'd lied to her?
who said I'd lied because I never
who said I'd lied because I never
I was detained, I was restrained
he broke my spleen
he broke my knees
(and then he really laid into me)
Friday night in Out-patients
who said I'd lied to her?
who said I'd lied - because I never
who said I'd lied - because I never
Oh, so I drank one
or was it four
and when I fell on the floor
...I drank more
stop me, stop me
stop me if you think that you've heard this one before
nothing's changed
I still love you, I still love you
but only slightly
less than I used to

 

LAST NIGHT I DREAMT THAT SOMEBODY LOVED ME

Last night I dreamt
that somebody loved me
no hope - but no harm
just another false alarm
Las night I felt
real arms around me
no hope - no harm
just another false alarm
so, tell me how long
before the last one?
and tell me how long
before the right one?
this story is old - I KNOW
but it goes on
this story is old - I KNOW
but it goes on

 

UNHAPPY BIRTHDAY

I've come to wish you an unhappy birthday
I've come to wish you an unhappy birthday
because you're evil
and you lie
and if you should die
I may feel slightly sad
(but I won't cry)
Loved and lost
and some may say
when usually its Nothing
surely you're happy
it should be this way?
I say "No, I'm gonna kill my dog"
and: "May the lines sag heavy
and deep tonight XXX"
I've come to wish you an unhappy birthday
I've come to wish you an unhappy birthday
because you're evil
and you lie
and if you should die
I may feel slightly sad
(But I won't cry)
Loved and lost
some people say
when usually its Nothing
surely you're happy
it should be this way?
I said "No"
and then I shot myself
so, drink, drink, drink
and be ill tonight
from the one you left behind
from the one you left behind...

 

PAINT A VULGAR PICTURE

At the record company meeting
On their hands - a dead star
and ooh, the plans that they weave
and ooh, the sikening greed
At the record company meeting
on their hands - a dead star
the sycophantic slags all say:
"I knew him first, and I knew him well"
Re-issue! Re-package! Re-package!
Re-evaluate the songs
double-pack with a photograph
Extra Track (and a tacky badge)
A-list, playlist
"Please them, please them!"
"Please them! Please them!"
(sadly, THIS was your life)
but you could have said no
if you'd wanted to
you could have said no
if you'd wanted to
BPI, MTV, BBC
"Please them! Please them!"
(sadly this was your life)
but you could have said no
if you'd wanted to
you could have walked away
...couldn't you?
I touched you at the soundcheck
you had no real way of knowing
in my heart I bgged "please, take
me with you...
I don't care where you're going"
But to you I was faceless
I was fawning, I was boring
just a child from those ugly new houses
who could never begin to know
who could never really know
Best of? Most of?
Satiate the need
slip them into different sleeves!
Buy both, and be decieved
climber - new entry, re-entry
World tour! ("media whore")
"Please the Press in Belgium!"
(THIS was your life...)
and when it fails to recoup?
Well, maybe:
You just haven't earned it yet, baby
I walked a pace behind you at the soundcheck
you're just the same as I am
what makes most people feel happy
leads us headlong into harm
so, in my bedroom in those 'ugly new houses'
I dance my legs down to the knees
but me and my 'true love'
we will never meet again...
At the record company meeting
on their hands - at last! - a dead star!
but they cannot taint you in my eyes
no, they cannout touch you now
No, they cannot hurt you my darling
they cannot touch you now
but me and my 'true love'
will never meet again

 

DEATH AT ONE'S ELBOW

Ooh Glenn, don't come to the house tonight
Ooh, Glenn, don't come to the house tonight
because there's somebody here
who really really loves you
stay home
be bored
(it's crap, I KNOW)
Ooh, Glenn, don't come to the house tonight
Ooh, Glen, don't come to the house tonight
because there's somebody here
who'll take a hatchet to your ear
how the frustration renders me
hateful, Glenn!
don't come to the house tonight
don't come to the house tonight
because you'll slip on the
trail of my bespattered remains
and so, that's why
GOODBYE MY LOVE, GOODBYE MY LOVE, GOODBYE MY LOVE...
Belch

 

I WON'T SHARE YOU

I won't share you
I won't share you
with the drive and ambition
and the zeal I feel
this is my time
as the note I wrote
was read, she said
has the Perrier gone
straight to my head
or is life plainly sick and cruel, instead?
"YES!"
No-no-no-no-no-no
I won't share you
I won't share you
with the drive and the dreams inside
this is my time
Life tends to come and go
well, that's OK
just as long as you know
Life tends to come and go
well, that's OK
just as long as you know
I won't share you
I won't share you
with the drive and the dreams inside
this is my time, this is my time

PANIC

Panic on the streets of London
Panic on the streets of Birmingham
I wonder to myself
Could life ever be sane again
on the Leeds side-streets that you slip down
I wonder to myself
Hopes may rise on the Grasmeres
But Honey Pie, you're not safe here
So you run down
To the safety of the town
But there's Panic on the streets of Carlisle
Dublin, Dundee, Humberside
I wonder to myself
Burn down the Disco
Hang the blessed D.J.
Because the music that they constantly play
IT SAYS NOTHING TO ME ABOUT MY LIFE
Hang the blessed D.J.
Because the music they constantly play
On the Leeds side-streets that you slip down
On the provincial towns that you jog 'round
Hang the D.J.,. Hang the D.J.,.Hang the D.J...

just to set my eyes on a blistering sight
of a vicar in a tu-tu
he's not strange
he just wants to live his life this way
a scanty bit of a thing
with a decorative ring
that wouldn't cover the head of a child
as Rose collects the money in the cannister
who comes sliding down the bannister
the vicar in a tu-tu
he's not strange
he just wants to live his life this way
the monkish monsignor
with a head full of plaster
said "my man, get your vile soul dry-cleaned"
as Rose counts the money in the cannister
as natural as rain
he dances again
vicar in a tu-tu
The next day in the pulpit
with Freedom and Ease
combating ignoranca,dust and disease
as Rose counts the money in the cannister
as natural as rain
he dances again
the fabric of a tu-tu
any man could get us to
and I am a living sign.

 

ASK

Shyness is nice, but
Shyness can stop you
From doing all the things in life
That you'd like to
So, if there's something you'd like to try
ASK ME-I WON'T SAY "NO"-HOW COULD I?
Coyness is nice, but ,
Coyness can stop you
from saying all the things in
life that you want to
If there's something that you'd like to try
ASK ME-I WON'TSAY"NO"-HOW COULD I?
Spending warm, Summer days indoors
Writing fringhtening verse
To a buck-toothed girl in Luxembourg
ASK ME, ASK ME ,ASK ME, ASK ME, ASK ME ,ASK ME
Because if it's not Love
Then it's the Bomb
That will bring us together
Nature is a language-can't you read?
Nature is a language-can't you read?
ASK ME, ASK ME ,ASK ME, ASK ME, ASK ME ,ASK ME
Because if it's not Love
Then it's the Bomb
That will bring us together

 

MARIE'S THE NAME (HIS LATEST FLAME) / RUSHOLME RUFFIANS

Very old friend 
Came by today 
As he was telling everyone in town 
Of all the love that he'd just found 
And Marie's the name (of his latest flame) 
Talked and talked 
And I heard him say 
That she had the longest blackest hair 
Prettiest green eyes anywhere 
And Marie's the name (of his latest flame) 
The last night of the fair 
By the big wheel generator 
A boy is stabbed 
His money is grabbed 
And the air hangs heavy like a dulling wine 
She is Famous 
She is Funny 
An engagement ring 
Doesn't mean a thing 
To a mind consumed by brass (money), oh 
The last night of the fair 
From a seat on a whirling waltzer 
Her skirt ascends for a watching eye 
It's a hideous trait (on her mother's side)
From a seat on a whirling waltzer 
Her skirt ascends for a watching eye 
A hideous trait (on her mother's side) 
Then someone falls in love 
Someone's beaten up 
Someone's beaten up 
And the senses being dulled are mine 
And someone falls in love 
Someone's beaten up 
And the senses being dulled are mine 
This is the last night of the fair 
And the grease in the hair 
Of a speedway operator 
Is all a tremulous heart requires 
A schoolgirl is denied 
She said : "How quickly would I die 
If I jumped from the top of the parachutes ?"
This is the last night of the fair 
And the grease in the hair 
Of a speedway operator 
Is all a tremulous heart requires 
A schoolgirl is denied 
She said : "How quickly would I die 
Oh, if I jumped from the top of the parachutes ?"
...Oh, walk home alone 
I might walk home alone 
But my faith in love is still devout

 

THE BOY WITH THE THORN IN HIS SIDE

The boy with the thorn in his side
behind the hatred there lies
a murderous desire for love
how can they look into my eyes
and still they dont believe me
how can they hear me say those words
and still they dont believe me
and if they don't believe me now
will they ever believe me?
and if they don't believe me now
will they ever believe me?
The boy with the thorn in his side
behind the hatred there lies
a plundering desire for love
how can they see the Love in our eyes
and still they don't believe us
and after all this time
they don't want to believe us
and if they dont believe us now
will they ever believe us ?
andd when you want to Live
how do you start ?
where do you go ?
who do you know?

 

RUBBER RING / WHAT SHE SAID

Yeah! What she says : 
"How come someone hasn't noticed 
That I'm dead 
And decided to bury me ? 
God knows, I'm ready !"
La-la-la ... 
What she said was sad 
But then, all the rejection she's had 
To pretend to be happy 
Could only be idiocy 
La-la-la ... 
What she said was not for the job or 
Lover that she never had 
No no no ... 
What she read 
All heady books 
She'd sit and prophesise 
(It took a tattooed boy from 
Birkenhead 
To really really open her eyes)
What she read 
All heady books 
She'd sit and prophesise 
(It took a tattooed boy from

What she said : 
"I smoke because I'm hoping for an 
Early death 
AND I NEED TO CLING TO SOMETHING !"
What she said :

No no no no ...

 

IS IT REALLY SO STRANGE?

I left the North 
I travelled South 
I found a tiny house 
And I can't help the way I feel 
Oh yes, you can kick me 
And you can punch me 
And you can break my face 
But you won't change the way I feel 
'Cause I love you, Oh ... 
And is it really so strange ? 
Oh, is it really so strange ? 
Oh, is it really so, really so strange ? 
I say NO, you say YES 
(and you will change your mind) 
I left the South 
I travelled North 
I got confused - I killed a horse 
I can't help the way I feel 
Oh yes, you can punch me 
And you can butt me 
And you can break my spine 
But you won't change the way I feel 
'Cause I love you, Oh ... 
And is it really so strange ? 
Oh, is it really so strange ? 
Oh, is it really so, really so strange ? 
I say NO, you say YES 
(But you will change your mind) 
I left the North again 
I travelled South again 
And I got confused - I killed a nun 
I CAN'T HELP THE WAY I FEEL 
(I lost my bag in Newport Pagnell) 
Why is the last mile the hardest mile ? 
My throat was dry, with the sun in my eyes 
And I realised, I realised 
I could never 
I could never, never, never, go back home again

 

CEMETERY GATES

A dreaded sunny day
so I meet you at the cemetry gates
Keats and Yeats are on your side
A dreaded sunny day
so I meet you at the cemetry gates
Keats and Yeats are on your side
while Wilde is on mine
So we go inside and we gravely read the stones
all those people all those lives
where are they now ?
with loves, and hates
and passions just like mine
they were born
and then they lived and then they died
which seems so unfair
and I wantr to crv
You say: "ere thrice the sun hath done salutation to the dawn"
and you claim these words as your own
but Im well-read, have heard them said
a hundred times (maybe less, maybe more)
if you must write prose/poems
the words you use should be your own
dont plagiarise or take "on loans"
there's alweays someone, somewhere
with a big nose, who knows
and who trips you up and laughs
when you fall
You say: "ere long done do does did "
words which could only be your own
you then produce the text
from whence was ripped
(some dizzy whore, 1804)
A dreaded sunny day
so let's go where we're happy
so I meet you at the cemetry gates
Keats and Yeats are on your side
A dreaded sunny day
so let's go where we're wanted
so I meet you at the cemetry gates
Keats and Yeats are on your side
but you lose
because Wilde is on mine

 

LONDON

Smoke
Lingers 'round your fingers
Train
Heave on - to Euston
Do you think you've made
The right decision this time?
You left
Your tired family grieving
And you think they're sad because you're leaving
But didn't you see the Jealousy in the eyes
Of the ones who had to stay behind?
And do you think you've made
The right decision thins time?
You left
Your girlfriend on the platform
With thei really ragged notion that you'll return
But she knows
That when he goes
He really goes
So do you think you've made
The right decision this time?

 

I KNOW IT'S OVER

I can feel the soil falling over my head 
And as I climb into an empty bed 
Oh well. Enough said. 
I know it's over - still I cling 
I don't know where else I can go 
Over ... 
Oh Mother, I can feel the soil falling over my head 
See, the sea wants to take me 
The knife wants to cut me 
Do you think you can help me ? 
Sad veiled bride, please be happy 
Handsome groom, give her room 
Loud, loutish lover, treat her kindly 
(Though she needs you 
More than she loves you) 
And I know it's over - still I cling 
I don't know where else I can go 
Over, it's over, it's over, it's over 
It's over, la ... 
I know it's over 
And it never really began 
But in my heart it was so real
And you even spoke to me, and said : 
"If you're so funny 
Then why are you on your own tonight ? 
And if you're so clever 
Then why are you on your own tonight ? 
I know ... 
'Cause tonight - it's just like any other night 
That's why you're on your own tonight 
Your triumphs and your charms 
While they're in each other's arms..."
It's so easy to laugh 
It's so easy to hate 
It takes strength to be gentle and kind 
Over, over, over, over 
It's so easy to laugh 
It's so easy to hate 
It takes guts to be gentle and kind 
Over, over 
Love is Natural and Real 
But not for you, my love 
Not tonight, my love 
Love is Natural and Real 
But not for such as you and I, my love 
Oh Mother, I can feel the soil falling over my head...
Oh Mother, I can feel the soil fall over, fall over my head 
Oh Mother, I can feel the ... fall over my ... , Oh ...

 

THE DRAIZE TRAIN

A vastly superior version of the instrumental B-side, acting as a peace 
offering to Marr (Morrissey chose the tracks for the compilation, 
and of course, receives no royalties on this track).

 

STILL ILL

I decree today that life
is simply taking and not giving
England is mine and it owes me a living
ask me why, and I'll spit in your eye
ask me why, and I'll spit in your eye
but we cannot cling to the old dreams anymore
no, we cannot cling to the old dreams anymore
Does the body rule the mind
or does the mind rule the body?
I dunno...
Under the iron bridge we kissed
and although I ended up with sore lips
it just wasn't like the old days anymore
no, it wasn't like those days
am I still ill?
Does the body rule the mind
or does the mind rule the body ?
I dunno...
Ask me why, and I'll die
ask me why, and I'll die
and if you must go to work tomorrow
well, if I were you I wouldn't bother
for there are brighter sides to life
and I should know because I've seen them
but not very often...
under the iron bridge we kissed
and although I ended up with sore lips
it just wasn't like the old days anymore
no, it wasn't like those days
am I still ill?

 

BIGMOUTH STRIKES AGAIN

Sweetness, sweetness I was only joking
when I said Id like to smash every tooth
in your head
Sweetness, sweetness I was only joking
when I said by right s you should be
bludgeoned in your bed
and now I know how Joan of Arc felt
now I know how Joan of Arc felt
as the flames roseto her roman nose
and her Walkman stared to melt
Bibmouth, bigmouth
bigmouth strikes again
and Ive got no right to take my place
with the Human race
and now I know how Joan of Arc felt
now I know of Joan of Arc felt
as the flames rose to her roman nose
and her hearing aid started to melt
Bigmouth, bigmouth
bigmouth strikes again
and Ive got no right to take my place
with the Human race

 
ALSATIAN COUSTIN

Were you and he Lovers?
and would you say so if you were?
on a forecourt
on a Friday
passing my way
Were you and he Lovers?
and if you were, then say that you were!
on a groundsheet
under canvas
with your tent-flap
open wide
A note upon his desk:
"P.S. Bring Me Home And Have Me!"
Leather elbows on a tweed coat
- Oh! -
Is THAT the best you can do?
So came his reply:
"...but on the desk is where I want you!"
So I ask (even though I know):
were you and he Lovers?

 

LITTLE MAN, WHAT NOW?

An afternoon nostalgia
television show
you spoke in silhouette
(but they couldn't name you)
although the panel were
very polite to you
but I remembered you
from Friday nights 1969
ATV - you murdered every line
too old to be a child star
too young to take leads
four seasons passed
and they AXED you
nervously juvenile
(WON'T SMILE!)
What became of you?
did that swift eclipse torture you?
a star at eighteen
and then-suddenly gone
down to a few lines
in the back page of a teenage annual
oh but I remembered you
I looked up to you

 

EVERYDAY IS LIKE SUNDAY

Trudging slowly over wet sand
back to the bench
where your clothes were stolen
this is the coastal town
that they forgot to close down
Armageddon - come Armageddon!
Come Armageddon! Come!
Everyday is like Sunday
everyday is silent and grey
Hide on the promenade
scratch out a postcard
"how I dearly with I was not here"
in the seaside town
...that they forgot to bomb
Come! Come! Come - nuclear bomb!
Everyday is like Sunday
everyday is silent and grey
Trudging back over pebbles and sand
and a strange dust lands on your hands
(and on your face)
Everyday is like Sunday
"Win Yourself A Cheap Tray"
share some greased tea with me
everyday is silent and grey

 

BENGALI IN PLATFORMS

No no no
he does not want to depress you
oh no no no no no
he only wants to impress you
Bengali in platform
she only wants to embrace your culture
and to be your friend forever
Bengali, Bengali
oh shelve your Western plans
and understand that life is hard enough when you belong here
A silver-studded rim that glistens
and an ankle-star that...blinds me
a lemon sole so very high
which only reminds me, to tell you
so I break the news gently
I break the news to you gently
"Shelve your plans"
Bengali, Bengali
its the touchy march of time
that blinds you
don't blame me
don't hate me
just because I'm the one to tell you
that life is hard enough when you belong here
life is hard enough when you belong here
shelve your western plans
life is hard enough when you belong here

 

ANGEL, ANGEL, DOWN WE GO TOGETHER

Angel, Angel
don't take your life tonight
I know they take
and that they take in turn
and they give you nothing real
for yourself in return
and when they've used you
and they've broken you
and wasted all your money
and cast your shell aside
and when they've bought you
and they've sold you
and they've billed you for the pleasure
and they've made your parents cry
I will be here
BELIEVE ME
I will be here
...believe me
Angel, don't take your life
some people have got no pride
they do not understand
the Urgency of life
but I love you more than life
I love you more than life
I love you more than life
I love you more than life

 

LALE NIGHT, MAUDLIN STREET

The last night on Maudlin Street
goodbye house
goodbye stairs
I was born here
I was raised here, and
...I took some stick here
love at first sight
may sound trite
but it's true, you know
I could list the details
of everything you ever wore
or said, or how you stood that day
and as we spend the last night
on Maudlin Street, I say
"goodbye house-forever!"
I never stole a happy hour
around here
Where the world's ugliest boy
became what you see
here I am - the ugliest man
Its the last night on Maudlin Street
and truly I do love you
oh, truly I do love you
When I sleep with that picture of
you framed beside my bed
oh, it's childish and it's silly
but I think it's you in my room
by the bed (...yes, I told you it was silly...)
and I know
I took strange pills
but I never meant to hurt you
oh truly I love you
I came home late one night
everyone had gone to bed
nobody stays up for you
when you have sixteen stitches
all around your head
the last buss I missed to Maudlin Street
so, he drove me home in the Van
complaining: "Women only like me for my mind..."
don't leave your torch behind
power-cuts ahead
as we crept through the park
but no I cannot steal a pair of jeans
off a clothesline for you
but you...without clothes
oh I could not keep a straight face
me - without clothes?
well a nation turns its back and gags...
I'm packed
I am moving house
a half-life disappears today
every slag waves me on
(secretly wishing me gone
well, I will be soon
oh - I will be soon)
There were bad times on Maudlin Street
when they took you away in a police car
dear Inspector - don't you know?
don't you care?
don't you know - about Love?
Your gran died
and your mother died
on Maudlin Street
in pain and ashamed
with never time to say
those special things
I took the keys from Maudlin Street
well, it's only bricks and mortar!
and...truly I do love you
wherever you are
wherever you are

 

SUEDHEAD

Why do you come here
why do you hang around
I'm so sorry
I'm so sorry
Why do you come here
when you know it makes
things hard for me
when you know, oh
why do you come?
Why do you telephone?
and why send me silly notes?
I'm so sorry
I'm so sorry
why do you come here
when you know it makes
thing hard for me
when you know, oh
why do you come?
You had to sneak into my room
'just' to read my diary
was it just to see all the things
you knew I'd written about you?
and...so many illustrations
I'm so very sickened
oh, I am so sickened NOW

 

BREAK UP THE FAMILY

The strange logic of your clumsiest line
stayed emblazoned on my mind
break up the family
and lets begin to live our lives
I went to see all my friends tonight
it wasn't Youth, it wasn't even Life
born Old, sadly wise
resigned (well, we were)
to ending our lives
I'm so glad to grow older
to move away from those awful times
I want to see all my friends tonight
Yes you found love but you weren't
at peace with your life
home late, full of Hate
despise the ties that bind
oh I'm so glad to grow older
to move away from those younger years
now I'm in love for the first time
and I don't feel bad
Let me see all my old friends
let me put my arm around them
because I really do love them
now, does that sound mad?
Captain of games, solid framed
I stood on the touchline
hailstones, driven home
in his car - no breaks? I don't mind
I'm just so glad to grow older
to move away from those darker years
I'm in love for the first time
and I don't feel bad
so wish me luck my friends
goodbye

 

HAIRDRESSER ON FIRE

Here is London
here is London
is it home of the free,
or what?
can you squeeze me
into an empty page of your diary
and psychologically save me
I've got faith in you
I sense the power
in the fingers
within an hour the power
can totally destroy me
or it could same my life
here is London
'home of the brash, outrageous
and free'
you are repressed
but you're remarkably dressed
is it Real?
but you're far to busy
busy scissors
busy clippers
hair dresser on fire
all around Sloane Square
and you're far too busy
to see me
"busy,busy"
hairdresser on fire
was a client over-cautious
he made you nervous
and when he said
"I'm gonna sue you"
I really felt for you
so can you squeeze me
into an empty page of your diary
and supernaturally change me
CHANGE ME, CHANGE ME

 

THE ORDINARY BOYS

Ordinary boys, happy knowing nothing
happy being no one, but themselves
Ordinary girls, supermarket clothes
who think it's very clever to be cruel to you
for you were so different
you stood all alone
and you knew
that it had to be so
avoiding ordinary boys
happy going nowhere, just around here
in their rattling cars
and ordinary girls
never seeing further
than the cold, small streets
that trap them
but you were so different
you had to say no
when those empty fools
tried to change you, and claim you
for the lair of their ordinary world
where they feel so lucky
so lucky, so lucky
with their lives laid out before them
they're so lucky, so lucky
so lucky, so lucky

 

I DON'T MIND IF YOU FORGET ME

I don't mind
I don't mind if you forget me
having learned my lesson
I never left an impression on anyone
so now you send me your hardened 'regards'
when once you'd send me 'love'
sincerely I must tell you
your mild 'best wishes'
they make me suspicious
but I don't mind
I don't mind if you forget me
having learned my lesson
I never left
an impression on anyone
the pressure to change, to move on
was strange
and very strong
so this is why I tell you
I really do understand
BYE BYE
I don't mind if you forget me
no no no no no no no
REJECTION IS ONE THING
BUT REJECTION FROM A FOOL
IS CRUEL
REJECTION IS ONE THING
BUT REJECTION FROM A FOOL
IS CRUEL
and I don't mind if you forget me
I don't mind if your forget me

 

DIAL-A-CLICHE

Further into the fog I fall
well, I was just
following you!
when you said:
"Do as I do and scrap your fey ways"
(dial-a-cliche)
"grow up, be a man, and close your mealy-mouth!"
(dial-a-cliche)
But the person underneath
where does he go?
does he slide by the wayside?
or...does he just die?
when you find that you've organized
your feelings, for people
who didn't like you then
and certainly don't like you now
yet still you say:
"Do as I do and scrap your fey ways"
(dial-a-cliche)
"grow up, be a man, and close your mealy-mouth!"
(dial-a-cliche)
"the Safe way is the only way!
there's always time to change, son!"
yes well I've changed
but I'm in pain!
dial-a-chiche

 

MARGARET ON THE GUILLOTINE

The kind people
have a wonderful dream
Margaret on the guillotine
because people like you
make me feel so tired
when will you die?
when will you die?
when will you die?
when will you die?
when will you die?
because people like you
make me feel so old inside
please die
and kind people
do not shelter this dream
make it real
make the dream real
make the dream real
make it real

 

OUR FRANK

Our frank and open
deep conversations
they get me nowhere
they bring me down, so
give it a rest, won't you?
give me a cigarette
God give me patience
just no more conversation
Give us a drink
and make it quick
or else I'm gonna be sick
sick all over
your frankly vulgar
red pullover
now see how the colours blend
Our frank and open
deep conversations
they get me nowhere
they bring me down, so
give it a rest, won't you?
now will you just give over
the world may be ending
but look, I'm only human
Give us a drink
and make it quick
or else I'm gonna be sick
all over
your frankly vulgar
red pullover
now see how the two colours blend
Won't somebody stop me
from thinking all the time
about everything
so deeply
so bleakly

 

ASIAN RUT

Day oh so late
strangely the sun still shone
oh Asian boy
what are you on?
Day oh so late
strangely the sun still shone
what drugs are you on?
Tooled-up Asian boy
has come here to avenge
the cruel, cold killing
of his very best friend
Tooled-up Asian boy
has come here to take revenge
for the cruel, cold killing
of his only friend
Peace through the school
so quiet in the hall
it's a strange sign for one
of what's to come
Tough and hard and pale
oh they may just impale you on railings
oh English boys
it must be wrong
three against one?
Brakes slammed, and
a gun jammed, and
as far as I could tell
brave Asian boy
dealt a blow and fell
I'm just passing through here
on my way to somewhere civilised
and maybe I'll even arrive
maybe I'll even arrive?

 

SING YOUR LIFE

Sing your life
any fool can think of words that rhyme
many others do
why don't you?
do you want to?
Sing your life
just walk right up to the microphone
and name
all the things that you love
all the things that you loathe
sing your life
all the things that you love
all the things that you loathe
oh sing your life
oh sing your life
Others sang your life
but now's your chance to shine
and have the pleasure of
saying what you mean
the rare pleasure of
meaning what you sing
oh, make no mistake, my friend
all of this will end
so sing it now
all the things you love
all the things you loathe
oh sing your life
all the things that you love
all the things that you loathe
oh sing your, oh sing your
Don't leave it all unsaid
somewhere in the wasteland of your head
and make no mistake, my friend
your pointless life will end
but before you go
can you look at the truth?
You have a lovely singing voice
a lovely singing voice
and all of those
who sing on key
they stole the notion
from you and me

 

MUTE WITNESS

Your poor witness
crying so loudly on the floor
oh but she's only trying to tell you
what it was that she saw
she is only trying to tell you
what it was that she saw
Now see her standing on the table
with her small arms flailing
and you feel such compassion
in your soul for
Your poor mute witness
still testing the strength
of our patience
oh but she's only trying to tell you
what it was that she saw
Now see her pointing to the frisbee
with a memory too fuzzy
as her silent words
describe the fright of last night
4 a.m. Norhtside, Clapham Common
who knows what she was doing there?
will she sketch the answer later?
Well, I'll ask her
"now dry your tears, my dear"
Now see her mime in time so nicely
it would all have been so clear
is only she had never volunteered
"your taxi is here, my dear"

 

KING LEER

Your boyfriend, he
went down on one knee
well, could it be
he's only got one knee?
I tried to surprise you
with Vodka
or, Tizer
I can't quite remember
but you didn't thank me
you didn't even thank me
because you never do
Your boyfriend, he
has the gift of the gab
or, could it be
the gift of the grab?
I tried to surprise you
I lay down beside you
and...nothing much happened
and you didn't phone me
you didn't even phone me
because it's not your style
to dial
Your boyfriend, he
displays to me
more than just
a hint of cruelty
I tried to surprise you
I crept up behind you
with a homeless chihuahua
you gushed for an hour
you handed him back and said
"You'll never guess
I'm bored now"

found found found found found found
someone who's worth it

seeming scheming
Oh, but if I'd never found
oh, but if I'd never found
oh, but if I'd never found
I do believe that
the more you give your love
and I do believe that
the more you offer trust
the more you chase
the more you cry
the more you're bound to lose
the more you're bound to lose
Oh, but if I'd never found
oh, but if I'd never found
somebody
who wants to be
who wants to be
with me
all the time

 

DRIVING YOUR GIRLFRIEND HOME

I'm driving
your girlfriend home
and she's saying
how she never chose you
"turn left", she says
so I turn left
and she says
"So how did I end up
so deeply involved in
the very existence
I planned on avoiding?"
and I can't answer
I'm driving
your girlfriend home
and she's laughing
to stop herself crying
"drive on", she says
so I drive on
and she says
"So how did I end up
attached to this person
when his sense of humour
gets gradually worser?"
and I can't tell her
I'm parking
outside her home
and we're shaking hands
goodnight, so politely

 

THE HARSH TRUTH OF THE CAMERA EYE

Churchillian legs
hair barely there
the harsh truth of the camera eye
Your eyes signal pain
because of the strain
of smiling
the harsh truth of the camera eye
telling you all
that you never wnated to know
showing what
you didn't want shown
My so friendly lens
zooms into
"the inner you"
and it tells the harsh truth
and nothing but
Laugh with us all here
that's if you can
then take the pictures home
and screamtelling you all
that you never wanted to know
showing you what
you didn't want shown
This photographer
he must have really had it in for you
"Oh, I don't want
to be judged anymore
I don't wnat to be judged
I would sooner be Loved
I would sooner be
just blindly Loved..."

 

(I'M) THE END OF THE FAMILY LINE

With no complications
fifteen generations
(of mine)
all honouring Nature
until I arrive
(with incredible style)
I'm the end fo the line
the end of the family line
the end of the line
No baby pulled screaming
out into this seething whirl
by chance or whim
(or even love?)
our family tree hacked into decline
and I'm spared the pain
of ever saying
("goodbye")
I'm the end of the line
the end of the family line
the end of the line

 

THERE'S A PLACE IN HELL FOR ME AND MY FRIENDS

There is a place
reserved
for me and my friends
and when we go
we all will go
so you see
I'm never alone
there is a place
with a bit more time
and a few more
gentler words
and looking back
we do forgive
(we had no choice
we always did)
all that we hope
is that when we go
our skin
and our blood
and our bones
don't get in your way
making you ill
the way they did
when we lived
There is a place
a place in hell
reserved
for me and my friends
and if ever I
wanted to cry
then I will
because I can

 

TONY THE PONY

Still drinking on the corner 
Just don't say I didn't warn you 
Always nagging big brother 
He's only looking out for you 
Tony The Pony 
Tony The Pony 
You're still standing on the corner 
Just don't say I didn't warn you 
Old and jealous big brother 
You had your time and you spent it 
Crying 
Now, Tony The Pony 
Tony The Pony 
So, that's what they call you now ? 
When you're free outside 
So cold and hard and in control 
And ... 
There's a free ride on 
Tony The Pony 
Oh, why do you always wanna stop me 
From doing the things in life that make me happy ? 
And when I'm outside with friends, laughing loudly 
Why do you always wanna stop me ? 
Oh, I would never 
I would never 
But you will carry the can for anyone 
The free ride on 
Gullible Tony 
You're drunker quicker 
And you're sicker even quicker 
For something heavy is gonna fall on you 
Oh ... 
And what do they call you now ? 
When you're free outside 
So cold and hard and in control 
And, oh ... been a lark 
There's a free ride on 
Fucked-up Tony 
I will never say I told you so 
Or how I knew that something bad 
Would happen to you 
I don't wanna say I told you so 
Oh, but Tony, I told you so !!! 
I told you so

 

YOU'RE GONNA NEED SOMEONE ON YOUR SIDE

With the world's fate 
Resting on your shoulder 
You're gonna need 
Someone on your side 
You can't do it by yourself 
Any longer 
You're gonna need 
Someone on your side 
Someone kindly told me 
That you'd wasted 
Eight of nine lives
Oh, give yourself a break 
Before you break down 
You're gonna need someone on your side 
And here I am, And here I am 
Well, you don't need 
To look so pleased ! 
Day or night, 
There is no difference 
You're gonna need someone on your side 
Day or night, 
There is no difference 
You're gonna need someone soon 
And here I am, And here I am 
Well, you don't need 
To look so pleased

 

GLAMOROUS GLUE

First day with the jar 
You find 
Everyone lies 
First day with the jar 
You find 
Everyone lies, nobody minds 
Everyone lies 
Where is the man you respect ? 
And where is the woman you love ? 
Where's the woman you love ? 
Third week with the jar
You find 
Everything dies 
We won't vote Conservative 
Because we never have 
Everyone lies, everyone lies 
Where is the man you respect ? 
And where is the woman you love ? 
Where's the woman you love ? 
Everything of worth 
On Earth Is there To share 
I used to dream, and I used to vow 
I wouldn't dream of it now 
We look to Los Angeles 
For the language we use 
London is dead, London is dead, London is dead...
Now I'm too much in love 
I'm too much in love 
I know 
I'll go 
Empty hand 
From the land

 

WE'LL LET YOU KNOW

How sad are we ? 
And how sad have we been ? 
We'll let you know 
We'll let you know 
Oh, but only if - you're really interested 
You wonder how 
We've stayed alive 'till now 
We'll let you know 
We'll let you know 
But only if - you're really interested 
We're all smiles 
Then, honest, I swear, it's the turnstiles 
That make us hostile 
Oh ... 
We will descend 
On anyone unable to defend 
Themselves 
Oh ... 
And the songs we sing 
They're not supposed to mean a thing 
La, la, la, la ... 
Oh ...You're lonely, Oh ... you're lonely, Oh ... 
GET OFF THE ROOF ! Oh ... 
Your Arsenal !
We may seem cold, or 
We may even be 
The most depressing people you've ever known 
At heart, what's left, we sadly know 
That we are the last truly British people you'll ever know 
We are the last truly British people you will ever know 
You'll never never want to know

 

THE NATIONAL FRONT DISCO

David, the wind blows 
The wind blows ... 
Bits of your life away 
Your friends all say ... 
"Where is our boy ? Oh, we've lost our boy" 
But they should know 
Where you've gone 
Because again and again you've explained that 
You're going to ... 
Oh, you're going to ... 
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah 
England for the English ! 
England for the English ! 
David, the winds blow 
The winds blow ...
All of my dreams away 
And I still say : 
"Where is our boy ? Ah, we've lost our boy" 
But I should know 
Why you've gone 
Because again and again you've explained
You've gone to the ... 
National, ah ... 
To the National .. 
There's a country; you don't live there 
But one day you would like to 
And if you show them what you're made of 
Oh, then you might do ... 
But David, we wonder 
We wonder if the thunder 
Is ever really gonna begin 
Begin, begin 
Your mom says : 
"I've lost my boy" 
But she should know 
Why you've gone 
Because again and again you've explained 
You've gone to the : 
National 
To the National 
To the National Front Disco 
Because you want the day to come sooner 
You want the day to come sooner 
You want the day to come sooner 
When you've settled the score 
Oh, the National 
Oh, the National

 

CERTAIN PEOPLE I KNOW

I take the cue from 
Certain people I know 
I use the cue 
And then I 
Hand it on to you 
And when I swing it 
So, it catches his eye ... 
(Weren't you there ? 
- You'd have died !) 
I trust the views of 
Certain people I know 
They look at Danger 
And they 
LAUGH THEIR HEADS OFF 
Their clothes are Imitation 
George the 23rd 
(Don't you find this absurd ?) 
I'd hate to be like 
Certain people I know 
They break their necks 
And can't afford to
Get them fixed 
Ah, they'd sacrifice all 
Of their principles for 
anything cashable 
I do believe it's terrible 
Oh, wo, wo, Ah, ah, ah, ah, Oh, wo, wo...

 

WE HATE IT WHEN OUR FRIENDS BECOME SUCCESSFUL

We hate it when our friends become successful 
We hate it when our friends become successful 
Oh, look at those clothes 
Now look at that face, it's so old 
And such a video ! 
Well, it's really laughable 
Ha, ha, ha ...
We hate it when our friends become successful 
And if they're Northern, that makes it even worse
And if we can destroy them 
You bet your life we will 
Destroy them 
If we can hurt them 
Well, we may as well ... 
It's really laughable 
Ha, ha, ha ... 
You see, it should've been me 
It could've been me 
Everybody knows 
Everybody says so 
They say : 
"Ah, you have loads of songs 
So many songs 
More songs than they'd stand 
Verse 
Chorus 
Middle eight 
Break, fade 
Just listen ..."
La, la-la, la-la

SEASICK, YET STILL DOCKED

I am a poor freezingly cold soul 
So far from where 
I intended to go 
Scavenging through life's very constant lulls 
So far from where I'm determined to go 
Wish I knew the way to reach the one I love
There is no way ... 
Wish I had the charm to attract the one I love 
But you see, I've got no charm 
Mmm...
Tonight I've consumed much more than I can hold 
Oh, this is very clear to you 
And you can tell I have never really loved 
You can tell, by the way, I sleep all day
And all of my life no-one gave me anything 
No-one has ever given me anything 
My love is as sharp as a needle in your eye 
You must be such a fool 
To pass me by

 

I KNOW IT'S GONNA HAPPEN SOMEDAY

My love, wherever you are 
Whatever you are 
Don't lose faith 
I know it's gonna happen someday 
To you 
Please wait ... Please wait ... Oh ... Wait ... 
Don't lose faith 
You say that the day just never arrives 
And it's never seemed so far away 
Still, I know it's gonna happen someday 
To you 
Please wait ... 
Don't lose faith

 

TOMORROW

Tomorrow 
Will it really come ? 
And if it does come 
Will I still be Human ? 
All I ask of you is one thing that you never do 
Would you put your arms around me ? 
(I won't tell anyone) 
Tomorrow 
Does it have to come ?
All I ask of you is one thing that you'll never do 
Would you put your arms around me ? 
(I won't tell anybody) 
Tomorrow 
And what must come before ...
Oh, the pain in my arms 
Oh, the pain in my legs 
Ooh, my shiftless body 
Tomorrow 
It's surely nearer now ? 
You don't think I'll make it 
I never said I wanted to ! 
Well did I ? 
Oh, the pain in my arms 
Oh, the pain in my legs 
Oh, yeah; oh, yeah, No, yeah; no, yeah 
Through my shiftless body 
Tomorrow, Tomorrow 
All I ask of you ... oh ... 
Is : would you tell me that you love me 
Tell me, tell me that you love me, Tell me, tell me that you love me ... 
Ah, I know you don't mean it 
Ah, I know you don't mean it 
Tell me, tell me that you love me, Tell me, tell me that you love me ...

NOVEMBER SPAWNED A MONSTER

Sleep on and dream of Love
because it's the closest you will get to love
poor twisted child, so ugly, so ugly
poor twisted child, oh hug me, oh hug me
one November spawned a monster 
in the shape of this child who later cried
"But Jesus made me, so Jesus save me from
pity, sympathy and people discussing me"
a frame of useless limbs what can make GOOD
all the BAD that's been done?
And if the lights were out
could you even bear
to kiss her full on the mouth (or anywhere?)
poor twisted child, so ugly, so ugly
poor twisted child, oh hug me, oh hug me
one November spawned a monster 
in the shape of this child who must remain
a hostage to kindess and the wheels underneath her
a hostage to kindess and the wheels underneath her
a symbol of where mad, mad lovers
must PAUSE and draw the line
So sleep and dream of love
because it's the closest
you will get to love
that November is a time which I must put OUT of my mind
oh one fine day 
LET IT BE SOON
she won't be rich or beautiful
but she'll be walking your streets
in the clothes that she went out
and chose for herself

 

SEASICK, YET STILL DOCKED

I am a poor freezingly cold soul

THE LOOP

I just wanna say 
I haven't been away 
I'm still right here 
Where I always was 
So one day, if you're bored 
By all means call 
Because you can do 
(But only if you want to) 
I just wanna say 
I haven't been away 
I am still right here 
Where I always was 
So one day, when you're bored 
By all means call 
Because you can do 
But you might not get through

 

SISTER I'M A POET

All over this town 
Yes, a low wind may blow 
And I can see through everybo... 
With no reason 
To hide these words I feel 
And no reason 
To talk about the books I read 
But still I do 
That's 'cause I'm a ... Sister I'm a ... 
All over this town 
Along this way 
Outside the prison gates 
I love the romance of crime 
And I wonder 
Does anybody feel the way I do ? 
And is evil just something you are 
Or something you do ? 
Sister I'm a ... Sister I'm a ... 
All over this town, All over this town 
They pull over 
In their Citroen vans 
Not to shake your hand 
With meths on their breaths 
And you with youth on your side 
A plastic bag stranded at the lights 
This once was me ...
But now I'm a ... Sister I'm a ...
All over this town ... Oh, oh, oh 
All over this town, All over this town, Oh ... 
I still cannot speak French ... I am very lazy

 

JACK THE RIPPER

Oh, you look so tired 
Mouth slack and wide 
Ill-housed and ill-advised 
Your face is as mean 
As your life has been 
Crash into my arms 
I WANT YOU 
You don't agree -
But you don't refuse 
I know you 
And I know a place 
Where no one is likely to pass 
Oh, you don't care if it's late 
And you don't care if you're lost 
And oh, you look so tired 
(But tonight you presumed too much) 
Too much, too much 
And if it's the last 
Thing I ever do 
I'M GONNA GET YOU 
Crash into my arms 
I WANT YOU 
You don't agree -
But you don't refuse 
I know you 
And no one knows a thing about my life 
I can come and go as I please 
And if I want to, I can stay 
Oh, or if I want to, I can leave 
Nobody knows me, Nobody knows me, Nobody knows me Oh, oh...

 

SUCH A LITTLE THING MAKES SUCH A BIG DIFFERENCE

Such a little thing, such a little thing
but the difference it made was grave
there you go
wielding a bicycle chain
oh why won't you change
cange and be nicer?
such a little thing
a gentle tone of kindness
or written words on paper
- can you write?
How I love all of
the very simple things of life
(God's good air)
how I love all of
the very simple things of life
such a little thing
a fumbling politeness
the difference it saved me
wielding a bicycle chain
"I WILL NOT CHANGE AND I WILL NOT BE NICE"
Most people keep their brains between your legs (don't you find?)
Leave me alone - I was only singing, leave me alone because
I was only singing
leave me alone - I was only singing, leave me alone
you have just proved (again)
MOST PEOPLE KEEP THEIR BRAINS BETWEEN THEIR LEGS

 

I KNOW IT'S GONNA HAPPEN SOMEDAY

My love, wherever you are 
Whatever you are 
Don't lose faith 
I know it's gonna happen someday 
To you 
Please wait ...

Oh ... Wait ... 
Don't lose faith 
You say that the day just never arrives 
And it's never seemed so far away 
Still, I know it's gonna happen someday 
To you 
Please wait ... 
Don't lose faith

 

WE'LL LET YOU KNOW

How sad are we ? 
And how sad have we been ? 
We'll let you know, We'll let you know 
Oh, but only if - you're really interested 
You wonder how 
We've stayed alive 'till now 
We'll let you know, We'll let you know 
But only if - you're really interested 
We're all smiles 
Then, honest, I swear, it's the turnstiles 
That make us hostile 
Oh ... We will descend 
On anyone unable to defend 
Themselves 
Oh ... And the songs we sing 
They're not supposed to mean a thing 
La, la, la, la ... Oh ...
You're lonely, Oh ... you're lonely 
Oh ... 
GET OFF THE ROOF !
Oh ... Your Arsenal !
We may seem cold, or 
We may even be 
The most depressing people you've ever known 
At heart, what's left, we sadly know 
That we are the last truly British people you'll ever know 
We are the last truly British people you will ever know 
You'll never never want to know

 

SUEDHEAD

Why do you come here
why do you hang around
I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry
Why do you come here
when you know it makes
things hard for me
when you know, oh
why do you come?
Why do you telephone?
and why send me silly notes?
I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry
why do you come here
when you know it makes
thing hard for me
when you know, oh
why do you come?
You had to sneak into my room
'just' to read my diary
was it just to see all the things
you knew I'd written about you?
and...so many illustrations
I'm so very sickened
oh, I am so sickened NOW

 

HE KNOWS I'D LOVE TO SEE HIM

He Knows (he knows)
Or, I think he does
because when I lived
in the Arse of the world...
he knows, he knows, he knows I'd love
to see him happy (or as close as is allowed)
because when I lived
in the Arse of the world
he knows, he knows, he knows I'd love
to see him happy (or as close as possible
as close as possible, as close as is allowed)
My name still conjours up deadly deeds
and a bad taste in the mouth
the police - they actually knew me
they said:
"You're just another person in the world
you're just another fool with radical views
you're just another who has maddening views
you want to turn it on its head
by staying in bed!"
I said: "I know I do"

 

YOU'RE GONNA NEED SOMEONE ON YOUR SIDE

With the world's fate 
Resting on your shoulder 
You're gonna need 
Someone on your side 
You can't do it by yourself 
Any longer 
You're gonna need 
Someone on your side 
Someone kindly told me 
That you'd wasted 
Eight of nine lives
Oh, give yourself a break 
Before you break down 
You're gonna need someone on your side 
And here I am, And here I am 
Well, you don't need 
To look so pleased ! 
Day or night, 
There is no difference 
You're gonna need someone on your side 
Day or night, 
There is no difference 
You're gonna need someone soon 
And here I am, And here I am 
Well, you don't need 
To look so pleased

Oh, look at those clothes 
Now look at that face, it's so old 
And such a video ! 
Well, it's really laughable 
Ha, ha, ha ...
We hate it when our friends become successful 
And if they're Northern, that makes it even worse
And if we can destroy them 
You bet your life we will 
Destroy them 
If we can hurt them 
Well, we may as well ... 
It's really laughable 
Ha, ha, ha ... 
You see, it should've been me 
It could've been me 
Everybody knows 
Everybody says so 
They say : 
"Ah, you have loads of songs 
So many songs 
More songs than they'd stand 
Verse 
Chorus 
Middle eight 
Break, fade 
Just listen ..."
La, la-la, la-la

 

NOW MY HEART IS FULL

There's gonna be some trouble 
A whole house will need re-building 
And everyone I love in the house 
Will recline on an analyst's couch quite 
Soon 
Your Father cracks a joke 
And in the usual way 
Empties the room 
Tell all of my friends 
(I don't have too many 
Just some rain-coated lovers' puny brothers)
Dallow, Spicer, Pinkie, Cubitt 
Rush to danger 
Wind up nowhere 
Patric Doonan - raised to wait 
I'm tired again, I've tried again, and 
Now my heart is full 
Now my heart is full 
And I just can't explain 
So I won't even try to
Dallow, Spicer, Pinkie, Cubitt 
Every jammy Stressford poet 
Loafing oafs in all-night chemists 
Loafing oafs in all-night chemists 
Underact - express depression 
Ah, but Bunnie I loved you 
I was tired again 
I've tried again, and 
Now my heart is full 
Now my heart is full 
And I just can't explain 
So I won't even try to 
Could you pass by ? 
Could you pass by ? 
Oh ... 
Now my heart is full 
Now my heart is full 
And I just can't explain 
So ... slow ... 
Slow ... slow ... slow ... slow ... slow ...

 

SPRING-HEELED JIM

Spring-heeled Jim winks an eye 
He'll "do", he'll never be "done to" 
He takes on whoever flew through 
"Well, it's the normal thing to do" ... ah ... 
Spring-heeled Jim lives to love 
Now kissing with his mouth full 
And his eyes on some other fool 
So many women 
His head should be spinning 
Ah, but no ! 
Ah, but no ! 
But no !
Ah, no !
Spring-heeled Jim slurs the words : 
"There's no need to be so knowing
Take life at five times the 
Average speed, like I do" 
Until Jim feels the chill 
"Oh, where did all the time go ?" 
Once always in for the kill 
Now it's too cold 
And he feels too 
old 
Too old
Mmm, old... 
La, la, la, la-la, la ...

 

BILLY BUDD

Say, Billy Budd 
So you think you should ? 
Oh, everyone's laughing 
Say, Billy Budd 
So you think that you should ? 
Everyone's laughing ! 
Since I took up with you 
Things have been bad 
Yeah, but now it's 12 years on 
Now it's 12 years on 
Yes, and I took up with you 
I took my job application 
Into town 
Did you hear ? They turned me down 
Yes, and it's all because of us 
Oh, and what was in our eyes 
Oh, what was in our eyes, yeah 
I said, Billy Budd 
I would happily lose 
Both of my legs 
I would lose both of my legs 
Oh, if it meant you could be free 
Oh, if it meant you could be free 
(Don't leave us in the dark!)

 

HOLD ON TO YOUR FRIENDS

A bond of trust 
Has been abused 
Something of value 
May be lost 
Give up your job 
Squander your cash - be rash 
Just hold on to your friends 
There are more than enough 
To fight and oppose 
Why waste good time 
Fighting the people you like 
Who will fall defending your name 
Oh, don't feel so ashamed 
To have friends 
But now you only call me 
When you're feeling depressed 
When you feel happy I'm 
So far from your mind 
My patience is stretched 
My loyalty vexed 
Oh, you're losing all of your friends 
Hold on to your friends 
Hold on to your friends 
Resist - or move on 
Be mad, be rash 
Smoke and explode 
Sell all of your clothes 
Just bear in mind : 
Oh, there just might come a time 
When you need some friends

 

THE MORE YOU IGNORE ME, THE CLOSER I GET

The more you ignore me 
The closer I get 
You're wasting your time 
The more you ignore me 
The closer I get 
You're wasting your time 
I will be 
In the bar 
With my head 
On the bar 
I am now 
A central part 
Of your mind's landscape 
Whether you care 
Or do not 
Yeah, I've made up your mind 
The more you ignore me 
The closer I get 
You're wasting your time 
The more you ignore me 
The closer I get 
You're wasting your time 
Beware !
I bear more grudges 
Than lonely high court judges 
When you sleep 
I will creep 
Into your thoughts 
Like a bad debt 
That you can't pay 
Take the easy way 
And give in 
Yeah, and let me in 
Oh, let me in 
Oh let me ... 
Oh, let me in 
IT'S WAR 
IT'S WAR 
WAR 
WAR 
Oh, let me in 
Ah, the closer I get 
Ah, you're asking for it 
Ah, the closer I get 
Ooh, the closer I ...

 

WHY DON'T YOU FIND OUT FOR YOURSELF

The sanest days are mad 
Why don't you find out for yourself ? 
Then you'll see the price 
Very closely 
Some men here 
They have a special interest 
In your career 
They wanna help you to grow 
And then syphon all your dough 
Why don't you find out for yourself ? 
Then you'll see the glass 
Hidden in the grass 
You'll never believe me, so 
Why don't you find out for yourself ? 
Sick down to my heart 
That's just the way it goes 
Some men here 
They know the full extent of 
Your distress 
They kneel and pray 
And they say : 
"Long may it last" 
Why don't you find out for yourself ?
Then you'll see the glass 
Hidden in the grass 
Bad scenes come and go 
For which you must allow 
Sick down to my heart 
That's just the way it goes 
Don't rake up my mistakes 
I know exactly what they are 
And ... what do YOU do ? 
Well ... you just SIT THERE 
I've been stabbed in the back 
So many many times 
I don't have any skin 
But that's just the way it goes

 

I AM HATED FOR LOVING

I am hated for loving 
I am hated for loving 
Anonymous call, a poison pen 
A brick in the small of the back again 
I still don't belong 
To anyone - I am mine 
And I am hated for loving 
I am haunted for wanting 
Anonymous call, a poison pen 
A brick in the ... ah ... 
A brick in the small of the back again 
I still don't belong 
To anyone - I am mine 
I am falling 
With no-one to catch me 
I am falling 
And there's still 
No-one to catch me 
Ah .. 
Anonymous call, a poison pen 
A brick in the ... ah ... 
A brick in the small of the back again 
I just don't belong 
To anywhere 
I just don't belong 
Mmm ... 
Ah ...

 

LIFEGUARD SLEEPING, GIRL DROWNING

Always looking for attention 
Always needs to be mentioned 
Who does she 
Think she should be ? 
The shrill cry through darkening air 
Doesn't she know he's 
Had such a busy day ? 
Tell her ... sshhh
Somebody tell her ... sshhh 
Slowest ... 
It was only a test 
But she swam too far 
Against the tide 
She deserves all she gets 
The sky became marked with stars 
As an out-stretched arm slowly 
Disappears 
Hooray 
Oh hooray 
No, oh, oh, woh, there's no movement 
No, oh, hooray 
Oh, hooray 
Please don't worry 
There'll be no fuss 
She was ... nobody's nothing 
(What's your name ?) 
When he awoke 
The sea was calm 
And another day passes like a dream 
There's no ... no way 
(What's your name ?)

 

USED TO BE A SWEET BOY

Used to be a sweet boy 
Holding so tightly 
To Daddy's hand 
But that was all 
In some distant land 
Blazer and tie 
And a big bright healthy smile 
Used to make all 
Of our trials worthwhile 
Used to be a sweet boy 
And I'm not to blame 
Something went wrong 
And I know 
I'm not to blame 
Something went wrong 
Can't be to blame 
Ah ...

 

THE LAZY SUNBATHERS

A world war 
Was announced 
Days ago 
But they didn't know 
The lazy sunbathers 
The lazy sunbathers 
The sun burns through 
To the planet's core 
And it isn't enough 
They want more 
Nothing 
Appears 
To be 
Between the ears of 
The lazy sunbathers 
Too jaded 
To question stagnation 
The sun burns through 
To the planet's core 
And it isn't enough 
They want more 
Religions fall 
Children shelled 
"...Children shelled ? That's all 
Very well, but would you 
Please keep the noise 
Down low ? 
Because you're waking 
The lazy sunbathers ..."
Oh, the lazy sunbathers 
The lazy sunbathers

 

SPEEDWAY

And when you slam 
Down the hammer 
Can you see it in your heart ? 
All of the rumours 
Keeping me grounded 
I never said, I never said that they were 
Completely unfounded 
So when you slam 
Down the hammer 
Can you see it in your heart ? 
Can you delve so low ? 
And when you're standing 
On my fingers 
Can you see it in your heart ? ... ah ... 
And when you try 
To break my spirit 
It won't work 
Because there's nothing left to break 
Anymore 
All of the rumours 
Keeping me grounded 
I never said, I never said that they were 
Completely unfounded 
You won't sleep 
Until the earth that wants me 
Finally has me 
Oh you've done it now 
You won't rest 
Until the hearse that becomes me 
Finally takes me 
Oh you've done it now 
And you won't smile 
Until my loving mouth 
Is shut good and proper 
FOREVER 
All of the rumours 
Keeping me grounded 
I never said, I never said that they were 
Completely unfounded 
And all those lies 
Written lies, twisted lies 
Well, they weren't lies 
They weren't lies 
They weren't lies 
I never said 
I never said 
I could have mentioned your name 
I could have dragged you in 
Guilt by implication 
By association 
I've always been true to you 
In my own strange way 
I've always been true to you 
In my own sick way 
I'll always stay true to you

 

THE TEACHERS ARE AFRAID OF THE PUPILS

There's too many people 
Planning your downfall 
When your spirit's on trial 
These nights can be frightening 
Sleep transports sadness 
To some other mid-brain 
And somebody here 
Will not be here next year 
So you stand by the board 
Full of fear and intention 
And, if you think that they're listening 
Well, you've got to be joking 
Oh, you understand change 
And you think it's essential 
But when your profession 
Is humiliation 
Say the wrong word to our children ...
We'll have you, oh yes, we'll have you 
Lay a hand on our children 
And it's never too late to have you 
Mucus on your collar 
A nail up through the staff chair 
A blade in your soap 
And you cry into your pillow 
To be finished would be a relief 
To be finished would be a relief... 
Say the wrong word to our children ...
We'll have you, oh yes, we'll have you 
Lay a hand on our children 
And it's never too late to have you 
To be finished would be a relief 
To be finished would be a relief...
I'm very glad this thing has come 
Sometimes I'm so glad 
Never bother to play the tunes 
I've seen it coming for dear life

 

READER MEET AUTHOR

You don't know a thing about their lives 
They live where you wouldn't dare to drive
You shake as you think of how they sleep 
But you write as if you are my side-by-side 
Reader, meet Author 
With the hope of hearing sense 
But you may be feeling let down 
By the words of defence 
He says : "No-one ever sees me when I cry"
You don't know a thing about their lives 
Books don't save them, books aren't Stanley knives 
And if a fight broke out here tonight 
You'd be the first away, because you're that type 
And the Year 2000 won't change anyone here 
As each fabled promise flies so fast 
You'll swear it was never there 
Oh, have you ever escaped from a shipwrecked life ? 
So safely with your software; all miles from the front line 
You hear the way their sad voices, and you start to imagine things 
Oh, any excuse to write more lies

 

THE BOY RACER

He's just too good-natured and 
He's got too much money and

And I'm gonna ... kill him !
Oh, no ! Oh, no ! Oh, no ! Oh, no ! Oh, no !Oh .... 
Boy racer Boy racer, oh

THE OPERATION

You fight with your right hand 
And caress with your left hand 
Everyone I know is sick to death of you 
With a tear that's a mile wide 
In the kite that you're flying 
Everyone I know is sick to death of you 
Ever since 
You don't look the same 
You're just not the same, no way 
You say clever things and 
You never used to 
You don't catch what I'm saying 
When you're deafened to advice 
Everyone here is sick to the 
Back teeth of you 
With a tear that's a mile wide 
In the kite that you're flying 
Everyone here is sick to the 
Tattoo of you 
Ever since 
You don't look the same 
You're just not the same, no way 
You say pleasant things and 
There is no need to
Still, you fight with your right hand 
And caress with your left hand 
Ooh, ooh ... Sad to say ... 
How once I was in love with you 
Sad to say ... 
You don't catch what I'm saying 
When you're deafened to advice 
Ooh, ooh ... Ever since 
You don't look the same 
You're just not the same, no way 
What the hell have 
They stuck into you ?

 

DAGENHAM DAVE

Head in the clouds, and a mouthful of pie 
Head in a blouse, everybody loves him 
I see why 
Dagenham Dave, Dagenham Dave, Oh, Dagenham Dave 
Dagenham Dave, Dagenham Dave, Oh, Dagenham Dave 
"I love Karen, I love Sharon" on the windowscreen 
With never the need to fight or to question a single thing 
Dagenham Dave, Dagenham Dave Oh, Dagenham Dave 
Dagenham Dave, Dagenham Dave Oh, Dagenham Dave ...
He'd love to touch, he's afraid that he might self-combust 
I could say more, but you get the general idea 
Dagenham Dave, Dagenham Dave Dagenham Dave, Dagenham Dave 
Dagenham, Dagenham Dagenham Dave, Dagenham Dave ...
Oh, Dave, oh, Dagenham, dagenham, Oh, Dave, oh, Dave, ...

 

DO YOUR BEST AND DON'T WORRY

Compare the best of their days 
With the worst of your days 
You won't win 
With your standards so high 
And your spirits so low 
At least remember ... 
This is you on a bad day, you on a pale day 
Just do your best and don't ... Don't worry, oh 
The way you hang yourself is oh, so unfair 
See the best of how they look 
Against the worst of how you are
And again, you won't win 
With your standards so high 
And your spirits so low 
At least remember ... 
This is you on a drab day, you in a drab dress 
Just do your best and don't ... Don't worry, oh 
The way you hang yourself is oh, so unfair 
Just do your best and don't ... Don't worry, oh 
The way you watch yourself is oh, so unfair 
Just do your best and don't ... Don't worry, oh 
Do your best and don't ...

SOUTHPAW

You were a boy before you became a man 
I don't see the joy 
And you ran with your pals in the sun 
You turned around and they were gone 
Again ... 
A sick boy should be treated 
So easily defeated 
Oh, I just don't understand 
So you ran with your pals in the sun 
You turned around 
You were alone 
Again ... 
And you ran back to Ma 
Which set the pace for the rest of your days 
Oh, you ran back to Ma 
Which set the pace for the rest of your days 
Oh, you ran back to Ma 
Which set the pace for the rest of your days 
And now, there is something that you should know 
There is something that you should know 
The girl of your dreams is 
Here all alone 
Girl of your dreams is 
Here all alone 
The girl of your dreams is 
Sad and all alone

Sad and is feeling all alone 
Oh, there is something that you should know 
Help me, help me, help me ...

 

MALADJUSTED

I wanna start from 
Before the beginning 
Loot wine, "Be mine, and 
Then let's stay out for the night"
Ride via Parkside 
Semi-perilous lives 
Jeer the lights in the windows 
Of all safe and stable homes 
(But wondering then, well what 
Could peace of mind be like ?)
Anyway do you want to hear 
Our story, or not ? 
As the Fulham Road lights 
Stretch and invite into the night 
From a Stevenage overspill 
We'd kill to live around 
SW6 - with someone like you 
Keep thieves' hours 
With someone like you 
...As long as it slides 
You stalk the house 
In a low-cut blouse : 
"Oh Christ, another stifled 
Friday night !"
And the Fulham Road lights 
Stretch and invite into the night 
Well, I was fifteen 
What could I know ?
When the gulf between 
All the things I need 
And the things I receive 
Is an ancient ocean 
Wide, wild, lost, uncrossed 
Still I maintain there's nothing 
Wrong with you 
You do all that you do 
Because it's all you can do 
Well, I was fifteen 
Where could I go ?
With a soul full of loathing 
For stinging bureaucracy 
Making it anything 
Other than easy 
For working girls like me 
With my hands on my head 
I flop on your bed 
With a head full of dread 
For all I've ever said 
Maladjusted, maladjusted 
Maladjusted maladjusted 
Never to be trusted 
Oh, never to be trusted 
There's nothing wrong with you, oh 
...There's nothing wrong with you

 

ALMA MATTERS

So : the choice I have made 
May seem strange to you 
But who asked you, anyway ? 
It's my life to wreck 
My own way 
You see : to someone, somewhere, oh yeah ... 
Alma matters 
In mind, body and soul 
In part, and in whole 
Because to someone, somewhere, oh yeah ... 
Alma matters 
In mind, body and soul 
In part, and in whole 
So the life I have made 
May seem wrong to you 
But, I've never been surer 
It's my life to ruin 
My own way 
You see : to someone, somewhere, oh yeah ... 
Alma matters 
In mind, body and soul 
In part, and in whole 
Because to someone, somewhere, oh yeah ... 
Alma matters 
In mind, body and soul 
In part, and in whole 
To someone, somewhere, oh yeah ... 
Alma matters 
In mind, body and soul 
Part, and in whole 
So to someone, somewhere, oh yeah ... 
Alma matters 
In mind, body and soul 
Part, and in whole 
To someone, somewhere, oh yeah ... 
Oh yeah ... Oh yeah, oh yeah Oh yeah ...

 

AMBITIOUS OUTSIDERS

Bolt-lock your doors 
Alarm your cars 
And still we move in closer 
Every day 
Top of the list 
Is your smiling kids 
But we'll be smiling too 
So that's OK 
Oh, and by the way 
Thank you, because you're 
Giving, giving, giving 
And we're receiving - 
No, no, we're taking 
Keeping the population down 
Your taxes paid, but 
Police waylaid 
And we knows 
When the school bus 
Comes and goes 
We're on your street, but 
You don't see us 
Or, if you do 
You smile and say Hello 
BUT DON'T UNDERESTIMATE US 
When you are 
Giving, giving, giving 
And we're receiving - 
No, no, we're taking 
Just keeping 
The population down 
You're giving, giving, giving 
Well, it's your own fault 
For reproducing 
We're just keeping 
The population down

 

TROUBLE LOVES ME

Trouble loves me 
Trouble needs me 
Two things 
More than you do 
Or would attempt to 
So, console me 
Otherwise, hold me 
Just when it seems like 
Everything's evened out 
And the balance 
Seems serene 
Trouble loves me 
Walks beside me 
To chide me 
Not to guide me 
It's still much more 
Than you'll do 
So, console me 
Otherwise, hold me 
Just when it seems like 
Everything's evened out 
And the balance seems serene 
See the fool I'll be 
Still running 'round 
On the flesh rampage 
Still running 'round 
Ready with ready-wit 
Still running 'round 
On the flesh rampage 
- At your age ! 
Go to Soho, oh 
Go to waste in 
The wrong arms 
Still running 'round 
Trouble loves me 
Seeks and finds me 
To charlatanize me 
Which is only 
As it should be 
Oh, please fulfill me 
Otherwise, kill me 
Show me a barrel and watch me scrape it 
Faced with the music, as always I'll face it 
In the half-light 
So English, frowning 
Then at midnight I 
Can't get you out of my head 
A disenchanted taste 
Still running 'round 
A disenchanted taste 
Still running 'round

 

PAPA JACK

Papa Jack 
Wants to turn 
Back the clock 
And reach out 
To the kids 
He once had 
Who have flown 
Papa Jack 
In decline 
Feels inclined 
To reach out 
To the kids 
He once had 
Who have flown 
But there was a time 
When the kids reached up 
And Papa Jack just 
Pushed them away 
Looking deep 
In his heart 
Papa Jack 
Doesn't like 
What he sees 
Or the time 
On his hands 
The dying day 
The chilly sun 
Papa Jack 
All alone 
Sings slow 
Grieving and low 
But there was a time 
When the kids reached up 
Now you can't always 
Have it your way 
Papa Jack 
Ah ...

 

AMMUNITION

I know these roads 
Each ridge 
And narrow bridge 
Each cheveron 
Enticing me on 
Each warning sign 
I take in my stride 
I don't need more ammunition 
I've got more than I can spend 
I don't dwell on things I'm missing 
I'm just pleased 
With the things I've found 
I know these roads 
An old hand understands 
Above all, I know what's 
Expected of me now 
Veering cliffwards 
I don't need more ammunition 
I've got more than I can spend 
I don't dwell on things I'm missing 
I'm just pleased 
With the things I've found 
With the things I've found 
With the things I've found 
I've found 
I've been crying 
It comes back on these salient days 
And it stays 
And it says : 
"We've never really been away" 
I don't need more ammunition 
I've got more than I can spend 
I don't think of who I'm missing 
I've got no space and no time 
In my life, anymore 
No space or time 
In my life, anymore 
For Revenge

 

WIDE TO RECEIVE

Download something 
Useful, or useless 
Because I'm lying here 
Wide to receive 
Almost anything 
You'd care to give 
And I don't 
Get along with myself 
And I'm not too keen 
On anyone else 
Turn on, plug in 
Then just walk away 
Unlock, process 
And then just go 
And I've never felt quite so alone 
As I do right now 
I'm lying here 
Wide to receive 
Almost anything 
You'd care to leave 
Wide, wide, wide Wide, wide, wide...

 

ROY'S KEEN

(GO ON !)
He's romancing you 
And chancing his arm 
He'll be here 
Smiling on time 
He's romancing you 
And chancing his arm 
He'll be here 
Smiling on time 
Roy's keen oh Roy's keen 
Roy's keen oh Roy's keen 
We've never seen a 
Keener window-cleaner 
Back up the ladder 
Into each corner 
Dunking the chamois 
Just think of the goodwill 
The ladder's a planet 
Roy is a star, and 
I am a satellite 
(But that's alright) 
He can hold a smile for as long 
As you require (even longer) 
He can hold a smile for as long 
As you require (even longer) 
Roy's keen oh Roy's keen 
Roy's keen oh Roy's keen 
We've never seen a 
Keener window-cleaner 
Back up the ladder 
Into each corner 
Dunking the chamois 
Just think of the goodwill 
The ladder's a planet 
Roy is a star, and 
I am a satellite 
I will be set alight 
Don't say you'll hold it steady 
Then you let it go 
Don't say you'll hold it steady 
Then you let it go Oh ...
You're up the ladder 
Into each corner 
Foot in a bucket 
We trust you to wreck it 
Even when it's under your nose 
Well, you just can't 
See it, can you ? 
Well, it's here 
Right under your nose 
And you just can't 
See it, can you? La la la la ...
Roy's keen, Roy's keen La la la la ...
We've never seen a 
Keener window-cleaner 
Oh ... La la la la ...

 

HE CRIED

I need you 
Simple words 
But words which had never been heard 
By the soul 
Stoned to death 
But still living 
And so he froze where he stood 
And he looked to the ground 
And he cried 
He cried 
Ride our minds 
If you must 
But there's always a line you don't cross 
Time is short 
Don't be cruel 
Oh you don't know the power 
In what you're saying 
Oh ... 
And so he froze where he stood 
And he looked to the ground 
And he cried 
He cried 
People where 
I come from 
They survive without feelings or blood 
I never could 
Was stoned to death 
But I'm still living 
So he froze where he stood 
And he looked to the ground 
And he cried 
He cried 
So he froze 
And he looked, and he looked 
To the ground 
And he cried 
He cried

 

SORROW WILL COME IN THE END

Legalized theft 
Leaves me bereft 
I get it straight in the neck 
(Somehow expecting no less) 
A court of justice 
With no use for Truth 
Lawyer ...liar 
Lawyer ...liar 
You pleaded and squealed 
And you think you've won 
But Sorrow will come 
To you in the end 
And as sure as my words are pure 
I praise the day that brings you pain 
Q.C.'s obsessed with sleaze 
Frantic for Fame 
They're all on the game 
They just use a different name 
You lied 
And you were believed 
By a J.P. senile and vile 
You pleaded and squealed 
And you think you've won 
But Sorrow will come 
To you in the end 
And as sure as my words are pure 
I praise the day that brings you pain 
So don't close your eyes 
Don't close your eyes 
A man who slits throats 
Has time on his hands 
And I'm gonna get you 
So don't close your eyes 
Don't ever close your eyes 
You think you've won 
OH NO

 

SATAN REJECTED MY SOUL

Satan rejected my soul 
He knows my kind 
He won't be dragged down 
He's seen my face around 
He knows Heaven doesn't seem 
To be my home 
So I must find 
Somewhere else to go 
So I must find 
Somewhere else to go 
So, take it - please 
It's free 
You'll never see 
You'll never see 
All the fun in life it's cost me 
Satan rejected my soul 
As low as he goes 
He never quite goes this low 
He's seen my face around 
He knows Heaven doesn't seem 
To be my home 
So I must find 
Somewhere else to go 
So I must find 
Somewhere else to go 
So, take it please 
It's really sly 
Come on, come on, ah Come on, come on, come on 
Take it please, It's really sly 
Come on, come on, ah Come on, come on, come on 
Call me in, Pull me in, call me in 
Come on, come on, oh Come on, come on, come on 
Pull me in, pull me in, Call me in, haul me in, pull me in 
Come on, come on, ah, Come on, come on 
La la la la la, Oh ...

 
 REEL AROUND THE FOUNTAIN

It's time the tale was told
of how you took a child
and you made him old
Reel around the fountain
slap me on the patio
I'll take it now
Fifteen minutes with you
well, I wouldn't say no
people said that you were virtually dead
and they were so wrong
fifteen minutes with you
well, i wouldn't say no
people said that you were easily led
and they were half-right
I dreamt about you last night
and i fell out of bed twice
you can pin and mount me like a butterfly
but take me to the haven of your bed
was something that you never said
two lumps, please
you're the bee's knees
but so am I
Meet me at the fountain
shove me on the patio
I'll take it slowly
Fifteen minutes with you
oh I wouldn't say no
people see no worth in you
oh but I do

 

YOU'VE GOT EVERYTHING NOW

As merry as the days were long
I was right and you were wrong
back at the old grey school
I would win and you would lose
But you've got everything now
and what a terrible mess I've made of my life
No, I've never had a job
because I've never wanted one
I've seen you smile
but I've never really heard you laugh
So who is rich and who is poor?
I cannot say...
You are your mother's only son
and you're a desperate one
But I don't want a lover
I just want to be seen in the back of your car
A friendship sadly lost?
Well, this is true ...and yet, it's false
Did I ever tell you , by the way
I never did like your face
But you've got everything now
and what a terrible mess I've made of my life
No, I've never had a job
because I'm too shy
But I don't want a lover
I just want to be tied to the back of your car.

 

MISERABLE LIE

So, goodbye
please stay with your own kind
and I'll stay with mine
There's something against us
it's not time
So, goodbye
I know I hardly say
how much I love your casual way
but please put your tongue away
a little higher and we're well away
the dark nights are drawing in
and your humour is as black as them
I look at yours, you laugh at mine
and"love" is just a miserable lie
you have destroyed my flower like-life
not once-but twice
you have corrupt my innocent mind
not once-but twice
I know that wind-swept mystical air
it means: I'd like to see your underwear
I recognise that mystical air
it means: I'd like to see your underwear
what do we get for the trouble and pain?
just a rented room in Whalley Range
into the depths of the criminal world
I followed her...
I need advice, I need advice
because nobody ever looks at me twice
I'm just a country-mile behind
the world
I'm just a country mile behind
the whole world
so take me when you go

 

PRETTY GIRLS MAKE GRAVES

Upon the sand,upon the bay
"there is a quick and easy way" you say
before you illustrate
I'd rather state:
"I'm not the man you think I am
I'm not the man you think I am "
And Sorrow's native son
he will not smile for anyone
And pretty girls makes the graves
End of the pier, end of the bay
you tug my arm and say:"Give into lust,
give up to lust, oh heaven knows we'll
soon be dust..."
But I'm not the man you think I am
I'm not the man you think I am
And Sorrow's native son
he will not rise for anyone
And pretty girls make graves
I could have been wild and I could have been free
but Nature played this trick on me
She wants it Now
and she will not wait
but she's too rough
and I'm too delicate
Then on the sand
another man, he takes her hand
and a smile lights up her stupid face
(and well, it would)
I lost my faith in Womanhood
I lost my faith in Womanhood, I lost my faith

 

THE HAND THAT ROCKS THE CRADLE

Please don't cry
the ghost and the storm outside
will not invade this sacred shire
nor infiltrate your mind
my life down I shall lie
if the bogey-man should try
to play tricks on your sacred mind
to tease, torment and tantalise
wavering shadows loom
a piano plays in an empty room
there'll be blood on the cleaver tonight
when darkness lifts and the room is bright
I'll still be by your side
for you are all that matters
and I'll love you till the day I die
there never need to be longing in your eyes
as long as the hand that rocks the cradle is mine
ceiling shadows shimmy by
and when the wardrobe towers like a beast of prey
there's a sadness in your beautiful eyes
you're untouched, unsoiled, wonderous eyes
my life down I shall lie
should restless spirts try
to play tricks on you sacred mind
but whom I never gave a name
I just looked into his wonderous eyes
and said" never never never again"
all too soon I did return
just like a moth to a flame
so rattle my bones all over the stones
because I'm only a beggar-man whom nobody owns
see how words as old as sin
fit me like a glove I'm here and here I'll stay
together we lie, together we pray
there never need be longing in your eyes
as long as the hand that rocks the cradle is mine

 

STILL ILL

I decree today that life
is simply taking and not giving
England is mine and it owes me a living
ask me why, and I'll spit in your eye
ask me why, and I'll spit in your eye
but we cannot cling to the old dreams anymore
no, we cannot cling to the old dreams anymore
Does the body rule the mind
or does the mind rule the body?
I dunno...
Under the iron bridge we kissed
and although I ended up with sore lips
it just wasn't like the old days anymore
no, it wasn't like those days
am I still ill?
Does the body rule the mind
or does the mind rule the body ?
I dunno...
Ask me why, and I'll die
ask me why, and I'll die
and if you must go to work tomorrow
well, if I were you I wouldn't bother
for there are brighter sides to life
and I should know because I've seen them
but not very often...
under the iron bridge we kissed
and although I ended up with sore lips
it just wasn't like the old days anymore
no, it wasn't like those days
am I still ill?

 

HAND IN GLOVE

Hand in glove
the sun shines out of our behinds
no, it's not like any other love
this one is different-because it's us
Hand in glove
we can go wherever we please
and everything depends upon
how near you stand to me
And if the people stare
then the people stare
I really don't know and I really don't care
Hand in glove
the Good People laugh
yes, we may be hidden by rags
but we have something they'll never have
So, hand in glove I stake my claim
I'll fight to the last breath
If they dare touch a hair on your head
I'll fight to the last breath
The Good Life is out there, somewhere
so stay on my arm, you little charmer
But I know my luck too well
and I'll probably never see you again.

 

WHAT DIFFERENCE DOES IT MAKE?

All men have secrets and here is mine
so let it be known
we have been through hell and high tide,
I can surely rely on you?
and yet you start to recoil,
heavy words are so lightly thrown
but still I'd leap in front of a flying bullet for you
So, what difference does it make?
so, what difference does it make?
it makes none
but you have gone
and you must be looking very old tonight
The devil will find work for idle hands to do
I stole and I lied, and why?
because you asked me to!
but now you make feel so ashamed
because I've only got two hands
well, I'm still fond of you
So, what difference does it make?
so, what difference does it make?
it makes none
but you have gone
and your prejudice won't keep you warm tonight
So, no more apologies
no more apologies
I'm too tired
I'm too sick and tired
and I'm feeling very sick and ill today
But I'm still fond of you

 

I DON'T OWE YOU ANYTHING

Bought on stolen wine
a nod was the first step
you know very well
what was coming next
did I really walk all this way
just to hear you say
"oh I don't want to go out tonight"
but you will
for you must
I don't owe you anything
but you owe me something
repay me now
you should never go to them
let them come to you
just like I do
you should not go to them
let them come to you
just like I do
Too freely on your lips
words prematurely said
oh but I know what will make you smile tonight
Life is never kind
life is never kind
oh but I know what will make you smile tonight

 

SUFFER LITTLE CHILDREN

Over the moors,take me to the moors
dig a shallow grave
and I'll lay me down
Lesley-Anne, with your pretty white beads
oh John, you'll never be a man
and you'll never see your home again
oh Manchester, so much to answer for
Edward, see those alluring lights?
tonight will be your very last night
a woman said "I know my son is dead
I'll never rest my hands on his scared head"
Hindley wakes and Hindley says:
"Wherever he has gone, I have gone "
But fresh lilaced moorland fields
cannot hide the stoild stench of death
Hindley wakes and Hindley says:
"Whatever he has done, I have done"
But this is no easy ride
for a child cries
"find me...find me, nothing more
we're on a sullen misty moor
we may be dead and we may be gone
but we will be right by your side
until the day you die
this is no easy ride
we will haunt you when you laugh
yes, you could say we're a team
you might sleep
BUT YOU WILL NEVER DREAM!"
Oh Manchester, so much to answer for
Oh Manchester, so much to answer for
Over the moor, I'm on the moor
the child is on the moor

 

THE HEADMASTER RITUAL

Belligerent ghouls
run Manchester schools
spineless swines
cemented mines
Sir leads the troops
jealous of youth
same old suit since 1962
he does the military two-step
down the nape of my neck
I wanna go home
I don't want to stay
give up education
is a bad mistake
mid-week on the playing fields
Sir thwacks you on the knees
knees you in the groin
elbow in the face
I wanna go home
I don't want to stay
Belligerent ghouls
run Manchester schools
spineless bastards all
Sir leads the troops
jealous of youth
same old jokes since 1902
he does the military two-step
down the nape of my neck
I wanna go home
I don't want to stay
give up life
as a bad mistake
please excuse me from gym
I've got this terrible cold coming on
he grabs and devours
he kicks me in the showers
kicks me in the showers
and he grabs and devours
I wanna go home
I don't want to stay

 

RUSHOLME RUFFIANS

The last night at the fair
by the big wheel generator
a boy is stabbed
and his money is grabbed
and the air hangs heavy like a dulling wine
she is famous
she is funny
an engagement ring
doesn't mean a thing
to a mind consumed by brass(money)
and though I walk home alone
my faith in love is still devout
the last night at the fair
from a seat on a whirling waltzer
her skirt ascends for a watching eye
it's a hideous trait( on her mother's side)
and though I walk home alone
my faith in love is still devout
then someone falls in love
and someone's beaten up
and the senses being dulled are mine
and someone falls in love
someone's beaten up
and the senses being dulled are mine
and though I walk home alone
my faith in love is still devout
this is the last night of the fair
and the grease in the hair
of a speedway operator
is all a tremulous heart requires
a schoolgirl is denied
she said "How quickly would I die
if I jumped from the top of the parachutes?"
this is the last night of the fair
and the grease in the hair
of a speedway operator

scratch my name on your arm with a fountain pen
(this means you really love me)

I WANT THE ONE I CAN'T HAVE

On the day that your mentality
catches up with your biology
I want the one I can't have
and it's driving me mad
it's written all over my face
A double-bed
and a stalwart lover, for sure
these are the riches of the poor
A double-bed
and a stalwart lover, for sure
these are the riches of the poor
a tough kid who sometimes swallows nails
raised on Prisoner's Aid
he killed a policeman when he was thirteen
and somehow that really impressed me
it's written all over my face
On the day that your mentality
catches up with your biology
And if you ever need self-validation
just meet me in the alley by the
railway-station
it's written all over my face

 

WHAT SHE SAID

What she said:
"How come someone hasn't noticed
that I'm dead
and decided to bury me
God knows, I'm ready"
What she said was
but then, all the rejection she's had
to pretend to be happy
could only be idiocy
What she said was not for the job or
lover that she never had
What she read
all heady books
she'd sit and prophesise
(it took a tattoed boy from Birkenhead
to really really open her eyes)

THAT JOKE ISN'T FUNNY ANYMORE

Park the car at the side of the road
you should know
time's tide will smother you
and I will too
when you laugh about other people who feel so
very lonely
their only desire is to die
well I'm afraid
it doesn't make me smile
I wish I could laugh
but that joke isn't funny anymore
it's too close to home and it's too near the bone
it's too close to home and it's too near the bone
more than you'll ever know
It was dark as I drove the point home
and on cold leather seats
well, it suddenly struck me
I just might die with a smile on my
face after all
I've seen this happen in other people's lives
and now it's happening in mine

 

NOWHERE FAST

I'd like to drop my trousers to the world
I am a man of means(of slender means)
each household appliance
is like a new science in my town
and if a day came when I felt a natural emotion
I'd get such a shock I'd probably jump in the ocean
and when a train goes by
it's such a sad sound
I'd like to drop my trousers to the Queen
every sensible child will know what this means
the poor and the needy
are selfish and greedy on her terms
and if the day came when I felt a natural emotion
I'd get such a shock I'd probably jump in the ocean
and when a train goes by
it's such a sad song
And when I'm lying in my bed
I think about life
and I think about death
and neither one particularly appeals to me
and if the day came when I felt a natural emotion
I'd get such a shock I'd probably lie
in the middle of the street and die
I'd lie down and die

 

WELL I WONDER

Well I wonder
do you hear me when you sleep?
I hoarsely cry
Well I wonder
do you see me when we pass?
I half-die
Please keep me in mind
please keep me in mind
Gasping-but somehow still alive
this is the fierce last stand of all I am
Gasping-dying-but somehow still alive
this is the final stand of all I am
Please keep me in mind

 

BARBARISM BEGINS AT HOME

Unruly boys
who will not grow up
must be taken in hand
Unruly girls
who will not settle down
they must be taken in hand
A crack on the head
is what you get for not asking
and a crack on the head
is what you get for asking

 

MEAT IS MURDER

Heifer whines could be human cries
closer comes the screaming knife
this beautiful creature must die
this beautiful creature must die
a death for no reason
and death for reason is MURDER
and the flesh you so fancifully fry
is not succulent, tasty or nice
it's death for no reason
and death for no reason is MURDER
and the calf that you carve with a smile
is MURDER
and the turkey you festively slice
is MURDER
do you know how animals die?
kitchen aroma aren't very homely
it's not "comforting," "cheery" or kind
it's sizzling blood and the unholy stench
of MURDER
it's not "natural," "normal" or kind
the fleas you so fancifully fry
as you savour the flavour
of MURDER
NO, NO, NO, IT'S MURDER
NO, NO, NO, IT'S MURDER
who hears when animals cry?

 

THE QUEEN IS DEAD

Farewell to this lands cheerless marches
hemmed in like a boar between arches
her very Lowness with her head in a sling
Im truely sorry-but it sounds like a wonderful thing
dear Charles, dont you ever crave
to appear on the front of the Daily mail
dressed in your Mother's bridal veil?
So, I checked all the registered historical facts
and I was shocked into shame to discover
how Im the 18th pale descendent
of some, old queen or other
has the world changed, or have I changed?
has the world changed, or have I changed?
as some 9-year old tough peddles drugs
(I never even knew what drugs were)
And so, I broke into the Palace
with a sponge and a rusty spanner
she said: "Eh, I know you, and you cannot sing"
I said: "that's nothing -you should hear me play piano"
We can go for a walk where it's quiet and dry
and we can talk about precious things
but when you are tied to your mother's apron
not one talks about castration
We can go for a walk where it's quiet and dry
and we can talk about precious things
like love and law and poverty
these are the things that kill me
We can go for a walk where it's quiet and dry
and we can talk about precious things
but the rain that flattens my hair
theses are the things that kill me
Passed the Pub that saps your body
and the church who'll snatch your money
the Queen is dead, boys
and it's so lonely on a limb
Pass the Pub that wrecks your body
and the church-all they want is your money
the Queen is dead, boys`
you can trust me, boys
life is very long, when you're lonely
life is very long, when you're lonely...

 

FRANKLY MR.SHANKLY

Frankly, Mr Shankly, this position Ive held
it pays my way, but it corrodes my soul
I want to leave you will not miss me
I want to go down in musical history
Frankly, Mr Shankly, Im a sickening wreck
Ive got the 21st Century breathing down my neck
I must move fast, you understand me
I want to go down in celluloid history
Fame, Fame, fatal Fame
it can play hideous tricks on the brain
but still I rather be Famous
than righteous or holy, any day
but sometimes Id feel more fulfilled
making Christmas cards with the mentally ill
I want to Live and I want to Love
I want to catch something that I might be ashamed of
Frankly, Mr Shankly, this position I've held
it pays my way and it corrodes my soul
oh, I didnt realise that you wrote poetry
(I didnt realise you wrote such bloody awful poetry)
Frankly, Mr Shankly, since you ask
you are a flatulent pain the arse
I do not mean to be so rude
but still, I must speck frankly, Mr Shankly

 

I KNOW IT'S ALL OVER

Oh Mother, I can fell the soil falling over my head
and as i climb into an empty bed
Oh well, Enough said
I know it's over-still I cling
I don't know where else I can go
Oh Mother, I can feel the soil falling over my head
see, the sea want s to take me
the knife wants to cut me
do you think you can help me?
Sad veiled bride, please be happy
handsome groom, give her room
loud, loutish lover, treat her kindly
(although she needs you
more than she loves you)
and I know it's over
and it never really began
but in my heart it was so real
and you even spoke to me and said:
"If you're so funny
then why are you on your own tonight?
and if you are so clever
then why are you on your own tonight?
if you're so terribly good looking
then why do you sleep alone tonight?
because tonight is just like any other night
that's why you're on your own tonight
with your triumphs and your charms
while they are in each other's arms.."
It's so easy to laugh
it's so easy to hate
it takes strength to be gentle and kind
It's so easy to laugh
it's so easy to hate
it takes guts to be gentle and kind
love is Natural and Real
but not for you, my love
not tonight my love
love is Natural and Real
but not for such as you and I, my love
Oh Mother, I can fell the soil falling over my head
Oh Mother, I can fell the soil falling over my head...

 

NEVER HAD NO ONE EVER

When you walk without ease
on these
the very streets where you were raised
I had a really bad dream
it lasted 20 years, 7 months, and 27 days
Never had no one ever.

 

CEMETERY GATES

A dreaded sunny day
so I meet you at the cemetry gates
Keats and Yeats are on your side
A dreaded sunny day
so I meet you at the cemetry gates
Keats and Yeats are on your side
while Wilde is on mine
So we go inside and we gravely read the stones
all those people all those lives
where are they now ?
with loves, and hates
and passions just like mine
they were born
and then they lived and then they died
which seems so unfair
and I wantr to crv
You say: "ere thrice the sun hath done salutation to the dawn"
and you claim these words as your own
but Im well-read, have heard them said
a hundred times (maybe less, maybe more)
if you must write prose/poems
the words you use should be your own
dont plagiarise or take "on loans"
there's alweays someone, somewhere
with a big nose, who knows
and who trips you up and laughs
when you fall
You say: "ere long done do does did "
words which could only be your own
you then produce the text
from whence was ripped
(some dizzy whore, 1804)
A dreaded sunny day
so let's go where we're happy
so I meet you at the cemetry gates
Keats and Yeats are on your side
A dreaded sunny day
so let's go where we're wanted
so I meet you at the cemetry gates
Keats and Yeats are on your side
but you lose
because Wilde is on mine

 

BIGMOUTH STRIKES AGAIN

Sweetness, sweetness I was only joking
when I said Id like to smash every tooth
in your head
Sweetness, sweetness I was only joking
when I said by right s you should be
bludgeoned in your bed
and now I know how Joan of Arc felt
now I know how Joan of Arc felt
as the flames roseto her roman nose
and her Walkman stared to melt
Bibmouth, bigmouth
bigmouth strikes again
and Ive got no right to take my place
with the Human race
and now I know how Joan of Arc felt
now I know of Joan of Arc felt
as the flames rose to her roman nose
and her hearing aid started to melt
Bigmouth, bigmouth
bigmouth strikes again
and Ive got no right to take my place
with the Human race

 

THE BOY WITH A THORN IN HIS SIDE

The boy with the thorn in his side
behind the hatred there lies
a murderous desire for love
how can they look into my eyes
and still they dont believe me
how can they hear me say those words
and still they dont believe me
and if they don't believe me now
will they ever believe me?
and if they don't believe me now
will they ever believe me?
The boy with the thorn in his side
behind the hatred there lies
a plundering desire for love
how can they see the Love in our eyes
and still they don't believe us
and after all this time
they don't want to believe us
and if they dont believe us now
will they ever believe us ?
andd when you want to Live
how do you start ?
where do you go ?
who do you know?

 

VICAR IN A TUTU

I was minding mind business
lifting some lead off
the roof of the Holy Name church
it was worthwhile living a laughable life
just to set my eyes on a blistering sight
of a vicar in a tu-tu
he's not strange
he just wants to live his life this way
a scanty bit of a thing
with a decorative ring
that wouldn't cover the head of a child
as Rose collects the money in the cannister
who comes sliding down the bannister
the vicar in a tu-tu
he's not strange
he just wants to live his life this way
the monkish monsignor
with a head full of plaster
said "my man, get your vile soul dry-cleaned"
as Rose counts the money in the cannister
as natural as rain
he dances again
vicar in a tu-tu
The next day in the pulpit
with Freedom and Ease
combating ignoranca,dust and disease
as Rose counts the money in the cannister
as natural as rain
he dances again
the fabric of a tu-tu
any man could get us to
and I am a living sign.

 

THERE IS A LIGHT THAT NEVER GOES OUT

Take me out tonight
where there's music and there's people
who are young and alive
driving in your car
I never never want to go home
because I havent got one
anymore
take me out tonight
because I want to see people and I
want to see lights
driving in your car
oh please dont drop me home
because it's not my home, it's their
home, and Im welcome no morw
and if a double-decker bus
crashes in to us
to die by your side
such a heavenly way to die
and if a ten ton truck
kills the both of us
to die by your side
the pleasure and the privilege is mine
take me out tonight
oh take me anywhere, I dont care
and in the darken underpass
I thought Oh God, my chance has come at last
(but then a strange fear gripped me and I just couldn't ask)
take me out tonight
take me anywhere, I dont care
just driving in your car
I never never want to go home
because I havent got one
I havent got one.

 

SOME GIRLS ARE BIGGER THAN OTHERS

From the ice-age to the dole-age
there is but one concern
and I have just discover
some girls are bigger than others
some girls are bigger than others
some girls mothers are bigger than
other girls mothers
As Anthony said to Cleopatra
as he opened a crate of ale:
some girls are bigger than others
some girls are bigger than others
some girls mothers are bigger than
other girls mothers.

 

A RUSH AND A PUSH AND AND THE LAND IS OURS

HELLO
I am the ghost of Troubled Joe
hung by his pretty white neck
some eighteen months ago
I travelled to a mystical time zone
but I missed my bed
so I soon came home
they said:
"there's too much caffeine
in your bloodstream
and a lack of real spice
in your life"
I said:
"leave me alone
because I'm alright, dad
just surprised to still
be on my own...."
Ooh, but don't mention love
I'd hate the real strain of the pain again
a rush and a push and the land that
we stand on is ours
it has been before
so it shall be again
and people who are uglier than you and I
they take what they need, and leave
Ooh, but don't mention love
I'd hate the pain and the strain all over again
a rush and a push and the land that
we stand on is ours
it has been before
so why can't it be now?
and people who are weaker than you and I
they take what they want from life
Ooh, but don't mention love
no - just don't mention love!
a rush and a push and the land that
we stand on is ours
your youth may be gone
but you're still a young man
so phone me, phone me, phone me
so phone me, phone me, phone me
Ooh, I think I'm in love...
Urrgh, I think I'm in lerv

 

I STARTED SOMETHING I COULDN'T FINISH

The lanes were silent
with nothing or no one around for miles
I doused our friendly venture
with a hard-faced
three-word gesture
I started something
I forced you into a zone
and you were clearly
never meant to go
hair brushed and parted
typical me, typical me, typical me
I started something
...and now I'm not too sure
I grabbed you by the guilded beams
that's what Tradition means
and I doused another venture
with a gesture
that was...absolutely vile
I started something
forced you to a zone
and you were clearly
never meant to go
hair brushed and parted
typical me, typical me, typical me
I started something
...and now I'm not too sure
I grabbed you by the guilded beams
that's what Tradition means
and now eighteen months' hard-labour
seems...fair enough
I started something
forced you to a zone
and you were clearly
never meant to go
hair brushed and parted
typical me, typical me, typical me
I started something
and now I'm not too sure

 

DEATH OF A DISCO DANCER

The death of a disco dancer
well, it happens a lot 'round here
and if you think Peace
is a common goal
well, that goes to show
just how little you know
The death of a disco dancer
well, I'd rather not get involved
I never talk to my neighbour
I'd just rather not get involved
Love, peace and harmony?
Love, peace and harmony?
Oh, very nice, very nice, very nice, very nice
...but maybe in the next world.

 

GIRLFRIEND IN A COMA

Girlfriend in a coma, I know
I know - it's serious
Girlfriend in a coma, I know
I know - it's really serious
there wree times when I could
have 'murdered' her
(but, you know, I would hate
anything to happen to her)
NO, I DON'T WANT TO SEE HER
Do you really think
she'll pull through?
Do you really think
she'll pull through?
Girlfriend in a coma, I know
I know, it's serious
there were time when I could
have 'strangeled' her
(but, you know, I would hate
anything to happen to her)
WOULD YOU PLEASE LET ME SEE HER!
Do you really think she'll pull through?
Do you really think she'll pull through?
Let me wisper my last goodbyes
I know - IT'S SERIOUS

 

STOP ME IF YOU'VE HEARD THIS ONE BEFORE

Stop me, stop me,
stop me if you think that you've heard this one before
stop me, stop me
stop me if you think that you've heard this one before
nothing's changed
I still love you, oh I still love you
...only slightly less than I used to
I was delayed, I was way-laid
an emergency stop
I smelt the last ten seconds of life
I crashed down on the crossbar
and the pain was enough to make
a shy, bald buddhist reflect
and plan a mass-murder
who said I'd lied to her?
who said I'd lied because I never
who said I'd lied because I never
I was detained, I was restrained
he broke my spleen
he broke my knees
(and then he really laid into me)
Friday night in Out-patients
who said I'd lied to her?
who said I'd lied - because I never
who said I'd lied - because I never
Oh, so I drank one
or was it four
and when I fell on the floor
...I drank more
stop me, stop me
stop me if you think that you've heard this one before
nothing's changed
I still love you, I still love you
but only slightly
less than I used to

 

LAST NIGHT I DREAMT THAT SOMEBODY LOVED ME

Last night I dreamt
that somebody loved me
no hope - but no harm
just another false alarm
Las night I felt
real arms around me
no hope - no harm
just another false alarm
so, tell me how long
before the last one?
and tell me how long
before the right one?
this story is old - I KNOW
but it goes on
this story is old - I KNOW
but it goes on

 

UNHAPPY BIRTHDAY

I've come to wish you an unhappy birthday
I've come to wish you an unhappy birthday
because you're evil
and you lie
and if you should die
I may feel slightly sad
(but I won't cry)
Loved and lost
and some may say
when usually its Nothing
surely you're happy
it should be this way?
I say "No, I'm gonna kill my dog"
and: "May the lines sag heavy
and deep tonight XXX"
I've come to wish you an unhappy birthday
I've come to wish you an unhappy birthday
because you're evil
and you lie
and if you should die
I may feel slightly sad
(But I won't cry)
Loved and lost
some people say
when usually its Nothing
surely you're happy
it should be this way?
I said "No"
and then I shot myself
so, drink, drink, drink
and be ill tonight
from the one you left behind
from the one you left behind...

 

PAINT A VULGAR PICTURE

At the record company meeting
On their hands - a dead star
and ooh, the plans that they weave
and ooh, the sikening greed
At the record company meeting
on their hands - a dead star
the sycophantic slags all say:
"I knew him first, and I knew him well"
Re-issue! Re-package! Re-package!
Re-evaluate the songs
double-pack with a photograph
Extra Track (and a tacky badge)
A-list, playlist
"Please them, please them!"
"Please them! Please them!"
(sadly, THIS was your life)
but you could have said no
if you'd wanted to
you could have said no
if you'd wanted to
BPI, MTV, BBC
"Please them! Please them!"
(sadly this was your life)
but you could have said no
if you'd wanted to
you could have walked away
...couldn't you?
I touched you at the soundcheck
you had no real way of knowing
in my heart I bgged "please, take
me with you...
I don't care where you're going"
But to you I was faceless
I was fawning, I was boring
just a child from those ugly new houses
who could never begin to know
who could never really know
Best of? Most of?
Satiate the need
slip them into different sleeves!
Buy both, and be decieved
climber - new entry, re-entry
World tour! ("media whore")
"Please the Press in Belgium!"
(THIS was your life...)
and when it fails to recoup?
Well, maybe:
You just haven't earned it yet, baby
I walked a pace behind you at the soundcheck
you're just the same as I am
what makes most people feel happy
leads us headlong into harm
so, in my bedroom in those 'ugly new houses'
I dance my legs down to the knees
but me and my 'true love'
we will never meet again...
At the record company meeting
on their hands - at last! - a dead star!
but they cannot taint you in my eyes
no, they cannout touch you now
No, they cannot hurt you my darling
they cannot touch you now
but me and my 'true love'
will never meet again

 

DEATH AT ONE'S ELBOW

Ooh Glenn, don't come to the house tonight
Ooh, Glenn, don't come to the house tonight
because there's somebody here
who really really loves you
stay home
be bored
(it's crap, I KNOW)
Ooh, Glenn, don't come to the house tonight
Ooh, Glen, don't come to the house tonight
because there's somebody here
who'll take a hatchet to your ear
how the frustration renders me
hateful, Glenn!
don't come to the house tonight
don't come to the house tonight
because you'll slip on the
trail of my bespattered remains
and so, that's why
GOODBYE MY LOVE, GOODBYE MY LOVE, GOODBYE MY LOVE...
Belch

 

I WON'T SHARE YOU

I won't share you
I won't share you
with the drive and ambition
and the zeal I feel
this is my time
as the note I wrote
was read, she said
has the Perrier gone
straight to my head
or is life plainly sick and cruel, instead?
"YES!"
No-no-no-no-no-no
I won't share you
I won't share you
with the drive and the dreams inside
this is my time
Life tends to come and go
well, that's OK
just as long as you know
Life tends to come and go
well, that's OK
just as long as you know
I won't share you
I won't share you
with the drive and the dreams inside
this is my time, this is my time


THE QUEEN IS DEAD

Farewell to this lands cheerless marches
hemmed in like a boar between arches
her very Lowness with her head in a sling
Im truely sorry-but it sounds like a wonderful thing
dear Charles, dont you ever crave
to appear on the front of the Daily mail
dressed in your Mother's bridal veil?
So, I checked all the registered historical facts
and I was shocked into shame to discover
how Im the 18th pale descendent
of some, old queen or other
has the world changed, or have I changed?
has the world changed, or have I changed?
as some 9-year old tough peddles drugs
(I never even knew what drugs were)
And so, I broke into the Palace
with a sponge and a rusty spanner
she said: "Eh, I know you, and you cannot sing"
I said: "that's nothing -you should hear me play piano"
We can go for a walk where it's quiet and dry
and we can talk about precious things
but when you are tied to your mother's apron
not one talks about castration
We can go for a walk where it's quiet and dry
and we can talk about precious things
like love and law and poverty
these are the things that kill me
We can go for a walk where it's quiet and dry
and we can talk about precious things
but the rain that flattens my hair
theses are the things that kill me
Passed the Pub that saps your body
and the church who'll snatch your money
the Queen is dead, boys
and it's so lonely on a limb
Pass the Pub that wrecks your body
and the church-all they want is your money
the Queen is dead, boys`
you can trust me, boys
life is very long, when you're lonely
life is very long, when you're lonely...

 

PANIC

Panic on the streets of London
Panic on the streets of Birmingham
I wonder to myself
Could life ever be sane again
on the Leeds side-streets that you slip down
I wonder to myself
Hopes may rise on the Grasmeres
But Honey Pie, you're not safe here
So you run down
To the safety of the town
But there's Panic on the streets of Carlisle
Dublin, Dundee, Humberside
I wonder to myself
Burn down the Disco
Hang the blessed D.J.
Because the music that they constantly play
IT SAYS NOTHING TO ME ABOUT MY LIFE
Hang the blessed D.J.
Because the music they constantly play
On the Leeds side-streets that you slip down
On the provincial towns that you jog 'round
Hang the D.J.,. Hang the D.J.,.Hang the D.J...

ASK

Shyness is nice, but
Shyness can stop you
From doing all the things in life
That you'd like to
So, if there's something you'd like to try
ASK ME-I WON'T SAY "NO"-HOW COULD I?
Coyness is nice, but ,
Coyness can stop you
from saying all the things in
life that you want to
If there's something that you'd like to try
ASK ME-I WON'TSAY"NO"-HOW COULD I?
Spending warm, Summer days indoors
Writing fringhtening verse
To a buck-toothed girl in Luxembourg
ASK ME, ASK ME ,ASK ME, ASK ME, ASK ME ,ASK ME
Because if it's not Love
Then it's the Bomb
That will bring us together
Nature is a language-can't you read?
Nature is a language-can't you read?
ASK ME, ASK ME ,ASK ME, ASK ME, ASK ME ,ASK ME
Because if it's not Love
Then it's the Bomb
That will bring us together

 

MARIE'S THE NAME (HIS LATEST FLAME) / RUSHOLME RUFFIANS

Very old friend 
Came by today 
As he was telling everyone in town 
Of all the love that he'd just found 
And Marie's the name (of his latest flame) 
Talked and talked 
And I heard him say 
That she had the longest blackest hair 
Prettiest green eyes anywhere 
And Marie's the name (of his latest flame) 
The last night of the fair 
By the big wheel generator 
A boy is stabbed 
His money is grabbed 
And the air hangs heavy like a dulling wine 
She is Famous 
She is Funny 
An engagement ring 
Doesn't mean a thing 
To a mind consumed by brass (money), oh 
The last night of the fair 
From a seat on a whirling waltzer 
Her skirt ascends for a watching eye 
It's a hideous trait (on her mother's side)
From a seat on a whirling waltzer 
Her skirt ascends for a watching eye 
A hideous trait (on her mother's side) 
Then someone falls in love 
Someone's beaten up 
Someone's beaten up 
And the senses being dulled are mine 
And someone falls in love 
Someone's beaten up 
And the senses being dulled are mine 
This is the last night of the fair 
And the grease in the hair 
Of a speedway operator 
Is all a tremulous heart requires 
A schoolgirl is denied 
She said : "How quickly would I die 
If I jumped from the top of the parachutes ?"
This is the last night of the fair 
And the grease in the hair 
Of a speedway operator 
Is all a tremulous heart requires 
A schoolgirl is denied 
She said : "How quickly would I die 
Oh, if I jumped from the top of the parachutes ?"
...Oh, walk home alone 
I might walk home alone 
But my faith in love is still devout

 

THE BOY WITH THE THORN IN HIS SIDE

The boy with the thorn in his side
behind the hatred there lies
a murderous desire for love
how can they look into my eyes
and still they dont believe me
how can they hear me say those words
and still they dont believe me
and if they don't believe me now
will they ever believe me?
and if they don't believe me now
will they ever believe me?
The boy with the thorn in his side
behind the hatred there lies
a plundering desire for love
how can they see the Love in our eyes
and still they don't believe us
and after all this time
they don't want to believe us
and if they dont believe us now
will they ever believe us ?
andd when you want to Live
how do you start ?
where do you go ?
who do you know?

 

RUBBER RING / WHAT SHE SAID

Yeah! What she says : 
"How come someone hasn't noticed 
That I'm dead 
And decided to bury me ? 
God knows, I'm ready !"
La-la-la ... 
What she said was sad 
But then, all the rejection she's had 
To pretend to be happy 
Could only be idiocy 
La-la-la ... 
What she said was not for the job or 
Lover that she never had 
No no no ... 
What she read 
All heady books 
She'd sit and prophesise 
(It took a tattooed boy from 
Birkenhead 
To really really open her eyes)
What she read 
All heady books 
She'd sit and prophesise 
(It took a tattooed boy from

Early death 
AND I NEED TO CLING TO SOMETHING !"
What she said : 
"I smoke because I'm hoping for an 
Early death

No no no no ...

 

IS IT REALLY SO STRANGE?

I left the North 
I travelled South 
I found a tiny house 
And I can't help the way I feel 
Oh yes, you can kick me 
And you can punch me 
And you can break my face 
But you won't change the way I feel 
'Cause I love you, Oh ... 
And is it really so strange ? 
Oh, is it really so strange ? 
Oh, is it really so, really so strange ? 
I say NO, you say YES 
(and you will change your mind) 
I left the South 
I travelled North 
I got confused - I killed a horse 
I can't help the way I feel 
Oh yes, you can punch me 
And you can butt me 
And you can break my spine 
But you won't change the way I feel 
'Cause I love you, Oh ... 
And is it really so strange ? 
Oh, is it really so strange ? 
Oh, is it really so, really so strange ? 
I say NO, you say YES 
(But you will change your mind) 
I left the North again 
I travelled South again 
And I got confused - I killed a nun 
I CAN'T HELP THE WAY I FEEL 
(I lost my bag in Newport Pagnell) 
Why is the last mile the hardest mile ? 
My throat was dry, with the sun in my eyes 
And I realised, I realised 
I could never 
I could never, never, never, go back home again

 

CEMETERY GATES

A dreaded sunny day
so I meet you at the cemetry gates
Keats and Yeats are on your side
A dreaded sunny day
so I meet you at the cemetry gates
Keats and Yeats are on your side
while Wilde is on mine
So we go inside and we gravely read the stones
all those people all those lives
where are they now ?
with loves, and hates
and passions just like mine
they were born
and then they lived and then they died
which seems so unfair
and I wantr to crv
You say: "ere thrice the sun hath done salutation to the dawn"
and you claim these words as your own
but Im well-read, have heard them said
a hundred times (maybe less, maybe more)
if you must write prose/poems
the words you use should be your own
dont plagiarise or take "on loans"
there's alweays someone, somewhere
with a big nose, who knows
and who trips you up and laughs
when you fall
You say: "ere long done do does did "
words which could only be your own
you then produce the text
from whence was ripped
(some dizzy whore, 1804)
A dreaded sunny day
so let's go where we're happy
so I meet you at the cemetry gates
Keats and Yeats are on your side
A dreaded sunny day
so let's go where we're wanted
so I meet you at the cemetry gates
Keats and Yeats are on your side
but you lose
because Wilde is on mine

 

LONDON

Smoke
Lingers 'round your fingers
Train
Heave on - to Euston
Do you think you've made
The right decision this time?
You left
Your tired family grieving
And you think they're sad because you're leaving
But didn't you see the Jealousy in the eyes
Of the ones who had to stay behind?
And do you think you've made
The right decision thins time?
You left
Your girlfriend on the platform
With thei really ragged notion that you'll return
But she knows
That when he goes
He really goes
So do you think you've made
The right decision this time?

 

I KNOW IT'S OVER

I can feel the soil falling over my head 
And as I climb into an empty bed 
Oh well. Enough said. 
I know it's over - still I cling 
I don't know where else I can go 
Over ... 
Oh Mother, I can feel the soil falling over my head 
See, the sea wants to take me 
The knife wants to cut me 
Do you think you can help me ? 
Sad veiled bride, please be happy 
Handsome groom, give her room 
Loud, loutish lover, treat her kindly 
(Though she needs you 
More than she loves you) 
And I know it's over - still I cling 
I don't know where else I can go 
Over, it's over, it's over, it's over 
It's over, la ... 
I know it's over 
And it never really began 
But in my heart it was so real
And you even spoke to me, and said : 
"If you're so funny 
Then why are you on your own tonight ? 
And if you're so clever 
Then why are you on your own tonight ? 
I know ... 
'Cause tonight - it's just like any other night 
That's why you're on your own tonight 
Your triumphs and your charms 
While they're in each other's arms..."
It's so easy to laugh 
It's so easy to hate 
It takes strength to be gentle and kind 
Over, over, over, over 
It's so easy to laugh 
It's so easy to hate 
It takes guts to be gentle and kind 
Over, over 
Love is Natural and Real 
But not for you, my love 
Not tonight, my love 
Love is Natural and Real 
But not for such as you and I, my love 
Oh Mother, I can feel the soil falling over my head...
Oh Mother, I can feel the soil fall over, fall over my head 
Oh Mother, I can feel the ... fall over my ... , Oh ...

 

THE DRAIZE TRAIN

A vastly superior version of the instrumental B-side, acting as a peace 
offering to Marr (Morrissey chose the tracks for the compilation, 
and of course, receives no royalties on this track).

 

STILL ILL

I decree today that life
is simply taking and not giving
England is mine and it owes me a living
ask me why, and I'll spit in your eye
ask me why, and I'll spit in your eye
but we cannot cling to the old dreams anymore
no, we cannot cling to the old dreams anymore
Does the body rule the mind
or does the mind rule the body?
I dunno...
Under the iron bridge we kissed
and although I ended up with sore lips
it just wasn't like the old days anymore
no, it wasn't like those days
am I still ill?
Does the body rule the mind
or does the mind rule the body ?
I dunno...
Ask me why, and I'll die
ask me why, and I'll die
and if you must go to work tomorrow
well, if I were you I wouldn't bother
for there are brighter sides to life
and I should know because I've seen them
but not very often...
under the iron bridge we kissed
and although I ended up with sore lips
it just wasn't like the old days anymore
no, it wasn't like those days
am I still ill?

 

BIGMOUTH STRIKES AGAIN

Sweetness, sweetness I was only joking
when I said Id like to smash every tooth
in your head
Sweetness, sweetness I was only joking
when I said by right s you should be
bludgeoned in your bed
and now I know how Joan of Arc felt
now I know how Joan of Arc felt
as the flames roseto her roman nose
and her Walkman stared to melt
Bibmouth, bigmouth
bigmouth strikes again
and Ive got no right to take my place
with the Human race
and now I know how Joan of Arc felt
now I know of Joan of Arc felt
as the flames rose to her roman nose
and her hearing aid started to melt
Bigmouth, bigmouth
bigmouth strikes again
and Ive got no right to take my place
with the Human race

 
ALSATIAN COUSTIN

Were you and he Lovers?
and would you say so if you were?
on a forecourt
on a Friday
passing my way
Were you and he Lovers?
and if you were, then say that you were!
on a groundsheet
under canvas
with your tent-flap
open wide
A note upon his desk:
"P.S. Bring Me Home And Have Me!"
Leather elbows on a tweed coat
- Oh! -
Is THAT the best you can do?
So came his reply:
"...but on the desk is where I want you!"
So I ask (even though I know):
were you and he Lovers?

 

LITTLE MAN, WHAT NOW?

An afternoon nostalgia
television show
you spoke in silhouette
(but they couldn't name you)
although the panel were
very polite to you
but I remembered you
from Friday nights 1969
ATV - you murdered every line
too old to be a child star
too young to take leads
four seasons passed
and they AXED you
nervously juvenile
(WON'T SMILE!)
What became of you?
did that swift eclipse torture you?
a star at eighteen
and then-suddenly gone
down to a few lines
in the back page of a teenage annual
oh but I remembered you
I looked up to you

 

EVERYDAY IS LIKE SUNDAY

Trudging slowly over wet sand
back to the bench
where your clothes were stolen
this is the coastal town
that they forgot to close down
Armageddon - come Armageddon!
Come Armageddon! Come!
Everyday is like Sunday
everyday is silent and grey
Hide on the promenade
scratch out a postcard
"how I dearly with I was not here"
in the seaside town
...that they forgot to bomb
Come! Come! Come - nuclear bomb!
Everyday is like Sunday
everyday is silent and grey
Trudging back over pebbles and sand
and a strange dust lands on your hands
(and on your face)
Everyday is like Sunday
"Win Yourself A Cheap Tray"
share some greased tea with me
everyday is silent and grey

 

BENGALI IN PLATFORMS

No no no
he does not want to depress you
oh no no no no no
he only wants to impress you
Bengali in platform
she only wants to embrace your culture
and to be your friend forever
Bengali, Bengali
oh shelve your Western plans
and understand that life is hard enough when you belong here
A silver-studded rim that glistens
and an ankle-star that...blinds me
a lemon sole so very high
which only reminds me, to tell you
so I break the news gently
I break the news to you gently
"Shelve your plans"
Bengali, Bengali
its the touchy march of time
that blinds you
don't blame me
don't hate me
just because I'm the one to tell you
that life is hard enough when you belong here
life is hard enough when you belong here
shelve your western plans
life is hard enough when you belong here

 

ANGEL, ANGEL, DOWN WE GO TOGETHER

Angel, Angel
don't take your life tonight
I know they take
and that they take in turn
and they give you nothing real
for yourself in return
and when they've used you
and they've broken you
and wasted all your money
and cast your shell aside
and when they've bought you
and they've sold you
and they've billed you for the pleasure
and they've made your parents cry
I will be here
BELIEVE ME
I will be here
...believe me
Angel, don't take your life
some people have got no pride
they do not understand
the Urgency of life
but I love you more than life
I love you more than life
I love you more than life
I love you more than life

 

LALE NIGHT, MAUDLIN STREET

The last night on Maudlin Street
goodbye house
goodbye stairs
I was born here
I was raised here, and
...I took some stick here
love at first sight
may sound trite
but it's true, you know
I could list the details
of everything you ever wore
or said, or how you stood that day
and as we spend the last night
on Maudlin Street, I say
"goodbye house-forever!"
I never stole a happy hour
around here
Where the world's ugliest boy
became what you see
here I am - the ugliest man
Its the last night on Maudlin Street
and truly I do love you
oh, truly I do love you
When I sleep with that picture of
you framed beside my bed
oh, it's childish and it's silly
but I think it's you in my room
by the bed (...yes, I told you it was silly...)
and I know
I took strange pills
but I never meant to hurt you
oh truly I love you
I came home late one night
everyone had gone to bed
nobody stays up for you
when you have sixteen stitches
all around your head
the last buss I missed to Maudlin Street
so, he drove me home in the Van
complaining: "Women only like me for my mind..."
don't leave your torch behind
power-cuts ahead
as we crept through the park
but no I cannot steal a pair of jeans
off a clothesline for you
but you...without clothes
oh I could not keep a straight face
me - without clothes?
well a nation turns its back and gags...
I'm packed
I am moving house
a half-life disappears today
every slag waves me on
(secretly wishing me gone
well, I will be soon
oh - I will be soon)
There were bad times on Maudlin Street
when they took you away in a police car
dear Inspector - don't you know?
don't you care?
don't you know - about Love?
Your gran died
and your mother died
on Maudlin Street
in pain and ashamed
with never time to say
those special things
I took the keys from Maudlin Street
well, it's only bricks and mortar!
and...truly I do love you
wherever you are
wherever you are

 

SUEDHEAD

Why do you come here
why do you hang around
I'm so sorry
I'm so sorry
Why do you come here
when you know it makes
things hard for me
when you know, oh
why do you come?
Why do you telephone?
and why send me silly notes?
I'm so sorry
I'm so sorry
why do you come here
when you know it makes
thing hard for me
when you know, oh
why do you come?
You had to sneak into my room
'just' to read my diary
was it just to see all the things
you knew I'd written about you?
and...so many illustrations
I'm so very sickened
oh, I am so sickened NOW

 

BREAK UP THE FAMILY

The strange logic of your clumsiest line
stayed emblazoned on my mind
break up the family
and lets begin to live our lives
I went to see all my friends tonight
it wasn't Youth, it wasn't even Life
born Old, sadly wise
resigned (well, we were)
to ending our lives
I'm so glad to grow older
to move away from those awful times
I want to see all my friends tonight
Yes you found love but you weren't
at peace with your life
home late, full of Hate
despise the ties that bind
oh I'm so glad to grow older
to move away from those younger years
now I'm in love for the first time
and I don't feel bad
Let me see all my old friends
let me put my arm around them
because I really do love them
now, does that sound mad?
Captain of games, solid framed
I stood on the touchline
hailstones, driven home
in his car - no breaks? I don't mind
I'm just so glad to grow older
to move away from those darker years
I'm in love for the first time
and I don't feel bad
so wish me luck my friends
goodbye

 

HAIRDRESSER ON FIRE

Here is London
here is London
is it home of the free,
or what?
can you squeeze me
into an empty page of your diary
and psychologically save me
I've got faith in you
I sense the power
in the fingers
within an hour the power
can totally destroy me
or it could same my life
here is London
'home of the brash, outrageous
and free'
you are repressed
but you're remarkably dressed
is it Real?
but you're far to busy
busy scissors
busy clippers
hair dresser on fire
all around Sloane Square
and you're far too busy
to see me
"busy,busy"
hairdresser on fire
was a client over-cautious
he made you nervous
and when he said
"I'm gonna sue you"
I really felt for you
so can you squeeze me
into an empty page of your diary
and supernaturally change me
CHANGE ME, CHANGE ME

 

THE ORDINARY BOYS

Ordinary boys, happy knowing nothing
happy being no one, but themselves
Ordinary girls, supermarket clothes
who think it's very clever to be cruel to you
for you were so different
you stood all alone
and you knew
that it had to be so
avoiding ordinary boys
happy going nowhere, just around here
in their rattling cars
and ordinary girls
never seeing further
than the cold, small streets
that trap them
but you were so different
you had to say no
when those empty fools
tried to change you, and claim you
for the lair of their ordinary world
where they feel so lucky
so lucky, so lucky
with their lives laid out before them
they're so lucky, so lucky
so lucky, so lucky

 

I DON'T MIND IF YOU FORGET ME

I don't mind
I don't mind if you forget me
having learned my lesson
I never left an impression on anyone
so now you send me your hardened 'regards'
when once you'd send me 'love'
sincerely I must tell you
your mild 'best wishes'
they make me suspicious
but I don't mind
I don't mind if you forget me
having learned my lesson
I never left
an impression on anyone
the pressure to change, to move on
was strange
and very strong
so this is why I tell you
I really do understand
BYE BYE
I don't mind if you forget me
no no no no no no no
REJECTION IS ONE THING
BUT REJECTION FROM A FOOL
IS CRUEL
REJECTION IS ONE THING
BUT REJECTION FROM A FOOL
IS CRUEL
and I don't mind if you forget me
I don't mind if your forget me

 

DIAL-A-CLICHE

Further into the fog I fall
well, I was just
following you!
when you said:
"Do as I do and scrap your fey ways"
(dial-a-cliche)
"grow up, be a man, and close your mealy-mouth!"
(dial-a-cliche)
But the person underneath
where does he go?
does he slide by the wayside?
or...does he just die?
when you find that you've organized
your feelings, for people
who didn't like you then
and certainly don't like you now
yet still you say:
"Do as I do and scrap your fey ways"
(dial-a-cliche)
"grow up, be a man, and close your mealy-mouth!"
(dial-a-cliche)
"the Safe way is the only way!
there's always time to change, son!"
yes well I've changed
but I'm in pain!
dial-a-chiche

 

MARGARET ON THE GUILLOTINE

The kind people
have a wonderful dream
Margaret on the guillotine
because people like you
make me feel so tired
when will you die?
when will you die?
when will you die?
when will you die?
when will you die?
because people like you
make me feel so old inside
please die
and kind people
do not shelter this dream
make it real
make the dream real
make the dream real
make it real

 

OUR FRANK

Our frank and open
deep conversations
they get me nowhere
they bring me down, so
give it a rest, won't you?
give me a cigarette
God give me patience
just no more conversation
Give us a drink
and make it quick
or else I'm gonna be sick
sick all over
your frankly vulgar
red pullover
now see how the colours blend
Our frank and open
deep conversations
they get me nowhere
they bring me down, so
give it a rest, won't you?
now will you just give over
the world may be ending
but look, I'm only human
Give us a drink
and make it quick
or else I'm gonna be sick
all over
your frankly vulgar
red pullover
now see how the two colours blend
Won't somebody stop me
from thinking all the time
about everything
so deeply
so bleakly

 

ASIAN RUT

Day oh so late
strangely the sun still shone
oh Asian boy
what are you on?
Day oh so late
strangely the sun still shone
what drugs are you on?
Tooled-up Asian boy
has come here to avenge
the cruel, cold killing
of his very best friend
Tooled-up Asian boy
has come here to take revenge
for the cruel, cold killing
of his only friend
Peace through the school
so quiet in the hall
it's a strange sign for one
of what's to come
Tough and hard and pale
oh they may just impale you on railings
oh English boys
it must be wrong
three against one?
Brakes slammed, and
a gun jammed, and
as far as I could tell
brave Asian boy
dealt a blow and fell
I'm just passing through here
on my way to somewhere civilised
and maybe I'll even arrive
maybe I'll even arrive?

 

SING YOUR LIFE

Sing your life
any fool can think of words that rhyme
many others do
why don't you?
do you want to?
Sing your life
just walk right up to the microphone
and name
all the things that you love
all the things that you loathe
sing your life
all the things that you love
all the things that you loathe
oh sing your life
oh sing your life
Others sang your life
but now's your chance to shine
and have the pleasure of
saying what you mean
the rare pleasure of
meaning what you sing
oh, make no mistake, my friend
all of this will end
so sing it now
all the things you love
all the things you loathe
oh sing your life
all the things that you love
all the things that you loathe
oh sing your, oh sing your
Don't leave it all unsaid
somewhere in the wasteland of your head
and make no mistake, my friend
your pointless life will end
but before you go
can you look at the truth?
You have a lovely singing voice
a lovely singing voice
and all of those
who sing on key
they stole the notion
from you and me

 

MUTE WITNESS

Your poor witness
crying so loudly on the floor
oh but she's only trying to tell you
what it was that she saw
she is only trying to tell you
what it was that she saw
Now see her standing on the table
with her small arms flailing
and you feel such compassion
in your soul for
Your poor mute witness
still testing the strength
of our patience
oh but she's only trying to tell you
what it was that she saw
Now see her pointing to the frisbee
with a memory too fuzzy
as her silent words
describe the fright of last night
4 a.m. Norhtside, Clapham Common
who knows what she was doing there?
will she sketch the answer later?
Well, I'll ask her
"now dry your tears, my dear"
Now see her mime in time so nicely
it would all have been so clear
is only she had never volunteered
"your taxi is here, my dear"

 

KING LEER

Your boyfriend, he
went down on one knee
well, could it be
he's only got one knee?
I tried to surprise you
with Vodka
or, Tizer
I can't quite remember
but you didn't thank me
you didn't even thank me
because you never do
Your boyfriend, he
has the gift of the gab
or, could it be
the gift of the grab?
I tried to surprise you
I lay down beside you
and...nothing much happened
and you didn't phone me
you didn't even phone me
because it's not your style
to dial
Your boyfriend, he
displays to me
more than just
a hint of cruelty
I tried to surprise you
I crept up behind you
with a homeless chihuahua
you gushed for an hour
you handed him back and said
"You'll never guess
I'm bored now"

 

FOUND FOUND FOUND

found found found found found found
someone who's worth it
in this murkiness
someone who's never
seeming scheming
found found found found found found
someone who's worth it
in this murkiness
someone who's never
seeming scheming
Oh, but if I'd never found
oh, but if I'd never found
oh, but if I'd never found
I do believe that
the more you give your love
and I do believe that
the more you offer trust
the more you chase
the more you cry
the more you're bound to lose
the more you're bound to lose
Oh, but if I'd never found
oh, but if I'd never found
somebody
who wants to be
who wants to be
with me
all the time

 

DRIVING YOUR GIRLFRIEND HOME

I'm driving
your girlfriend home
and she's saying
how she never chose you
"turn left", she says
so I turn left
and she says
"So how did I end up
so deeply involved in
the very existence
I planned on avoiding?"
and I can't answer
I'm driving
your girlfriend home
and she's laughing
to stop herself crying
"drive on", she says
so I drive on
and she says
"So how did I end up
attached to this person
when his sense of humour
gets gradually worser?"
and I can't tell her
I'm parking
outside her home
and we're shaking hands
goodnight, so politely

 

THE HARSH TRUTH OF THE CAMERA EYE

Churchillian legs
hair barely there
the harsh truth of the camera eye
Your eyes signal pain
because of the strain
of smiling
the harsh truth of the camera eye
telling you all
that you never wnated to know
showing what
you didn't want shown
My so friendly lens
zooms into
"the inner you"
and it tells the harsh truth
and nothing but
Laugh with us all here
that's if you can
then take the pictures home
and screamtelling you all
that you never wanted to know
showing you what
you didn't want shown
This photographer
he must have really had it in for you
"Oh, I don't want
to be judged anymore
I don't wnat to be judged
I would sooner be Loved
I would sooner be
just blindly Loved..."

 

(I'M) THE END OF THE FAMILY LINE

With no complications
fifteen generations
(of mine)
all honouring Nature
until I arrive
(with incredible style)
I'm the end fo the line
the end of the family line
the end of the line
No baby pulled screaming
out into this seething whirl
by chance or whim
(or even love?)
our family tree hacked into decline
and I'm spared the pain
of ever saying
("goodbye")
I'm the end of the line
the end of the family line
the end of the line

 

THERE'S A PLACE IN HELL FOR ME AND MY FRIENDS

There is a place
reserved
for me and my friends
and when we go
we all will go
so you see
I'm never alone
there is a place
with a bit more time
and a few more
gentler words
and looking back
we do forgive
(we had no choice
we always did)
all that we hope
is that when we go
our skin
and our blood
and our bones
don't get in your way
making you ill
the way they did
when we lived
There is a place
a place in hell
reserved
for me and my friends
and if ever I
wanted to cry
then I will
because I can

 

TONY THE PONY

Still drinking on the corner 
Just don't say I didn't warn you 
Always nagging big brother 
He's only looking out for you 
Tony The Pony 
Tony The Pony 
You're still standing on the corner 
Just don't say I didn't warn you 
Old and jealous big brother 
You had your time and you spent it 
Crying 
Now, Tony The Pony 
Tony The Pony 
So, that's what they call you now ? 
When you're free outside 
So cold and hard and in control 
And ... 
There's a free ride on 
Tony The Pony 
Oh, why do you always wanna stop me 
From doing the things in life that make me happy ? 
And when I'm outside with friends, laughing loudly 
Why do you always wanna stop me ? 
Oh, I would never 
I would never 
But you will carry the can for anyone 
The free ride on 
Gullible Tony 
You're drunker quicker 
And you're sicker even quicker 
For something heavy is gonna fall on you 
Oh ... 
And what do they call you now ? 
When you're free outside 
So cold and hard and in control 
And, oh ... been a lark 
There's a free ride on 
Fucked-up Tony 
I will never say I told you so 
Or how I knew that something bad 
Would happen to you 
I don't wanna say I told you so 
Oh, but Tony, I told you so !!! 
I told you so

 

YOU'RE GONNA NEED SOMEONE ON YOUR SIDE

With the world's fate 
Resting on your shoulder 
You're gonna need 
Someone on your side 
You can't do it by yourself 
Any longer 
You're gonna need 
Someone on your side 
Someone kindly told me 
That you'd wasted 
Eight of nine lives
Oh, give yourself a break 
Before you break down 
You're gonna need someone on your side 
And here I am, And here I am 
Well, you don't need 
To look so pleased ! 
Day or night, 
There is no difference 
You're gonna need someone on your side 
Day or night, 
There is no difference 
You're gonna need someone soon 
And here I am, And here I am 
Well, you don't need 
To look so pleased

 

GLAMOROUS GLUE

First day with the jar 
You find 
Everyone lies 
First day with the jar 
You find 
Everyone lies, nobody minds 
Everyone lies 
Where is the man you respect ? 
And where is the woman you love ? 
Where's the woman you love ? 
Third week with the jar
You find 
Everything dies 
We won't vote Conservative 
Because we never have 
Everyone lies, everyone lies 
Where is the man you respect ? 
And where is the woman you love ? 
Where's the woman you love ? 
Everything of worth 
On Earth Is there To share 
I used to dream, and I used to vow 
I wouldn't dream of it now 
We look to Los Angeles 
For the language we use 
London is dead, London is dead, London is dead...
Now I'm too much in love 
I'm too much in love 
I know 
I'll go 
Empty hand 
From the land

 

WE'LL LET YOU KNOW

How sad are we ? 
And how sad have we been ? 
We'll let you know 
We'll let you know 
Oh, but only if - you're really interested 
You wonder how 
We've stayed alive 'till now 
We'll let you know 
We'll let you know 
But only if - you're really interested 
We're all smiles 
Then, honest, I swear, it's the turnstiles 
That make us hostile 
Oh ... 
We will descend 
On anyone unable to defend 
Themselves 
Oh ... 
And the songs we sing 
They're not supposed to mean a thing 
La, la, la, la ... 
Oh ...You're lonely, Oh ... you're lonely, Oh ... 
GET OFF THE ROOF ! Oh ... 
Your Arsenal !
We may seem cold, or 
We may even be 
The most depressing people you've ever known 
At heart, what's left, we sadly know 
That we are the last truly British people you'll ever know 
We are the last truly British people you will ever know 
You'll never never want to know

 

THE NATIONAL FRONT DISCO

David, the wind blows 
The wind blows ... 
Bits of your life away 
Your friends all say ... 
"Where is our boy ? Oh, we've lost our boy" 
But they should know 
Where you've gone 
Because again and again you've explained that 
You're going to ... 
Oh, you're going to ... 
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah 
England for the English ! 
England for the English ! 
David, the winds blow 
The winds blow ...
All of my dreams away 
And I still say : 
"Where is our boy ? Ah, we've lost our boy" 
But I should know 
Why you've gone 
Because again and again you've explained
You've gone to the ... 
National, ah ... 
To the National .. 
There's a country; you don't live there 
But one day you would like to 
And if you show them what you're made of 
Oh, then you might do ... 
But David, we wonder 
We wonder if the thunder 
Is ever really gonna begin 
Begin, begin 
Your mom says : 
"I've lost my boy" 
But she should know 
Why you've gone 
Because again and again you've explained 
You've gone to the : 
National 
To the National 
To the National Front Disco 
Because you want the day to come sooner 
You want the day to come sooner 
You want the day to come sooner 
When you've settled the score 
Oh, the National 
Oh, the National

 

CERTAIN PEOPLE I KNOW

I take the cue from 
Certain people I know 
I use the cue 
And then I 
Hand it on to you 
And when I swing it 
So, it catches his eye ... 
(Weren't you there ? 
- You'd have died !) 
I trust the views of 
Certain people I know 
They look at Danger 
And they 
LAUGH THEIR HEADS OFF 
Their clothes are Imitation 
George the 23rd 
(Don't you find this absurd ?) 
I'd hate to be like 
Certain people I know 
They break their necks 
And can't afford to
Get them fixed 
Ah, they'd sacrifice all 
Of their principles for 
anything cashable 
I do believe it's terrible 
Oh, wo, wo, Ah, ah, ah, ah, Oh, wo, wo...

 

WE HATE IT WHEN OUR FRIENDS BECOME SUCCESSFUL

We hate it when our friends become successful 
We hate it when our friends become successful 
Oh, look at those clothes 
Now look at that face, it's so old 
And such a video ! 
Well, it's really laughable 
Ha, ha, ha ...
We hate it when our friends become successful 
And if they're Northern, that makes it even worse
And if we can destroy them 
You bet your life we will 
Destroy them 
If we can hurt them 
Well, we may as well ... 
It's really laughable 
Ha, ha, ha ... 
You see, it should've been me 
It could've been me 
Everybody knows 
Everybody says so 
They say : 
"Ah, you have loads of songs 
So many songs 
More songs than they'd stand 
Verse 
Chorus 
Middle eight 
Break, fade 
Just listen ..."
La, la-la, la-la

 

YOU'RE THE ONE FOR ME, FATTY

You're the One for me, fatty 
You're the One I really, really love 
And I will stay 
Promise you'll say 
If I'm in your way
You're the One for me, fatty 
You're the One I really, really love 
And I will stay 
Promise you'll say 
If I'm ever in your ...
A-hey 
All over Battersea 
Some hope; and some despair 
All over Battersea 
Some hope; and some despair 
Oh ... You're the One for me, fatty 
You're the One I really, really love 
And I will stay 
Promise you'll say

You're the One for me, fatty

SEASICK, YET STILL DOCKED

I am a poor freezingly cold soul 
So far from where 
I intended to go 
Scavenging through life's very constant lulls 
So far from where I'm determined to go 
Wish I knew the way to reach the one I love
There is no way ... 
Wish I had the charm to attract the one I love 
But you see, I've got no charm 
Mmm...
Tonight I've consumed much more than I can hold 
Oh, this is very clear to you 
And you can tell I have never really loved 
You can tell, by the way, I sleep all day
And all of my life no-one gave me anything 
No-one has ever given me anything 
My love is as sharp as a needle in your eye 
You must be such a fool 
To pass me by

 

I KNOW IT'S GONNA HAPPEN SOMEDAY

My love, wherever you are 
Whatever you are 
Don't lose faith 
I know it's gonna happen someday 
To you 
Please wait ... Please wait ... Oh ... Wait ... 
Don't lose faith 
You say that the day just never arrives 
And it's never seemed so far away 
Still, I know it's gonna happen someday 
To you 
Please wait ... 
Don't lose faith

 

TOMORROW

Tomorrow 
Will it really come ? 
And if it does come 
Will I still be Human ? 
All I ask of you is one thing that you never do 
Would you put your arms around me ? 
(I won't tell anyone) 
Tomorrow 
Does it have to come ?
All I ask of you is one thing that you'll never do 
Would you put your arms around me ? 
(I won't tell anybody) 
Tomorrow 
And what must come before ...
Oh, the pain in my arms 
Oh, the pain in my legs 
Ooh, my shiftless body 
Tomorrow 
It's surely nearer now ? 
You don't think I'll make it 
I never said I wanted to ! 
Well did I ? 
Oh, the pain in my arms 
Oh, the pain in my legs 
Oh, yeah; oh, yeah, No, yeah; no, yeah 
Through my shiftless body 
Tomorrow, Tomorrow 
All I ask of you ... oh ... 
Is : would you tell me that you love me 
Tell me, tell me that you love me, Tell me, tell me that you love me ... 
Ah, I know you don't mean it 
Ah, I know you don't mean it 
Tell me, tell me that you love me, Tell me, tell me that you love me ...

And I will stay 
Promise you'll say

CERTAIN PEOPLE I KNOW

I take the cue from 
Certain people I know 
I use the cue And then I 
Hand it on to you 
And when I swing it 
So, it catches his eye ... 
(Weren't you there ? 
- You'd have died !) 
I trust the views of 
Certain people I know 
They look at Danger 
And they 
LAUGH THEIR HEADS OFF 
Their clothes are Imitation 
George the 23rd 
(Don't you find this absurd ?) 
I'd hate to be like 
Certain people I know 
They break their necks 
And can't afford to
Get them fixed 
Ah, they'd sacrifice all 
Of their principles for 
anything cashable 
I do believe it's terrible 
Oh, wo, wo Ah, ah, ah, ah Oh, wo, wo...

 

THE NATIONAL FRONT DISCO

David, the wind blows 
The wind blows ... 
Bits of your life away 
Your friends all say ... 
"Where is our boy ? Oh, we've lost our boy" 
But they should know 
Where you've gone 
Because again and again you've explained that 
You're going to ... 
Oh, you're going to ... 
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah 
England for the English ! 
England for the English ! 
David, the winds blow 
The winds blow ...
All of my dreams away 
And I still say : 
"Where is our boy ? Ah, we've lost our boy" 
But I should know 
Why you've gone 
Because again and again you've explained
You've gone to the ... 
National, ah ... To the National .. 
There's a country; you don't live there 
But one day you would like to 
And if you show them what you're made of 
Oh, then you might do ... 
But David, we wonder 
We wonder if the thunder 
Is ever really gonna begin 
Begin, begin 
Your mom says : 
"I've lost my boy" 
But she should know 
Why you've gone 
Because again and again you've explained 
You've gone to the : 
National, To the National 
To the National Front Disco 
Because you want the day to come sooner 
You want the day to come sooner 
You want the day to come sooner 
When you've settled the score 
Oh, the National, Oh, the National…

 

NOVEMBER SPAWNED A MONSTER

Sleep on and dream of Love
because it's the closest you will get to love
poor twisted child, so ugly, so ugly
poor twisted child, oh hug me, oh hug me
one November spawned a monster 
in the shape of this child who later cried
"But Jesus made me, so Jesus save me from
pity, sympathy and people discussing me"
a frame of useless limbs what can make GOOD
all the BAD that's been done?
And if the lights were out
could you even bear
to kiss her full on the mouth (or anywhere?)
poor twisted child, so ugly, so ugly
poor twisted child, oh hug me, oh hug me
one November spawned a monster 
in the shape of this child who must remain
a hostage to kindess and the wheels underneath her
a hostage to kindess and the wheels underneath her
a symbol of where mad, mad lovers
must PAUSE and draw the line
So sleep and dream of love
because it's the closest
you will get to love
that November is a time which I must put OUT of my mind
oh one fine day 
LET IT BE SOON
she won't be rich or beautiful
but she'll be walking your streets
in the clothes that she went out
and chose for herself

 

SEASICK, YET STILL DOCKED

I am a poor freezingly cold soul 
So far from where 
I intended to go 
Scavenging through life's very constant lulls 
So far from where I'm determined to go 
Wish I knew the way to reach the one I love
There is no way ... 
Wish I had the charm to attract the one I love 
But you see, I've got no charm 
Mmm...
Tonight I've consumed much more than I can hold 
Oh, this is very clear to you 
And you can tell I have never really loved 
You can tell, by the way, I sleep all day
And all of my life no-one gave me anything 
No-one has ever given me anything 
My love is as sharp as a needle in your eye 
You must be such a fool 
To pass me by

 

THE LOOP

I just wanna say 
I haven't been away 
I'm still right here 
Where I always was 
So one day, if you're bored 
By all means call 
Because you can do 
(But only if you want to) 
I just wanna say 
I haven't been away 
I am still right here 
Where I always was 
So one day, when you're bored 
By all means call 
Because you can do 
But you might not get through

 

SISTER I'M A POET

All over this town 
Yes, a low wind may blow 
And I can see through everybo... 
With no reason 
To hide these words I feel 
And no reason 
To talk about the books I read 
But still I do 
That's 'cause I'm a ... Sister I'm a ... 
All over this town 
Along this way 
Outside the prison gates 
I love the romance of crime 
And I wonder 
Does anybody feel the way I do ? 
And is evil just something you are 
Or something you do ? 
Sister I'm a ... Sister I'm a ... 
All over this town, All over this town 
They pull over 
In their Citroen vans 
Not to shake your hand 
With meths on their breaths 
And you with youth on your side 
A plastic bag stranded at the lights 
This once was me ...
But now I'm a ... Sister I'm a ...
All over this town ... Oh, oh, oh 
All over this town, All over this town, Oh ... 
I still cannot speak French ... I am very lazy

 

JACK THE RIPPER

Oh, you look so tired 
Mouth slack and wide 
Ill-housed and ill-advised 
Your face is as mean 
As your life has been 
Crash into my arms 
I WANT YOU 
You don't agree -
But you don't refuse 
I know you 
And I know a place 
Where no one is likely to pass 
Oh, you don't care if it's late 
And you don't care if you're lost 
And oh, you look so tired 
(But tonight you presumed too much) 
Too much, too much 
And if it's the last 
Thing I ever do 
I'M GONNA GET YOU 
Crash into my arms 
I WANT YOU 
You don't agree -
But you don't refuse 
I know you 
And no one knows a thing about my life 
I can come and go as I please 
And if I want to, I can stay 
Oh, or if I want to, I can leave 
Nobody knows me, Nobody knows me, Nobody knows me Oh, oh...

 

SUCH A LITTLE THING MAKES SUCH A BIG DIFFERENCE

Such a little thing, such a little thing
but the difference it made was grave
there you go
wielding a bicycle chain
oh why won't you change
cange and be nicer?
such a little thing
a gentle tone of kindness
or written words on paper
- can you write?
How I love all of
the very simple things of life
(God's good air)
how I love all of
the very simple things of life
such a little thing
a fumbling politeness
the difference it saved me
wielding a bicycle chain
"I WILL NOT CHANGE AND I WILL NOT BE NICE"
Most people keep their brains between your legs (don't you find?)
Leave me alone - I was only singing, leave me alone because
I was only singing
leave me alone - I was only singing, leave me alone
you have just proved (again)
MOST PEOPLE KEEP THEIR BRAINS BETWEEN THEIR LEGS

 

I KNOW IT'S GONNA HAPPEN SOMEDAY

My love, wherever you are 
Whatever you are 
Don't lose faith 
I know it's gonna happen someday 
To you 
Please wait ... 
Please wait ... 
Oh ... Wait ... 
Don't lose faith 
You say that the day just never arrives 
And it's never seemed so far away 
Still, I know it's gonna happen someday 
To you 
Please wait ... 
Don't lose faith

 

WE'LL LET YOU KNOW

How sad are we ? 
And how sad have we been ? 
We'll let you know, We'll let you know 
Oh, but only if - you're really interested 
You wonder how 
We've stayed alive 'till now 
We'll let you know, We'll let you know 
But only if - you're really interested 
We're all smiles 
Then, honest, I swear, it's the turnstiles 
That make us hostile 
Oh ... We will descend 
On anyone unable to defend 
Themselves 
Oh ... And the songs we sing 
They're not supposed to mean a thing 
La, la, la, la ... Oh ...
You're lonely, Oh ... you're lonely 
Oh ... 
GET OFF THE ROOF !
Oh ... Your Arsenal !
We may seem cold, or 
We may even be 
The most depressing people you've ever known 
At heart, what's left, we sadly know 
That we are the last truly British people you'll ever know 
We are the last truly British people you will ever know 
You'll never never want to know

 

SUEDHEAD

Why do you come here
why do you hang around
I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry
Why do you come here
when you know it makes
things hard for me
when you know, oh
why do you come?
Why do you telephone?
and why send me silly notes?
I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry
why do you come here
when you know it makes
thing hard for me
when you know, oh
why do you come?
You had to sneak into my room
'just' to read my diary
was it just to see all the things
you knew I'd written about you?
and...so many illustrations
I'm so very sickened
oh, I am so sickened NOW

 

HE KNOWS I'D LOVE TO SEE HIM

He Knows (he knows)
Or, I think he does
because when I lived
in the Arse of the world...
he knows, he knows, he knows I'd love
to see him happy (or as close as is allowed)
because when I lived
in the Arse of the world
he knows, he knows, he knows I'd love
to see him happy (or as close as possible
as close as possible, as close as is allowed)
My name still conjours up deadly deeds
and a bad taste in the mouth
the police - they actually knew me
they said:
"You're just another person in the world
you're just another fool with radical views
you're just another who has maddening views
you want to turn it on its head
by staying in bed!"
I said: "I know I do"

 

YOU'RE GONNA NEED SOMEONE ON YOUR SIDE

With the world's fate 
Resting on your shoulder 
You're gonna need 
Someone on your side 
You can't do it by yourself 
Any longer 
You're gonna need 
Someone on your side 
Someone kindly told me 
That you'd wasted 
Eight of nine lives
Oh, give yourself a break 
Before you break down 
You're gonna need someone on your side 
And here I am, And here I am 
Well, you don't need 
To look so pleased ! 
Day or night, 
There is no difference 
You're gonna need someone on your side 
Day or night, 
There is no difference 
You're gonna need someone soon 
And here I am, And here I am 
Well, you don't need 
To look so pleased

 

GLAMOROUS GLUE

First day with the jar 
You find 
Everyone lies 
First day with the jar 
You find 
Everyone lies, nobody minds, Everyone lies 
Where is the man you respect ? 
And where is the woman you love ? 
Where's the woman you love ? 
Third week with the jar
You find 
Everything dies 
We won't vote Conservative 
Because we never have 
Everyone lies, everyone lies 
Where is the man you respect ? 
And where is the woman you love ? 
Where's the woman you love ? 
Everything of worth 
On Earth, Is there, To share 
I used to dream, and I used to vow 
I wouldn't dream of it now 
We look to Los Angeles 
For the language we use 
London is dead, London is dead, London is dead, ...
Now I'm too much in love 
I'm too much in love, 
I know I'll go 
Empty hand 
From the land

 

WE HATE IT WHEN OUR FRIENDS BECOME SUCCESSFUL

We hate it when our friends become successful 
We hate it when our friends become successful 
Oh, look at those clothes 
Now look at that face, it's so old 
And such a video ! 
Well, it's really laughable 
Ha, ha, ha ...
We hate it when our friends become successful 
And if they're Northern, that makes it even worse
And if we can destroy them 
You bet your life we will 
Destroy them 
If we can hurt them 
Well, we may as well ... 
It's really laughable 
Ha, ha, ha ... 
You see, it should've been me 
It could've been me 
Everybody knows 
Everybody says so 
They say : 
"Ah, you have loads of songs 
So many songs 
More songs than they'd stand 
Verse 
Chorus 
Middle eight 
Break, fade 
Just listen ..."
La, la-la, la-la

 

NOW MY HEART IS FULL

There's gonna be some trouble 
A whole house will need re-building 
And everyone I love in the house 
Will recline on an analyst's couch quite 
Soon 
Your Father cracks a joke 
And in the usual way 
Empties the room 
Tell all of my friends 
(I don't have too many 
Just some rain-coated lovers' puny brothers)
Dallow, Spicer, Pinkie, Cubitt 
Rush to danger 
Wind up nowhere 
Patric Doonan - raised to wait 
I'm tired again, I've tried again, and 
Now my heart is full 
Now my heart is full 
And I just can't explain 
So I won't even try to
Dallow, Spicer, Pinkie, Cubitt 
Every jammy Stressford poet 
Loafing oafs in all-night chemists 
Loafing oafs in all-night chemists 
Underact - express depression 
Ah, but Bunnie I loved you 
I was tired again 
I've tried again, and 
Now my heart is full 
Now my heart is full 
And I just can't explain 
So I won't even try to 
Could you pass by ? 
Could you pass by ? 
Oh ... 
Now my heart is full 
Now my heart is full 
And I just can't explain 
So ... slow ... 
Slow ... slow ... slow ... slow ... slow ...

 

SPRING-HEELED JIM

Spring-heeled Jim winks an eye 
He'll "do", he'll never be "done to" 
He takes on whoever flew through 
"Well, it's the normal thing to do" ... ah ... 
Spring-heeled Jim lives to love 
Now kissing with his mouth full 
And his eyes on some other fool 
So many women 
His head should be spinning 
Ah, but no ! 
Ah, but no ! 
But no !
Ah, no !
Spring-heeled Jim slurs the words : 
"There's no need to be so knowing
Take life at five times the 
Average speed, like I do" 
Until Jim feels the chill 
"Oh, where did all the time go ?" 
Once always in for the kill 
Now it's too cold 
And he feels too 
old 
Too old
Mmm, old... 
La, la, la, la-la, la ...

 

BILLY BUDD

Say, Billy Budd 
So you think you should ? 
Oh, everyone's laughing 
Say, Billy Budd 
So you think that you should ? 
Everyone's laughing ! 
Since I took up with you 
Things have been bad 
Yeah, but now it's 12 years on 
Now it's 12 years on 
Yes, and I took up with you 
I took my job application 
Into town 
Did you hear ? They turned me down 
Yes, and it's all because of us 
Oh, and what was in our eyes 
Oh, what was in our eyes, yeah 
I said, Billy Budd 
I would happily lose 
Both of my legs 
I would lose both of my legs 
Oh, if it meant you could be free 
Oh, if it meant you could be free 
(Don't leave us in the dark!)

 

HOLD ON TO YOUR FRIENDS

A bond of trust 
Has been abused 
Something of value 
May be lost 
Give up your job 
Squander your cash - be rash 
Just hold on to your friends 
There are more than enough 
To fight and oppose 
Why waste good time 
Fighting the people you like 
Who will fall defending your name 
Oh, don't feel so ashamed 
To have friends 
But now you only call me 
When you're feeling depressed 
When you feel happy I'm 
So far from your mind 
My patience is stretched 
My loyalty vexed 
Oh, you're losing all of your friends 
Hold on to your friends 
Hold on to your friends 
Resist - or move on 
Be mad, be rash 
Smoke and explode 
Sell all of your clothes 
Just bear in mind : 
Oh, there just might come a time 
When you need some friends

 

THE MORE YOU IGNORE ME, THE CLOSER I GET

The more you ignore me 
The closer I get 
You're wasting your time 
The more you ignore me 
The closer I get 
You're wasting your time 
I will be 
In the bar 
With my head 
On the bar 
I am now 
A central part 
Of your mind's landscape 
Whether you care 
Or do not 
Yeah, I've made up your mind 
The more you ignore me 
The closer I get 
You're wasting your time 
The more you ignore me 
The closer I get 
You're wasting your time 
Beware !
I bear more grudges 
Than lonely high court judges 
When you sleep 
I will creep 
Into your thoughts 
Like a bad debt 
That you can't pay 
Take the easy way 
And give in 
Yeah, and let me in 
Oh, let me in 
Oh let me ... 
Oh, let me in 
IT'S WAR 
IT'S WAR 
WAR 
WAR 
Oh, let me in 
Ah, the closer I get 
Ah, you're asking for it 
Ah, the closer I get 
Ooh, the closer I ...

 

WHY DON'T YOU FIND OUT FOR YOURSELF

The sanest days are mad 
Why don't you find out for yourself ? 
Then you'll see the price 
Very closely 
Some men here 
They have a special interest 
In your career 
They wanna help you to grow 
And then syphon all your dough 
Why don't you find out for yourself ? 
Then you'll see the glass 
Hidden in the grass 
You'll never believe me, so 
Why don't you find out for yourself ? 
Sick down to my heart 
That's just the way it goes 
Some men here 
They know the full extent of 
Your distress 
They kneel and pray 
And they say : 
"Long may it last" 
Why don't you find out for yourself ?
Then you'll see the glass 
Hidden in the grass 
Bad scenes come and go 
For which you must allow 
Sick down to my heart 
That's just the way it goes 
Don't rake up my mistakes 
I know exactly what they are 
And ... what do YOU do ? 
Well ... you just SIT THERE 
I've been stabbed in the back 
So many many times 
I don't have any skin 
But that's just the way it goes

 

I AM HATED FOR LOVING

I am hated for loving 
I am hated for loving 
Anonymous call, a poison pen 
A brick in the small of the back again 
I still don't belong 
To anyone - I am mine 
And I am hated for loving 
I am haunted for wanting 
Anonymous call, a poison pen 
A brick in the ... ah ... 
A brick in the small of the back again 
I still don't belong 
To anyone - I am mine 
I am falling 
With no-one to catch me 
I am falling 
And there's still 
No-one to catch me 
Ah .. 
Anonymous call, a poison pen 
A brick in the ... ah ... 
A brick in the small of the back again 
I just don't belong 
To anywhere 
I just don't belong 
Mmm ... 
Ah ...

 

LIFEGUARD SLEEPING, GIRL DROWNING

Always looking for attention 
Always needs to be mentioned 
Who does she 
Think she should be ? 
The shrill cry through darkening air 
Doesn't she know he's 
Had such a busy day ? 
Tell her ... sshhh
Somebody tell her ... sshhh 
Slowest ... 
It was only a test 
But she swam too far 
Against the tide 
She deserves all she gets 
The sky became marked with stars 
As an out-stretched arm slowly 
Disappears 
Hooray 
Oh hooray 
No, oh, oh, woh, there's no movement 
No, oh, hooray 
Oh, hooray 
Please don't worry 
There'll be no fuss 
She was ... nobody's nothing 
(What's your name ?) 
When he awoke 
The sea was calm 
And another day passes like a dream 
There's no ... no way 
(What's your name ?)

 

USED TO BE A SWEET BOY

Used to be a sweet boy 
Holding so tightly 
To Daddy's hand 
But that was all 
In some distant land 
Blazer and tie 
And a big bright healthy smile 
Used to make all 
Of our trials worthwhile 
Used to be a sweet boy 
And I'm not to blame 
Something went wrong 
And I know 
I'm not to blame 
Something went wrong 
Can't be to blame 
Ah ...

 

THE LAZY SUNBATHERS

A world war 
Was announced 
Days ago 
But they didn't know 
The lazy sunbathers 
The lazy sunbathers 
The sun burns through 
To the planet's core 
And it isn't enough 
They want more 
Nothing 
Appears 
To be 
Between the ears of 
The lazy sunbathers 
Too jaded 
To question stagnation 
The sun burns through 
To the planet's core 
And it isn't enough 
They want more 
Religions fall 
Children shelled 
"...Children shelled ? That's all 
Very well, but would you 
Please keep the noise 
Down low ? 
Because you're waking 
The lazy sunbathers ..."
Oh, the lazy sunbathers 
The lazy sunbathers

 

SPEEDWAY

And when you slam 
Down the hammer 
Can you see it in your heart ? 
All of the rumours 
Keeping me grounded 
I never said, I never said that they were 
Completely unfounded 
So when you slam 
Down the hammer 
Can you see it in your heart ? 
Can you delve so low ? 
And when you're standing 
On my fingers 
Can you see it in your heart ? ... ah ... 
And when you try 
To break my spirit 
It won't work 
Because there's nothing left to break 
Anymore 
All of the rumours 
Keeping me grounded 
I never said, I never said that they were 
Completely unfounded 
You won't sleep 
Until the earth that wants me 
Finally has me 
Oh you've done it now 
You won't rest 
Until the hearse that becomes me 
Finally takes me 
Oh you've done it now 
And you won't smile 
Until my loving mouth 
Is shut good and proper 
FOREVER 
All of the rumours 
Keeping me grounded 
I never said, I never said that they were 
Completely unfounded 
And all those lies 
Written lies, twisted lies 
Well, they weren't lies 
They weren't lies 
They weren't lies 
I never said 
I never said 
I could have mentioned your name 
I could have dragged you in 
Guilt by implication 
By association 
I've always been true to you 
In my own strange way 
I've always been true to you 
In my own sick way 
I'll always stay true to you

 

THE TEACHERS ARE AFRAID OF THE PUPILS

There's too many people 
Planning your downfall 
When your spirit's on trial 
These nights can be frightening 
Sleep transports sadness 
To some other mid-brain 
And somebody here 
Will not be here next year 
So you stand by the board 
Full of fear and intention 
And, if you think that they're listening 
Well, you've got to be joking 
Oh, you understand change 
And you think it's essential 
But when your profession 
Is humiliation 
Say the wrong word to our children ...
We'll have you, oh yes, we'll have you 
Lay a hand on our children 
And it's never too late to have you 
Mucus on your collar 
A nail up through the staff chair 
A blade in your soap 
And you cry into your pillow 
To be finished would be a relief 
To be finished would be a relief... 
Say the wrong word to our children ...
We'll have you, oh yes, we'll have you 
Lay a hand on our children 
And it's never too late to have you 
To be finished would be a relief 
To be finished would be a relief...
I'm very glad this thing has come 
Sometimes I'm so glad 
Never bother to play the tunes 
I've seen it coming for dear life

 

READER MEET AUTHOR

You don't know a thing about their lives 
They live where you wouldn't dare to drive
You shake as you think of how they sleep 
But you write as if you are my side-by-side 
Reader, meet Author 
With the hope of hearing sense 
But you may be feeling let down 
By the words of defence 
He says : "No-one ever sees me when I cry"
You don't know a thing about their lives 
Books don't save them, books aren't Stanley knives 
And if a fight broke out here tonight 
You'd be the first away, because you're that type 
And the Year 2000 won't change anyone here 
As each fabled promise flies so fast 
You'll swear it was never there 
Oh, have you ever escaped from a shipwrecked life ? 
So safely with your software; all miles from the front line 
You hear the way their sad voices, and you start to imagine things 
Oh, any excuse to write more lies

He's just too good-natured and 
He's got too much money and

THE OPERATION

You fight with your right hand 
And caress with your left hand 
Everyone I know is sick to death of you 
With a tear that's a mile wide 
In the kite that you're flying 
Everyone I know is sick to death of you 
Ever since 
You don't look the same 
You're just not the same, no way 
You say clever things and 
You never used to 
You don't catch what I'm saying 
When you're deafened to advice 
Everyone here is sick to the 
Back teeth of you 
With a tear that's a mile wide 
In the kite that you're flying 
Everyone here is sick to the 
Tattoo of you 
Ever since 
You don't look the same 
You're just not the same, no way 
You say pleasant things and 
There is no need to
Still, you fight with your right hand 
And caress with your left hand 
Ooh, ooh ... Sad to say ... 
How once I was in love with you 
Sad to say ... 
You don't catch what I'm saying 
When you're deafened to advice 
Ooh, ooh ... Ever since 
You don't look the same 
You're just not the same, no way 
What the hell have 
They stuck into you ?

 

DAGENHAM DAVE

Head in the clouds, and a mouthful of pie 
Head in a blouse, everybody loves him 
I see why 
Dagenham Dave, Dagenham Dave, Oh, Dagenham Dave 
Dagenham Dave, Dagenham Dave, Oh, Dagenham Dave 
"I love Karen, I love Sharon" on the windowscreen 
With never the need to fight or to question a single thing 
Dagenham Dave, Dagenham Dave Oh, Dagenham Dave 
Dagenham Dave, Dagenham Dave Oh, Dagenham Dave ...
He'd love to touch, he's afraid that he might self-combust 
I could say more, but you get the general idea 
Dagenham Dave, Dagenham Dave Dagenham Dave, Dagenham Dave 
Dagenham, Dagenham Dagenham Dave, Dagenham Dave ...
Oh, Dave, oh, Dagenham, dagenham, Oh, Dave, oh, Dave, ...

 

DO YOUR BEST AND DON'T WORRY

Compare the best of their days 
With the worst of your days 
You won't win 
With your standards so high 
And your spirits so low 
At least remember ... 
This is you on a bad day, you on a pale day 
Just do your best and don't ... Don't worry, oh 
The way you hang yourself is oh, so unfair 
See the best of how they look 
Against the worst of how you are
And again, you won't win 
With your standards so high 
And your spirits so low 
At least remember ... 
This is you on a drab day, you in a drab dress 
Just do your best and don't ... Don't worry, oh 
The way you hang yourself is oh, so unfair 
Just do your best and don't ... Don't worry, oh 
The way you watch yourself is oh, so unfair 
Just do your best and don't ... Don't worry, oh 
Do your best and don't ...

SOUTHPAW

You were a boy before you became a man 
I don't see the joy 
And you ran with your pals in the sun 
You turned around and they were gone 
Again ... 
A sick boy should be treated 
So easily defeated 
Oh, I just don't understand 
So you ran with your pals in the sun 
You turned around 
You were alone 
Again ... 
And you ran back to Ma 
Which set the pace for the rest of your days 
Oh, you ran back to Ma 
Which set the pace for the rest of your days 
Oh, you ran back to Ma 
Which set the pace for the rest of your days 
And now, there is something that you should know 
There is something that you should know 
The girl of your dreams is 
Here all alone 
Girl of your dreams is 
Here all alone 
The girl of your dreams is 
Sad and all alone 
The girl of your dreams is 
Here all alone 
There is something that you should know

Girl of your dreams is 
Here all alone 
The girl of your dreams is 
Sad and is all alone 
The girl of your dreams is 
Sad and is feeling all alone 
Oh, there is something that you should know 
Help me, help me, help me ...

 

MALADJUSTED

I wanna start from 
Before the beginning 
Loot wine, "Be mine, and 
Then let's stay out for the night"
Ride via Parkside 
Semi-perilous lives 
Jeer the lights in the windows 
Of all safe and stable homes 
(But wondering then, well what 
Could peace of mind be like ?)
Anyway do you want to hear 
Our story, or not ? 
As the Fulham Road lights 
Stretch and invite into the night 
From a Stevenage overspill 
We'd kill to live around 
SW6 - with someone like you 
Keep thieves' hours 
With someone like you 
...As long as it slides 
You stalk the house 
In a low-cut blouse : 
"Oh Christ, another stifled 
Friday night !"
And the Fulham Road lights 
Stretch and invite into the night 
Well, I was fifteen 
What could I know ?
When the gulf between 
All the things I need 
And the things I receive 
Is an ancient ocean 
Wide, wild, lost, uncrossed 
Still I maintain there's nothing 
Wrong with you 
You do all that you do 
Because it's all you can do 
Well, I was fifteen 
Where could I go ?
With a soul full of loathing 
For stinging bureaucracy 
Making it anything 
Other than easy 
For working girls like me 
With my hands on my head 
I flop on your bed 
With a head full of dread 
For all I've ever said 
Maladjusted, maladjusted 
Maladjusted maladjusted 
Never to be trusted 
Oh, never to be trusted 
There's nothing wrong with you, oh 
...There's nothing wrong with you

 

ALMA MATTERS

So : the choice I have made 
May seem strange to you 
But who asked you, anyway ? 
It's my life to wreck 
My own way 
You see : to someone, somewhere, oh yeah ... 
Alma matters 
In mind, body and soul 
In part, and in whole 
Because to someone, somewhere, oh yeah ... 
Alma matters 
In mind, body and soul 
In part, and in whole 
So the life I have made 
May seem wrong to you 
But, I've never been surer 
It's my life to ruin 
My own way 
You see : to someone, somewhere, oh yeah ... 
Alma matters 
In mind, body and soul 
In part, and in whole 
Because to someone, somewhere, oh yeah ... 
Alma matters 
In mind, body and soul 
In part, and in whole 
To someone, somewhere, oh yeah ... 
Alma matters 
In mind, body and soul 
Part, and in whole 
So to someone, somewhere, oh yeah ... 
Alma matters 
In mind, body and soul 
Part, and in whole 
To someone, somewhere, oh yeah ... 
Oh yeah ... Oh yeah, oh yeah Oh yeah ...

 

AMBITIOUS OUTSIDERS

Bolt-lock your doors 
Alarm your cars 
And still we move in closer 
Every day 
Top of the list 
Is your smiling kids 
But we'll be smiling too 
So that's OK 
Oh, and by the way 
Thank you, because you're 
Giving, giving, giving 
And we're receiving - 
No, no, we're taking 
Keeping the population down 
Your taxes paid, but 
Police waylaid 
And we knows 
When the school bus 
Comes and goes 
We're on your street, but 
You don't see us 
Or, if you do 
You smile and say Hello 
BUT DON'T UNDERESTIMATE US 
When you are 
Giving, giving, giving 
And we're receiving - 
No, no, we're taking 
Just keeping 
The population down 
You're giving, giving, giving 
Well, it's your own fault 
For reproducing 
We're just keeping 
The population down

 

TROUBLE LOVES ME

Trouble loves me 
Trouble needs me 
Two things 
More than you do 
Or would attempt to 
So, console me 
Otherwise, hold me 
Just when it seems like 
Everything's evened out 
And the balance 
Seems serene 
Trouble loves me 
Walks beside me 
To chide me 
Not to guide me 
It's still much more 
Than you'll do 
So, console me 
Otherwise, hold me 
Just when it seems like 
Everything's evened out 
And the balance seems serene 
See the fool I'll be 
Still running 'round 
On the flesh rampage 
Still running 'round 
Ready with ready-wit 
Still running 'round 
On the flesh rampage 
- At your age ! 
Go to Soho, oh 
Go to waste in 
The wrong arms 
Still running 'round 
Trouble loves me 
Seeks and finds me 
To charlatanize me 
Which is only 
As it should be 
Oh, please fulfill me 
Otherwise, kill me 
Show me a barrel and watch me scrape it 
Faced with the music, as always I'll face it 
In the half-light 
So English, frowning 
Then at midnight I 
Can't get you out of my head 
A disenchanted taste 
Still running 'round 
A disenchanted taste 
Still running 'round

 

PAPA JACK

Papa Jack 
Wants to turn 
Back the clock 
And reach out 
To the kids 
He once had 
Who have flown 
Papa Jack 
In decline 
Feels inclined 
To reach out 
To the kids 
He once had 
Who have flown 
But there was a time 
When the kids reached up 
And Papa Jack just 
Pushed them away 
Looking deep 
In his heart 
Papa Jack 
Doesn't like 
What he sees 
Or the time 
On his hands 
The dying day 
The chilly sun 
Papa Jack 
All alone 
Sings slow 
Grieving and low 
But there was a time 
When the kids reached up 
Now you can't always 
Have it your way 
Papa Jack 
Ah ...

 

AMMUNITION

I know these roads 
Each ridge 
And narrow bridge 
Each cheveron 
Enticing me on 
Each warning sign 
I take in my stride 
I don't need more ammunition 
I've got more than I can spend 
I don't dwell on things I'm missing 
I'm just pleased 
With the things I've found 
I know these roads 
An old hand understands 
Above all, I know what's 
Expected of me now 
Veering cliffwards 
I don't need more ammunition 
I've got more than I can spend 
I don't dwell on things I'm missing 
I'm just pleased 
With the things I've found 
With the things I've found 
With the things I've found 
I've found 
I've been crying 
It comes back on these salient days 
And it stays 
And it says : 
"We've never really been away" 
I don't need more ammunition 
I've got more than I can spend 
I don't think of who I'm missing 
I've got no space and no time 
In my life, anymore 
No space or time 
In my life, anymore 
For Revenge

 

WIDE TO RECEIVE

Download something 
Useful, or useless 
Because I'm lying here 
Wide to receive 
Almost anything 
You'd care to give 
And I don't 
Get along with myself 
And I'm not too keen 
On anyone else 
Turn on, plug in 
Then just walk away 
Unlock, process 
And then just go 
And I've never felt quite so alone 
As I do right now 
I'm lying here 
Wide to receive 
Almost anything 
You'd care to leave 
Wide, wide, wide Wide, wide, wide...

 

ROY'S KEEN

(GO ON !)
He's romancing you 
And chancing his arm 
He'll be here 
Smiling on time 
He's romancing you 
And chancing his arm 
He'll be here 
Smiling on time 
Roy's keen oh Roy's keen 
Roy's keen oh Roy's keen 
We've never seen a 
Keener window-cleaner 
Back up the ladder 
Into each corner 
Dunking the chamois 
Just think of the goodwill 
The ladder's a planet 
Roy is a star, and 
I am a satellite 
(But that's alright) 
He can hold a smile for as long 
As you require (even longer) 
He can hold a smile for as long 
As you require (even longer) 
Roy's keen oh Roy's keen 
Roy's keen oh Roy's keen 
We've never seen a 
Keener window-cleaner 
Back up the ladder 
Into each corner 
Dunking the chamois 
Just think of the goodwill 
The ladder's a planet 
Roy is a star, and 
I am a satellite 
I will be set alight 
Don't say you'll hold it steady 
Then you let it go 
Don't say you'll hold it steady 
Then you let it go Oh ...
You're up the ladder 
Into each corner 
Foot in a bucket 
We trust you to wreck it 
Even when it's under your nose 
Well, you just can't 
See it, can you ? 
Well, it's here 
Right under your nose 
And you just can't 
See it, can you? La la la la ...
Roy's keen, Roy's keen La la la la ...
We've never seen a 
Keener window-cleaner 
Oh ... La la la la ...

 

HE CRIED

I need you 
Simple words 
But words which had never been heard 
By the soul 
Stoned to death 
But still living 
And so he froze where he stood 
And he looked to the ground 
And he cried 
He cried 
Ride our minds 
If you must 
But there's always a line you don't cross 
Time is short 
Don't be cruel 
Oh you don't know the power 
In what you're saying 
Oh ... 
And so he froze where he stood 
And he looked to the ground 
And he cried 
He cried 
People where 
I come from 
They survive without feelings or blood 
I never could 
Was stoned to death 
But I'm still living 
So he froze where he stood 
And he looked to the ground 
And he cried 
He cried 
So he froze 
And he looked, and he looked 
To the ground 
And he cried 
He cried

 

SORROW WILL COME IN THE END

Legalized theft 
Leaves me bereft 
I get it straight in the neck 
(Somehow expecting no less) 
A court of justice 
With no use for Truth 
Lawyer ...liar 
Lawyer ...liar 
You pleaded and squealed 
And you think you've won 
But Sorrow will come 
To you in the end 
And as sure as my words are pure 
I praise the day that brings you pain 
Q.C.'s obsessed with sleaze 
Frantic for Fame 
They're all on the game 
They just use a different name 
You lied 
And you were believed 
By a J.P. senile and vile 
You pleaded and squealed 
And you think you've won 
But Sorrow will come 
To you in the end 
And as sure as my words are pure 
I praise the day that brings you pain 
So don't close your eyes 
Don't close your eyes 
A man who slits throats 
Has time on his hands 
And I'm gonna get you 
So don't close your eyes 
Don't ever close your eyes 
You think you've won 
OH NO

 

SATAN REJECTED MY SOUL

Satan rejected my soul 
He knows my kind 
He won't be dragged down 
He's seen my face around 
He knows Heaven doesn't seem 
To be my home 
So I must find 
Somewhere else to go 
So I must find 
Somewhere else to go 
So, take it - please 
It's free 
You'll never see 
You'll never see 
All the fun in life it's cost me 
Satan rejected my soul 
As low as he goes 
He never quite goes this low 
He's seen my face around 
He knows Heaven doesn't seem 
To be my home 
So I must find 
Somewhere else to go 
So I must find 
Somewhere else to go 
So, take it please 
It's really sly 
Come on, come on, ah Come on, come on, come on 
Take it please, It's really sly 
Come on, come on, ah Come on, come on, come on 
Call me in, Pull me in, call me in 
Come on, come on, oh Come on, come on, come on 
Pull me in, pull me in, Call me in, haul me in, pull me in 
Come on, come on, ah, Come on, come on 
La la la la la, Oh ...

 
 REEL AROUND THE FOUNTAIN

It's time the tale was told
of how you took a child
and you made him old
Reel around the fountain
slap me on the patio
I'll take it now
Fifteen minutes with you
well, I wouldn't say no
people said that you were virtually dead
and they were so wrong
fifteen minutes with you
well, i wouldn't say no
people said that you were easily led
and they were half-right
I dreamt about you last night
and i fell out of bed twice
you can pin and mount me like a butterfly
but take me to the haven of your bed
was something that you never said
two lumps, please
you're the bee's knees
but so am I
Meet me at the fountain
shove me on the patio
I'll take it slowly
Fifteen minutes with you
oh I wouldn't say no
people see no worth in you
oh but I do

 

YOU'VE GOT EVERYTHING NOW

As merry as the days were long
I was right and you were wrong
back at the old grey school
I would win and you would lose
But you've got everything now
and what a terrible mess I've made of my life
No, I've never had a job
because I've never wanted one
I've seen you smile
but I've never really heard you laugh
So who is rich and who is poor?
I cannot say...
You are your mother's only son
and you're a desperate one
But I don't want a lover
I just want to be seen in the back of your car
A friendship sadly lost?
Well, this is true ...and yet, it's false
Did I ever tell you , by the way
I never did like your face
But you've got everything now
and what a terrible mess I've made of my life
No, I've never had a job
because I'm too shy
But I don't want a lover
I just want to be tied to the back of your car.

 

MISERABLE LIE

So, goodbye
please stay with your own kind
and I'll stay with mine
There's something against us
it's not time
So, goodbye
I know I hardly say
how much I love your casual way
but please put your tongue away
a little higher and we're well away
the dark nights are drawing in
and your humour is as black as them
I look at yours, you laugh at mine
and"love" is just a miserable lie
you have destroyed my flower like-life
not once-but twice
you have corrupt my innocent mind
not once-but twice
I know that wind-swept mystical air
it means: I'd like to see your underwear
I recognise that mystical air
it means: I'd like to see your underwear
what do we get for the trouble and pain?
just a rented room in Whalley Range
into the depths of the criminal world
I followed her...
I need advice, I need advice
because nobody ever looks at me twice
I'm just a country-mile behind
the world
I'm just a country mile behind
the whole world
so take me when you go

 

PRETTY GIRLS MAKE GRAVES

Upon the sand,upon the bay
"there is a quick and easy way" you say
before you illustrate
I'd rather state:
"I'm not the man you think I am
I'm not the man you think I am "
And Sorrow's native son
he will not smile for anyone
And pretty girls makes the graves
End of the pier, end of the bay
you tug my arm and say:"Give into lust,
give up to lust, oh heaven knows we'll
soon be dust..."
But I'm not the man you think I am
I'm not the man you think I am
And Sorrow's native son
he will not rise for anyone
And pretty girls make graves
I could have been wild and I could have been free
but Nature played this trick on me
She wants it Now
and she will not wait
but she's too rough
and I'm too delicate
Then on the sand
another man, he takes her hand
and a smile lights up her stupid face
(and well, it would)
I lost my faith in Womanhood
I lost my faith in Womanhood, I lost my faith

 

THE HAND THAT ROCKS THE CRADLE

Please don't cry
the ghost and the storm outside
will not invade this sacred shire
nor infiltrate your mind
my life down I shall lie
if the bogey-man should try
to play tricks on your sacred mind
to tease, torment and tantalise
wavering shadows loom
a piano plays in an empty room
there'll be blood on the cleaver tonight
when darkness lifts and the room is bright
I'll still be by your side
for you are all that matters
and I'll love you till the day I die
there never need to be longing in your eyes
as long as the hand that rocks the cradle is mine
ceiling shadows shimmy by
and when the wardrobe towers like a beast of prey
there's a sadness in your beautiful eyes
you're untouched, unsoiled, wonderous eyes
my life down I shall lie
should restless spirts try
to play tricks on you sacred mind
but whom I never gave a name
I just looked into his wonderous eyes
and said" never never never again"
all too soon I did return
just like a moth to a flame
so rattle my bones all over the stones
because I'm only a beggar-man whom nobody owns
see how words as old as sin
fit me like a glove I'm here and here I'll stay
together we lie, together we pray
there never need be longing in your eyes
as long as the hand that rocks the cradle is mine

 

STILL ILL

I decree today that life
is simply taking and not giving
England is mine and it owes me a living
ask me why, and I'll spit in your eye
ask me why, and I'll spit in your eye
but we cannot cling to the old dreams anymore
no, we cannot cling to the old dreams anymore
Does the body rule the mind
or does the mind rule the body?
I dunno...
Under the iron bridge we kissed
and although I ended up with sore lips
it just wasn't like the old days anymore
no, it wasn't like those days
am I still ill?
Does the body rule the mind
or does the mind rule the body ?
I dunno...
Ask me why, and I'll die
ask me why, and I'll die
and if you must go to work tomorrow
well, if I were you I wouldn't bother
for there are brighter sides to life
and I should know because I've seen them
but not very often...
under the iron bridge we kissed
and although I ended up with sore lips
it just wasn't like the old days anymore
no, it wasn't like those days
am I still ill?

 

HAND IN GLOVE

Hand in glove
the sun shines out of our behinds
no, it's not like any other love
this one is different-because it's us
Hand in glove
we can go wherever we please
and everything depends upon
how near you stand to me
And if the people stare
then the people stare
I really don't know and I really don't care
Hand in glove
the Good People laugh
yes, we may be hidden by rags
but we have something they'll never have
So, hand in glove I stake my claim
I'll fight to the last breath
If they dare touch a hair on your head
I'll fight to the last breath
The Good Life is out there, somewhere
so stay on my arm, you little charmer
But I know my luck too well
and I'll probably never see you again.

 

WHAT DIFFERENCE DOES IT MAKE?

All men have secrets and here is mine
so let it be known
we have been through hell and high tide,
I can surely rely on you?
and yet you start to recoil,
heavy words are so lightly thrown
but still I'd leap in front of a flying bullet for you
So, what difference does it make?
so, what difference does it make?
it makes none
but you have gone
and you must be looking very old tonight
The devil will find work for idle hands to do
I stole and I lied, and why?
because you asked me to!
but now you make feel so ashamed
because I've only got two hands
well, I'm still fond of you
So, what difference does it make?
so, what difference does it make?
it makes none
but you have gone
and your prejudice won't keep you warm tonight
So, no more apologies
no more apologies
I'm too tired
I'm too sick and tired
and I'm feeling very sick and ill today
But I'm still fond of you

 

I DON'T OWE YOU ANYTHING

Bought on stolen wine
a nod was the first step
you know very well
what was coming next
did I really walk all this way
just to hear you say
"oh I don't want to go out tonight"
but you will
for you must
I don't owe you anything
but you owe me something
repay me now
you should never go to them
let them come to you
just like I do
you should not go to them
let them come to you
just like I do
Too freely on your lips
words prematurely said
oh but I know what will make you smile tonight
Life is never kind
life is never kind
oh but I know what will make you smile tonight

 

SUFFER LITTLE CHILDREN

Over the moors,take me to the moors
dig a shallow grave
and I'll lay me down
Lesley-Anne, with your pretty white beads
oh John, you'll never be a man
and you'll never see your home again
oh Manchester, so much to answer for
Edward, see those alluring lights?
tonight will be your very last night
a woman said "I know my son is dead
I'll never rest my hands on his scared head"
Hindley wakes and Hindley says:
"Wherever he has gone, I have gone "
But fresh lilaced moorland fields
cannot hide the stoild stench of death
Hindley wakes and Hindley says:
"Whatever he has done, I have done"
But this is no easy ride
for a child cries
"find me...find me, nothing more
we're on a sullen misty moor
we may be dead and we may be gone
but we will be right by your side
until the day you die
this is no easy ride
we will haunt you when you laugh
yes, you could say we're a team
you might sleep
BUT YOU WILL NEVER DREAM!"
Oh Manchester, so much to answer for
Oh Manchester, so much to answer for
Over the moor, I'm on the moor
the child is on the moor

 

THE HEADMASTER RITUAL

Belligerent ghouls
run Manchester schools
spineless swines
cemented mines
Sir leads the troops
jealous of youth
same old suit since 1962
he does the military two-step
down the nape of my neck
I wanna go home
I don't want to stay
give up education
is a bad mistake
mid-week on the playing fields
Sir thwacks you on the knees
knees you in the groin
elbow in the face
I wanna go home
I don't want to stay
Belligerent ghouls
run Manchester schools
spineless bastards all
Sir leads the troops
jealous of youth
same old jokes since 1902
he does the military two-step
down the nape of my neck
I wanna go home
I don't want to stay
give up life
as a bad mistake
please excuse me from gym
I've got this terrible cold coming on
he grabs and devours
he kicks me in the showers
kicks me in the showers
and he grabs and devours
I wanna go home
I don't want to stay

 

RUSHOLME RUFFIANS

The last night at the fair
by the big wheel generator
a boy is stabbed
and his money is grabbed
and the air hangs heavy like a dulling wine
she is famous
she is funny
an engagement ring
doesn't mean a thing
to a mind consumed by brass(money)
and though I walk home alone
my faith in love is still devout
the last night at the fair
from a seat on a whirling waltzer
her skirt ascends for a watching eye
it's a hideous trait( on her mother's side)
and though I walk home alone
my faith in love is still devout
then someone falls in love
and someone's beaten up
and the senses being dulled are mine
and someone falls in love
someone's beaten up
and the senses being dulled are mine
and though I walk home alone
my faith in love is still devout
this is the last night of the fair
and the grease in the hair
of a speedway operator
is all a tremulous heart requires
a schoolgirl is denied
she said "How quickly would I die
if I jumped from the top of the parachutes?"
this is the last night of the fair

scratch my name on your arm with a fountain pen

I WANT THE ONE I CAN'T HAVE

On the day that your mentality
catches up with your biology
I want the one I can't have
and it's driving me mad
it's written all over my face
A double-bed
and a stalwart lover, for sure
these are the riches of the poor
A double-bed
and a stalwart lover, for sure
these are the riches of the poor
a tough kid who sometimes swallows nails
raised on Prisoner's Aid
he killed a policeman when he was thirteen
and somehow that really impressed me
it's written all over my face
On the day that your mentality
catches up with your biology
And if you ever need self-validation
just meet me in the alley by the
railway-station
it's written all over my face

 

WHAT SHE SAID

What she said:
"How come someone hasn't noticed
that I'm dead
and decided to bury me
God knows, I'm ready"
What she said was
but then, all the rejection she's had
to pretend to be happy
could only be idiocy
What she said was not for the job or
lover that she never had
What she read
all heady books
she'd sit and prophesise
(it took a tattoed boy from Birkenhead
to really really open her eyes)

THAT JOKE ISN'T FUNNY ANYMORE

Park the car at the side of the road
you should know
time's tide will smother you
and I will too
when you laugh about other people who feel so
very lonely
their only desire is to die
well I'm afraid
it doesn't make me smile
I wish I could laugh
but that joke isn't funny anymore
it's too close to home and it's too near the bone
it's too close to home and it's too near the bone
more than you'll ever know
It was dark as I drove the point home
and on cold leather seats
well, it suddenly struck me
I just might die with a smile on my
face after all
I've seen this happen in other people's lives
and now it's happening in mine

 

NOWHERE FAST

I'd like to drop my trousers to the world
I am a man of means(of slender means)
each household appliance
is like a new science in my town
and if a day came when I felt a natural emotion
I'd get such a shock I'd probably jump in the ocean
and when a train goes by
it's such a sad sound
I'd like to drop my trousers to the Queen
every sensible child will know what this means
the poor and the needy
are selfish and greedy on her terms
and if the day came when I felt a natural emotion
I'd get such a shock I'd probably jump in the ocean
and when a train goes by
it's such a sad song
And when I'm lying in my bed
I think about life
and I think about death
and neither one particularly appeals to me
and if the day came when I felt a natural emotion
I'd get such a shock I'd probably lie
in the middle of the street and die
I'd lie down and die

 

WELL I WONDER

Well I wonder
do you hear me when you sleep?
I hoarsely cry
Well I wonder
do you see me when we pass?
I half-die
Please keep me in mind
please keep me in mind
Gasping-but somehow still alive
this is the fierce last stand of all I am
Gasping-dying-but somehow still alive
this is the final stand of all I am
Please keep me in mind

 

BARBARISM BEGINS AT HOME

Unruly boys
who will not grow up
must be taken in hand
Unruly girls
who will not settle down
they must be taken in hand
A crack on the head
is what you get for not asking
and a crack on the head
is what you get for asking

 

MEAT IS MURDER

Heifer whines could be human cries
closer comes the screaming knife
this beautiful creature must die
this beautiful creature must die
a death for no reason
and death for reason is MURDER
and the flesh you so fancifully fry
is not succulent, tasty or nice
it's death for no reason
and death for no reason is MURDER
and the calf that you carve with a smile
is MURDER
and the turkey you festively slice
is MURDER
do you know how animals die?
kitchen aroma aren't very homely
it's not "comforting," "cheery" or kind
it's sizzling blood and the unholy stench
of MURDER
it's not "natural," "normal" or kind
the fleas you so fancifully fry
as you savour the flavour
of MURDER
NO, NO, NO, IT'S MURDER
NO, NO, NO, IT'S MURDER
who hears when animals cry?

 

THE QUEEN IS DEAD

Farewell to this lands cheerless marches
hemmed in like a boar between arches
her very Lowness with her head in a sling
Im truely sorry-but it sounds like a wonderful thing
dear Charles, dont you ever crave
to appear on the front of the Daily mail
dressed in your Mother's bridal veil?
So, I checked all the registered historical facts
and I was shocked into shame to discover
how Im the 18th pale descendent
of some, old queen or other
has the world changed, or have I changed?
has the world changed, or have I changed?
as some 9-year old tough peddles drugs
(I never even knew what drugs were)
And so, I broke into the Palace
with a sponge and a rusty spanner
she said: "Eh, I know you, and you cannot sing"
I said: "that's nothing -you should hear me play piano"
We can go for a walk where it's quiet and dry
and we can talk about precious things
but when you are tied to your mother's apron
not one talks about castration
We can go for a walk where it's quiet and dry
and we can talk about precious things
like love and law and poverty
these are the things that kill me
We can go for a walk where it's quiet and dry
and we can talk about precious things
but the rain that flattens my hair
theses are the things that kill me
Passed the Pub that saps your body
and the church who'll snatch your money
the Queen is dead, boys
and it's so lonely on a limb
Pass the Pub that wrecks your body
and the church-all they want is your money
the Queen is dead, boys`
you can trust me, boys
life is very long, when you're lonely
life is very long, when you're lonely...

 

FRANKLY MR.SHANKLY

Frankly, Mr Shankly, this position Ive held
it pays my way, but it corrodes my soul
I want to leave you will not miss me
I want to go down in musical history
Frankly, Mr Shankly, Im a sickening wreck
Ive got the 21st Century breathing down my neck
I must move fast, you understand me
I want to go down in celluloid history
Fame, Fame, fatal Fame
it can play hideous tricks on the brain
but still I rather be Famous
than righteous or holy, any day
but sometimes Id feel more fulfilled
making Christmas cards with the mentally ill
I want to Live and I want to Love
I want to catch something that I might be ashamed of
Frankly, Mr Shankly, this position I've held
it pays my way and it corrodes my soul
oh, I didnt realise that you wrote poetry
(I didnt realise you wrote such bloody awful poetry)
Frankly, Mr Shankly, since you ask
you are a flatulent pain the arse
I do not mean to be so rude
but still, I must speck frankly, Mr Shankly

 

I KNOW IT'S ALL OVER

Oh Mother, I can fell the soil falling over my head
and as i climb into an empty bed
Oh well, Enough said
I know it's over-still I cling
I don't know where else I can go
Oh Mother, I can feel the soil falling over my head
see, the sea want s to take me
the knife wants to cut me
do you think you can help me?
Sad veiled bride, please be happy
handsome groom, give her room
loud, loutish lover, treat her kindly
(although she needs you
more than she loves you)
and I know it's over
and it never really began
but in my heart it was so real
and you even spoke to me and said:
"If you're so funny
then why are you on your own tonight?
and if you are so clever
then why are you on your own tonight?
if you're so terribly good looking
then why do you sleep alone tonight?
because tonight is just like any other night
that's why you're on your own tonight
with your triumphs and your charms
while they are in each other's arms.."
It's so easy to laugh
it's so easy to hate
it takes strength to be gentle and kind
It's so easy to laugh
it's so easy to hate
it takes guts to be gentle and kind
love is Natural and Real
but not for you, my love
not tonight my love
love is Natural and Real
but not for such as you and I, my love
Oh Mother, I can fell the soil falling over my head
Oh Mother, I can fell the soil falling over my head...

 

NEVER HAD NO ONE EVER

When you walk without ease
on these
the very streets where you were raised
I had a really bad dream
it lasted 20 years, 7 months, and 27 days
Never had no one ever.

 

CEMETERY GATES

A dreaded sunny day
so I meet you at the cemetry gates
Keats and Yeats are on your side
A dreaded sunny day
so I meet you at the cemetry gates
Keats and Yeats are on your side
while Wilde is on mine
So we go inside and we gravely read the stones
all those people all those lives
where are they now ?
with loves, and hates
and passions just like mine
they were born
and then they lived and then they died
which seems so unfair
and I wantr to crv
You say: "ere thrice the sun hath done salutation to the dawn"
and you claim these words as your own
but Im well-read, have heard them said
a hundred times (maybe less, maybe more)
if you must write prose/poems
the words you use should be your own
dont plagiarise or take "on loans"
there's alweays someone, somewhere
with a big nose, who knows
and who trips you up and laughs
when you fall
You say: "ere long done do does did "
words which could only be your own
you then produce the text
from whence was ripped
(some dizzy whore, 1804)
A dreaded sunny day
so let's go where we're happy
so I meet you at the cemetry gates
Keats and Yeats are on your side
A dreaded sunny day
so let's go where we're wanted
so I meet you at the cemetry gates
Keats and Yeats are on your side
but you lose
because Wilde is on mine

 

BIGMOUTH STRIKES AGAIN

Sweetness, sweetness I was only joking
when I said Id like to smash every tooth
in your head
Sweetness, sweetness I was only joking
when I said by right s you should be
bludgeoned in your bed
and now I know how Joan of Arc felt
now I know how Joan of Arc felt
as the flames roseto her roman nose
and her Walkman stared to melt
Bibmouth, bigmouth
bigmouth strikes again
and Ive got no right to take my place
with the Human race
and now I know how Joan of Arc felt
now I know of Joan of Arc felt
as the flames rose to her roman nose
and her hearing aid started to melt
Bigmouth, bigmouth
bigmouth strikes again
and Ive got no right to take my place
with the Human race

 

THE BOY WITH A THORN IN HIS SIDE

The boy with the thorn in his side
behind the hatred there lies
a murderous desire for love
how can they look into my eyes
and still they dont believe me
how can they hear me say those words
and still they dont believe me
and if they don't believe me now
will they ever believe me?
and if they don't believe me now
will they ever believe me?
The boy with the thorn in his side
behind the hatred there lies
a plundering desire for love
how can they see the Love in our eyes
and still they don't believe us
and after all this time
they don't want to believe us
and if they dont believe us now
will they ever believe us ?
andd when you want to Live
how do you start ?
where do you go ?
who do you know?

 

VICAR IN A TUTU

I was minding mind business
lifting some lead off
the roof of the Holy Name church
it was worthwhile living a laughable life
just to set my eyes on a blistering sight
of a vicar in a tu-tu
he's not strange
he just wants to live his life this way
a scanty bit of a thing
with a decorative ring
that wouldn't cover the head of a child
as Rose collects the money in the cannister
who comes sliding down the bannister
the vicar in a tu-tu
he's not strange
he just wants to live his life this way
the monkish monsignor
with a head full of plaster
said "my man, get your vile soul dry-cleaned"
as Rose counts the money in the cannister
as natural as rain
he dances again
vicar in a tu-tu
The next day in the pulpit
with Freedom and Ease
combating ignoranca,dust and disease
as Rose counts the money in the cannister
as natural as rain
he dances again
the fabric of a tu-tu
any man could get us to
and I am a living sign.

 

THERE IS A LIGHT THAT NEVER GOES OUT

Take me out tonight
where there's music and there's people
who are young and alive
driving in your car
I never never want to go home
because I havent got one
anymore
take me out tonight
because I want to see people and I
want to see lights
driving in your car
oh please dont drop me home
because it's not my home, it's their
home, and Im welcome no morw
and if a double-decker bus
crashes in to us
to die by your side
such a heavenly way to die
and if a ten ton truck
kills the both of us
to die by your side
the pleasure and the privilege is mine
take me out tonight
oh take me anywhere, I dont care
and in the darken underpass
I thought Oh God, my chance has come at last
(but then a strange fear gripped me and I just couldn't ask)
take me out tonight
take me anywhere, I dont care
just driving in your car
I never never want to go home
because I havent got one
I havent got one.

 

SOME GIRLS ARE BIGGER THAN OTHERS

From the ice-age to the dole-age
there is but one concern
and I have just discover
some girls are bigger than others
some girls are bigger than others
some girls mothers are bigger than
other girls mothers
As Anthony said to Cleopatra
as he opened a crate of ale:
some girls are bigger than others
some girls are bigger than others
some girls mothers are bigger than
other girls mothers.

 

A RUSH AND A PUSH AND AND THE LAND IS OURS

HELLO
I am the ghost of Troubled Joe
hung by his pretty white neck
some eighteen months ago
I travelled to a mystical time zone
but I missed my bed
so I soon came home
they said:
"there's too much caffeine
in your bloodstream
and a lack of real spice
in your life"
I said:
"leave me alone
because I'm alright, dad
just surprised to still
be on my own...."
Ooh, but don't mention love
I'd hate the real strain of the pain again
a rush and a push and the land that
we stand on is ours
it has been before
so it shall be again
and people who are uglier than you and I
they take what they need, and leave
Ooh, but don't mention love
I'd hate the pain and the strain all over again
a rush and a push and the land that
we stand on is ours
it has been before
so why can't it be now?
and people who are weaker than you and I
they take what they want from life
Ooh, but don't mention love
no - just don't mention love!
a rush and a push and the land that
we stand on is ours
your youth may be gone
but you're still a young man
so phone me, phone me, phone me
so phone me, phone me, phone me
Ooh, I think I'm in love...
Urrgh, I think I'm in lerv

 

I STARTED SOMETHING I COULDN'T FINISH

The lanes were silent
with nothing or no one around for miles
I doused our friendly venture
with a hard-faced
three-word gesture
I started something
I forced you into a zone
and you were clearly
never meant to go
hair brushed and parted
typical me, typical me, typical me
I started something
...and now I'm not too sure
I grabbed you by the guilded beams
that's what Tradition means
and I doused another venture
with a gesture
that was...absolutely vile
I started something
forced you to a zone
and you were clearly
never meant to go
hair brushed and parted
typical me, typical me, typical me
I started something
...and now I'm not too sure
I grabbed you by the guilded beams
that's what Tradition means
and now eighteen months' hard-labour
seems...fair enough
I started something
forced you to a zone
and you were clearly
never meant to go
hair brushed and parted
typical me, typical me, typical me
I started something
and now I'm not too sure

 

DEATH OF A DISCO DANCER

The death of a disco dancer
well, it happens a lot 'round here
and if you think Peace
is a common goal
well, that goes to show
just how little you know
The death of a disco dancer
well, I'd rather not get involved
I never talk to my neighbour
I'd just rather not get involved
Love, peace and harmony?
Love, peace and harmony?
Oh, very nice, very nice, very nice, very nice
...but maybe in the next world.

 

GIRLFRIEND IN A COMA

Girlfriend in a coma, I know
I know - it's serious
Girlfriend in a coma, I know
I know - it's really serious
there wree times when I could
have 'murdered' her
(but, you know, I would hate
anything to happen to her)
NO, I DON'T WANT TO SEE HER
Do you really think
she'll pull through?
Do you really think
she'll pull through?
Girlfriend in a coma, I know
I know, it's serious
there were time when I could
have 'strangeled' her
(but, you know, I would hate
anything to happen to her)
WOULD YOU PLEASE LET ME SEE HER!
Do you really think she'll pull through?
Do you really think she'll pull through?
Let me wisper my last goodbyes
I know - IT'S SERIOUS

 

STOP ME IF YOU'VE HEARD THIS ONE BEFORE

Stop me, stop me,
stop me if you think that you've heard this one before
stop me, stop me
stop me if you think that you've heard this one before
nothing's changed
I still love you, oh I still love you
...only slightly less than I used to
I was delayed, I was way-laid
an emergency stop
I smelt the last ten seconds of life
I crashed down on the crossbar
and the pain was enough to make
a shy, bald buddhist reflect
and plan a mass-murder
who said I'd lied to her?
who said I'd lied because I never
who said I'd lied because I never
I was detained, I was restrained
he broke my spleen
he broke my knees
(and then he really laid into me)
Friday night in Out-patients
who said I'd lied to her?
who said I'd lied - because I never
who said I'd lied - because I never
Oh, so I drank one
or was it four
and when I fell on the floor
...I drank more
stop me, stop me
stop me if you think that you've heard this one before
nothing's changed
I still love you, I still love you
but only slightly
less than I used to

 

LAST NIGHT I DREAMT THAT SOMEBODY LOVED ME

Last night I dreamt
that somebody loved me
no hope - but no harm
just another false alarm
Las night I felt
real arms around me
no hope - no harm
just another false alarm
so, tell me how long
before the last one?
and tell me how long
before the right one?
this story is old - I KNOW
but it goes on
this story is old - I KNOW
but it goes on

 

UNHAPPY BIRTHDAY

I've come to wish you an unhappy birthday
I've come to wish you an unhappy birthday
because you're evil
and you lie
and if you should die
I may feel slightly sad
(but I won't cry)
Loved and lost
and some may say
when usually its Nothing
surely you're happy
it should be this way?
I say "No, I'm gonna kill my dog"
and: "May the lines sag heavy
and deep tonight XXX"
I've come to wish you an unhappy birthday
I've come to wish you an unhappy birthday
because you're evil
and you lie
and if you should die
I may feel slightly sad
(But I won't cry)
Loved and lost
some people say
when usually its Nothing
surely you're happy
it should be this way?
I said "No"
and then I shot myself
so, drink, drink, drink
and be ill tonight
from the one you left behind
from the one you left behind...

 

PAINT A VULGAR PICTURE

At the record company meeting
On their hands - a dead star
and ooh, the plans that they weave
and ooh, the sikening greed
At the record company meeting
on their hands - a dead star
the sycophantic slags all say:
"I knew him first, and I knew him well"
Re-issue! Re-package! Re-package!
Re-evaluate the songs
double-pack with a photograph
Extra Track (and a tacky badge)
A-list, playlist
"Please them, please them!"
"Please them! Please them!"
(sadly, THIS was your life)
but you could have said no
if you'd wanted to
you could have said no
if you'd wanted to
BPI, MTV, BBC
"Please them! Please them!"
(sadly this was your life)
but you could have said no
if you'd wanted to
you could have walked away
...couldn't you?
I touched you at the soundcheck
you had no real way of knowing
in my heart I bgged "please, take
me with you...
I don't care where you're going"
But to you I was faceless
I was fawning, I was boring
just a child from those ugly new houses
who could never begin to know
who could never really know
Best of? Most of?
Satiate the need
slip them into different sleeves!
Buy both, and be decieved
climber - new entry, re-entry
World tour! ("media whore")
"Please the Press in Belgium!"
(THIS was your life...)
and when it fails to recoup?
Well, maybe:
You just haven't earned it yet, baby
I walked a pace behind you at the soundcheck
you're just the same as I am
what makes most people feel happy
leads us headlong into harm
so, in my bedroom in those 'ugly new houses'
I dance my legs down to the knees
but me and my 'true love'
we will never meet again...
At the record company meeting
on their hands - at last! - a dead star!
but they cannot taint you in my eyes
no, they cannout touch you now
No, they cannot hurt you my darling
they cannot touch you now
but me and my 'true love'
will never meet again

 

DEATH AT ONE'S ELBOW

Ooh Glenn, don't come to the house tonight
Ooh, Glenn, don't come to the house tonight
because there's somebody here
who really really loves you
stay home
be bored
(it's crap, I KNOW)
Ooh, Glenn, don't come to the house tonight
Ooh, Glen, don't come to the house tonight
because there's somebody here
who'll take a hatchet to your ear
how the frustration renders me
hateful, Glenn!
don't come to the house tonight
don't come to the house tonight
because you'll slip on the
trail of my bespattered remains
and so, that's why
GOODBYE MY LOVE, GOODBYE MY LOVE, GOODBYE MY LOVE...
Belch

 

I WON'T SHARE YOU

I won't share you
I won't share you
with the drive and ambition
and the zeal I feel
this is my time
as the note I wrote
was read, she said
has the Perrier gone
straight to my head
or is life plainly sick and cruel, instead?
"YES!"
No-no-no-no-no-no
I won't share you
I won't share you
with the drive and the dreams inside
this is my time
Life tends to come and go
well, that's OK
just as long as you know
Life tends to come and go
well, that's OK
just as long as you know
I won't share you
I won't share you
with the drive and the dreams inside
this is my time, this is my time

not one talks about castration
We can go for a walk where it's quiet and dry
and we can talk about precious things
like love and law and poverty
these are the things that kill me
We can go for a walk where it's quiet and dry
and we can talk about precious things
but the rain that flattens my hair
theses are the things that kill me
Passed the Pub that saps your body
and the church who'll snatch your money
the Queen is dead, boys
and it's so lonely on a limb
Pass the Pub that wrecks your body
and the church-all they want is your money
the Queen is dead, boys`
you can trust me, boys
life is very long, when you're lonely
life is very long, when you're lonely...

 

PANIC

Panic on the streets of London
Panic on the streets of Birmingham
I wonder to myself
Could life ever be sane again
on the Leeds side-streets that you slip down
I wonder to myself
Hopes may rise on the Grasmeres
But Honey Pie, you're not safe here
So you run down
To the safety of the town
But there's Panic on the streets of Carlisle
Dublin, Dundee, Humberside
I wonder to myself
Burn down the Disco
Hang the blessed D.J.
Because the music that they constantly play
IT SAYS NOTHING TO ME ABOUT MY LIFE
Hang the blessed D.J.
Because the music they constantly play
On the Leeds side-streets that you slip down
On the provincial towns that you jog 'round
Hang the D.J.,. Hang the D.J.,.Hang the D.J...

 

VICAR IN A TUTU

I was minding mind business
lifting some lead off
the roof of the Holy Name church
it was worthwhile living a laughable life
just to set my eyes on a blistering sight
of a vicar in a tu-tu
he's not strange
he just wants to live his life this way
a scanty bit of a thing
with a decorative ring
that wouldn't cover the head of a child
as Rose collects the money in the cannister
who comes sliding down the bannister
the vicar in a tu-tu
he's not strange
he just wants to live his life this way
the monkish monsignor
with a head full of plaster
said "my man, get your vile soul dry-cleaned"
as Rose counts the money in the cannister
as natural as rain
he dances again
vicar in a tu-tu
The next day in the pulpit
with Freedom and Ease
combating ignoranca,dust and disease
as Rose counts the money in the cannister
as natural as rain
he dances again
the fabric of a tu-tu
any man could get us to
and I am a living sign.

 

ASK

Shyness is nice, but
Shyness can stop you
From doing all the things in life
That you'd like to
So, if there's something you'd like to try
ASK ME-I WON'T SAY "NO"-HOW COULD I?
Coyness is nice, but ,
Coyness can stop you
from saying all the things in
life that you want to
If there's something that you'd like to try
ASK ME-I WON'TSAY"NO"-HOW COULD I?
Spending warm, Summer days indoors
Writing fringhtening verse
To a buck-toothed girl in Luxembourg
ASK ME, ASK ME ,ASK ME, ASK ME, ASK ME ,ASK ME
Because if it's not Love
Then it's the Bomb
That will bring us together
Nature is a language-can't you read?
Nature is a language-can't you read?
ASK ME, ASK ME ,ASK ME, ASK ME, ASK ME ,ASK ME
Because if it's not Love
Then it's the Bomb
That will bring us together

 

MARIE'S THE NAME (HIS LATEST FLAME) / RUSHOLME RUFFIANS

Very old friend 
Came by today 
As he was telling everyone in town 
Of all the love that he'd just found 
And Marie's the name (of his latest flame) 
Talked and talked 
And I heard him say 
That she had the longest blackest hair 
Prettiest green eyes anywhere 
And Marie's the name (of his latest flame) 
The last night of the fair 
By the big wheel generator 
A boy is stabbed 
His money is grabbed 
And the air hangs heavy like a dulling wine 
She is Famous 
She is Funny 
An engagement ring 
Doesn't mean a thing 
To a mind consumed by brass (money), oh 
The last night of the fair 
From a seat on a whirling waltzer 
Her skirt ascends for a watching eye 
It's a hideous trait (on her mother's side)
From a seat on a whirling waltzer 
Her skirt ascends for a watching eye 
A hideous trait (on her mother's side) 
Then someone falls in love 
Someone's beaten up 
Someone's beaten up 
And the senses being dulled are mine 
And someone falls in love 
Someone's beaten up 
And the senses being dulled are mine 
This is the last night of the fair 
And the grease in the hair 
Of a speedway operator 
Is all a tremulous heart requires 
A schoolgirl is denied 
She said : "How quickly would I die 
If I jumped from the top of the parachutes ?"
This is the last night of the fair 
And the grease in the hair 
Of a speedway operator 
Is all a tremulous heart requires 
A schoolgirl is denied 
She said : "How quickly would I die 
Oh, if I jumped from the top of the parachutes ?"
...Oh, walk home alone 
I might walk home alone 
But my faith in love is still devout

 

THE BOY WITH THE THORN IN HIS SIDE

The boy with the thorn in his side
behind the hatred there lies
a murderous desire for love
how can they look into my eyes
and still they dont believe me
how can they hear me say those words
and still they dont believe me
and if they don't believe me now
will they ever believe me?
and if they don't believe me now
will they ever believe me?
The boy with the thorn in his side
behind the hatred there lies
a plundering desire for love
how can they see the Love in our eyes
and still they don't believe us
and after all this time
they don't want to believe us
and if they dont believe us now
will they ever believe us ?
andd when you want to Live
how do you start ?
where do you go ?
who do you know?

 

RUBBER RING / WHAT SHE SAID

Yeah! What she says : 
"How come someone hasn't noticed 
That I'm dead 
And decided to bury me ? 
God knows, I'm ready !"
La-la-la ... 
What she said was sad 
But then, all the rejection she's had 
To pretend to be happy 
Could only be idiocy 
La-la-la ... 
What she said was not for the job or 
Lover that she never had 
No no no ... 
What she read 
All heady books 
She'd sit and prophesise 
(It took a tattooed boy from 
Birkenhead 
To really really open her eyes)
What she read 
All heady books 
She'd sit and prophesise 
(It took a tattooed boy from

To really really open her eyes)
What she said : 
"I smoke because I'm hoping for an 
Early death 
AND I NEED TO CLING TO SOMETHING !"
What she said : 
"I smoke because I'm hoping for an 
Early death

No no no no ...

 

IS IT REALLY SO STRANGE?

I left the North 
I travelled South 
I found a tiny house 
And I can't help the way I feel 
Oh yes, you can kick me 
And you can punch me 
And you can break my face 
But you won't change the way I feel 
'Cause I love you, Oh ... 
And is it really so strange ? 
Oh, is it really so strange ? 
Oh, is it really so, really so strange ? 
I say NO, you say YES 
(and you will change your mind) 
I left the South 
I travelled North 
I got confused - I killed a horse 
I can't help the way I feel 
Oh yes, you can punch me 
And you can butt me 
And you can break my spine 
But you won't change the way I feel 
'Cause I love you, Oh ... 
And is it really so strange ? 
Oh, is it really so strange ? 
Oh, is it really so, really so strange ? 
I say NO, you say YES 
(But you will change your mind) 
I left the North again 
I travelled South again 
And I got confused - I killed a nun 
I CAN'T HELP THE WAY I FEEL 
(I lost my bag in Newport Pagnell) 
Why is the last mile the hardest mile ? 
My throat was dry, with the sun in my eyes 
And I realised, I realised 
I could never 
I could never, never, never, go back home again

 

CEMETERY GATES

A dreaded sunny day
so I meet you at the cemetry gates
Keats and Yeats are on your side
A dreaded sunny day
so I meet you at the cemetry gates
Keats and Yeats are on your side
while Wilde is on mine
So we go inside and we gravely read the stones
all those people all those lives
where are they now ?
with loves, and hates
and passions just like mine
they were born
and then they lived and then they died
which seems so unfair
and I wantr to crv
You say: "ere thrice the sun hath done salutation to the dawn"
and you claim these words as your own
but Im well-read, have heard them said
a hundred times (maybe less, maybe more)
if you must write prose/poems
the words you use should be your own
dont plagiarise or take "on loans"
there's alweays someone, somewhere
with a big nose, who knows
and who trips you up and laughs
when you fall
You say: "ere long done do does did "
words which could only be your own
you then produce the text
from whence was ripped
(some dizzy whore, 1804)
A dreaded sunny day
so let's go where we're happy
so I meet you at the cemetry gates
Keats and Yeats are on your side
A dreaded sunny day
so let's go where we're wanted
so I meet you at the cemetry gates
Keats and Yeats are on your side
but you lose
because Wilde is on mine

 

LONDON

Smoke
Lingers 'round your fingers
Train
Heave on - to Euston
Do you think you've made
The right decision this time?
You left
Your tired family grieving
And you think they're sad because you're leaving
But didn't you see the Jealousy in the eyes
Of the ones who had to stay behind?
And do you think you've made
The right decision thins time?
You left
Your girlfriend on the platform
With thei really ragged notion that you'll return
But she knows
That when he goes
He really goes
So do you think you've made
The right decision this time?

 

I KNOW IT'S OVER

I can feel the soil falling over my head 
And as I climb into an empty bed 
Oh well. Enough said. 
I know it's over - still I cling 
I don't know where else I can go 
Over ... 
Oh Mother, I can feel the soil falling over my head 
See, the sea wants to take me 
The knife wants to cut me 
Do you think you can help me ? 
Sad veiled bride, please be happy 
Handsome groom, give her room 
Loud, loutish lover, treat her kindly 
(Though she needs you 
More than she loves you) 
And I know it's over - still I cling 
I don't know where else I can go 
Over, it's over, it's over, it's over 
It's over, la ... 
I know it's over 
And it never really began 
But in my heart it was so real
And you even spoke to me, and said : 
"If you're so funny 
Then why are you on your own tonight ? 
And if you're so clever 
Then why are you on your own tonight ? 
I know ... 
'Cause tonight - it's just like any other night 
That's why you're on your own tonight 
Your triumphs and your charms 
While they're in each other's arms..."
It's so easy to laugh 
It's so easy to hate 
It takes strength to be gentle and kind 
Over, over, over, over 
It's so easy to laugh 
It's so easy to hate 
It takes guts to be gentle and kind 
Over, over 
Love is Natural and Real 
But not for you, my love 
Not tonight, my love 
Love is Natural and Real 
But not for such as you and I, my love 
Oh Mother, I can feel the soil falling over my head...
Oh Mother, I can feel the soil fall over, fall over my head 
Oh Mother, I can feel the ... fall over my ... , Oh ...

 

THE DRAIZE TRAIN

A vastly superior version of the instrumental B-side, acting as a peace 
offering to Marr (Morrissey chose the tracks for the compilation, 
and of course, receives no royalties on this track).

 

STILL ILL

I decree today that life
is simply taking and not giving
England is mine and it owes me a living
ask me why, and I'll spit in your eye
ask me why, and I'll spit in your eye
but we cannot cling to the old dreams anymore
no, we cannot cling to the old dreams anymore
Does the body rule the mind
or does the mind rule the body?
I dunno...
Under the iron bridge we kissed
and although I ended up with sore lips
it just wasn't like the old days anymore
no, it wasn't like those days
am I still ill?
Does the body rule the mind
or does the mind rule the body ?
I dunno...
Ask me why, and I'll die
ask me why, and I'll die
and if you must go to work tomorrow
well, if I were you I wouldn't bother
for there are brighter sides to life
and I should know because I've seen them
but not very often...
under the iron bridge we kissed
and although I ended up with sore lips
it just wasn't like the old days anymore
no, it wasn't like those days
am I still ill?

 

BIGMOUTH STRIKES AGAIN

Sweetness, sweetness I was only joking
when I said Id like to smash every tooth
in your head
Sweetness, sweetness I was only joking
when I said by right s you should be
bludgeoned in your bed
and now I know how Joan of Arc felt
now I know how Joan of Arc felt
as the flames roseto her roman nose
and her Walkman stared to melt
Bibmouth, bigmouth
bigmouth strikes again
and Ive got no right to take my place
with the Human race
and now I know how Joan of Arc felt
now I know of Joan of Arc felt
as the flames rose to her roman nose
and her hearing aid started to melt
Bigmouth, bigmouth
bigmouth strikes again
and Ive got no right to take my place
with the Human race

 
ALSATIAN COUSTIN

Were you and he Lovers?
and would you say so if you were?
on a forecourt
on a Friday
passing my way
Were you and he Lovers?
and if you were, then say that you were!
on a groundsheet
under canvas
with your tent-flap
open wide
A note upon his desk:
"P.S. Bring Me Home And Have Me!"
Leather elbows on a tweed coat
- Oh! -
Is THAT the best you can do?
So came his reply:
"...but on the desk is where I want you!"
So I ask (even though I know):
were you and he Lovers?

 

LITTLE MAN, WHAT NOW?

An afternoon nostalgia
television show
you spoke in silhouette
(but they couldn't name you)
although the panel were
very polite to you
but I remembered you
from Friday nights 1969
ATV - you murdered every line
too old to be a child star
too young to take leads
four seasons passed
and they AXED you
nervously juvenile
(WON'T SMILE!)
What became of you?
did that swift eclipse torture you?
a star at eighteen
and then-suddenly gone
down to a few lines
in the back page of a teenage annual
oh but I remembered you
I looked up to you

 

EVERYDAY IS LIKE SUNDAY

Trudging slowly over wet sand
back to the bench
where your clothes were stolen
this is the coastal town
that they forgot to close down
Armageddon - come Armageddon!
Come Armageddon! Come!
Everyday is like Sunday
everyday is silent and grey
Hide on the promenade
scratch out a postcard
"how I dearly with I was not here"
in the seaside town
...that they forgot to bomb
Come! Come! Come - nuclear bomb!
Everyday is like Sunday
everyday is silent and grey
Trudging back over pebbles and sand
and a strange dust lands on your hands
(and on your face)
Everyday is like Sunday
"Win Yourself A Cheap Tray"
share some greased tea with me
everyday is silent and grey

 

BENGALI IN PLATFORMS

No no no
he does not want to depress you
oh no no no no no
he only wants to impress you
Bengali in platform
she only wants to embrace your culture
and to be your friend forever
Bengali, Bengali
oh shelve your Western plans
and understand that life is hard enough when you belong here
A silver-studded rim that glistens
and an ankle-star that...blinds me
a lemon sole so very high
which only reminds me, to tell you
so I break the news gently
I break the news to you gently
"Shelve your plans"
Bengali, Bengali
its the touchy march of time
that blinds you
don't blame me
don't hate me
just because I'm the one to tell you
that life is hard enough when you belong here
life is hard enough when you belong here
shelve your western plans
life is hard enough when you belong here

 

ANGEL, ANGEL, DOWN WE GO TOGETHER

Angel, Angel
don't take your life tonight
I know they take
and that they take in turn
and they give you nothing real
for yourself in return
and when they've used you
and they've broken you
and wasted all your money
and cast your shell aside
and when they've bought you
and they've sold you
and they've billed you for the pleasure
and they've made your parents cry
I will be here
BELIEVE ME
I will be here
...believe me
Angel, don't take your life
some people have got no pride
they do not understand
the Urgency of life
but I love you more than life
I love you more than life
I love you more than life
I love you more than life

 

LALE NIGHT, MAUDLIN STREET

The last night on Maudlin Street
goodbye house
goodbye stairs
I was born here
I was raised here, and
...I took some stick here
love at first sight
may sound trite
but it's true, you know
I could list the details
of everything you ever wore
or said, or how you stood that day
and as we spend the last night
on Maudlin Street, I say
"goodbye house-forever!"
I never stole a happy hour
around here
Where the world's ugliest boy
became what you see
here I am - the ugliest man
Its the last night on Maudlin Street
and truly I do love you
oh, truly I do love you
When I sleep with that picture of
you framed beside my bed
oh, it's childish and it's silly
but I think it's you in my room
by the bed (...yes, I told you it was silly...)
and I know
I took strange pills
but I never meant to hurt you
oh truly I love you
I came home late one night
everyone had gone to bed
nobody stays up for you
when you have sixteen stitches
all around your head
the last buss I missed to Maudlin Street
so, he drove me home in the Van
complaining: "Women only like me for my mind..."
don't leave your torch behind
power-cuts ahead
as we crept through the park
but no I cannot steal a pair of jeans
off a clothesline for you
but you...without clothes
oh I could not keep a straight face
me - without clothes?
well a nation turns its back and gags...
I'm packed
I am moving house
a half-life disappears today
every slag waves me on
(secretly wishing me gone
well, I will be soon
oh - I will be soon)
There were bad times on Maudlin Street
when they took you away in a police car
dear Inspector - don't you know?
don't you care?
don't you know - about Love?
Your gran died
and your mother died
on Maudlin Street
in pain and ashamed
with never time to say
those special things
I took the keys from Maudlin Street
well, it's only bricks and mortar!
and...truly I do love you
wherever you are
wherever you are

 

SUEDHEAD

Why do you come here
why do you hang around
I'm so sorry
I'm so sorry
Why do you come here
when you know it makes
things hard for me
when you know, oh
why do you come?
Why do you telephone?
and why send me silly notes?
I'm so sorry
I'm so sorry
why do you come here
when you know it makes
thing hard for me
when you know, oh
why do you come?
You had to sneak into my room
'just' to read my diary
was it just to see all the things
you knew I'd written about you?
and...so many illustrations
I'm so very sickened
oh, I am so sickened NOW

 

BREAK UP THE FAMILY

The strange logic of your clumsiest line
stayed emblazoned on my mind
break up the family
and lets begin to live our lives
I went to see all my friends tonight
it wasn't Youth, it wasn't even Life
born Old, sadly wise
resigned (well, we were)
to ending our lives
I'm so glad to grow older
to move away from those awful times
I want to see all my friends tonight
Yes you found love but you weren't
at peace with your life
home late, full of Hate
despise the ties that bind
oh I'm so glad to grow older
to move away from those younger years
now I'm in love for the first time
and I don't feel bad
Let me see all my old friends
let me put my arm around them
because I really do love them
now, does that sound mad?
Captain of games, solid framed
I stood on the touchline
hailstones, driven home
in his car - no breaks? I don't mind
I'm just so glad to grow older
to move away from those darker years
I'm in love for the first time
and I don't feel bad
so wish me luck my friends
goodbye

 

HAIRDRESSER ON FIRE

Here is London
here is London
is it home of the free,
or what?
can you squeeze me
into an empty page of your diary
and psychologically save me
I've got faith in you
I sense the power
in the fingers
within an hour the power
can totally destroy me
or it could same my life
here is London
'home of the brash, outrageous
and free'
you are repressed
but you're remarkably dressed
is it Real?
but you're far to busy
busy scissors
busy clippers
hair dresser on fire
all around Sloane Square
and you're far too busy
to see me
"busy,busy"
hairdresser on fire
was a client over-cautious
he made you nervous
and when he said
"I'm gonna sue you"
I really felt for you
so can you squeeze me
into an empty page of your diary
and supernaturally change me
CHANGE ME, CHANGE ME

 

THE ORDINARY BOYS

Ordinary boys, happy knowing nothing
happy being no one, but themselves
Ordinary girls, supermarket clothes
who think it's very clever to be cruel to you
for you were so different
you stood all alone
and you knew
that it had to be so
avoiding ordinary boys
happy going nowhere, just around here
in their rattling cars
and ordinary girls
never seeing further
than the cold, small streets
that trap them
but you were so different
you had to say no
when those empty fools
tried to change you, and claim you
for the lair of their ordinary world
where they feel so lucky
so lucky, so lucky
with their lives laid out before them
they're so lucky, so lucky
so lucky, so lucky

 

I DON'T MIND IF YOU FORGET ME

I don't mind
I don't mind if you forget me
having learned my lesson
I never left an impression on anyone
so now you send me your hardened 'regards'
when once you'd send me 'love'
sincerely I must tell you
your mild 'best wishes'
they make me suspicious
but I don't mind
I don't mind if you forget me
having learned my lesson
I never left
an impression on anyone
the pressure to change, to move on
was strange
and very strong
so this is why I tell you
I really do understand
BYE BYE
I don't mind if you forget me
no no no no no no no
REJECTION IS ONE THING
BUT REJECTION FROM A FOOL
IS CRUEL
REJECTION IS ONE THING
BUT REJECTION FROM A FOOL
IS CRUEL
and I don't mind if you forget me
I don't mind if your forget me

 

DIAL-A-CLICHE

Further into the fog I fall
well, I was just
following you!
when you said:
"Do as I do and scrap your fey ways"
(dial-a-cliche)
"grow up, be a man, and close your mealy-mouth!"
(dial-a-cliche)
But the person underneath
where does he go?
does he slide by the wayside?
or...does he just die?
when you find that you've organized
your feelings, for people
who didn't like you then
and certainly don't like you now
yet still you say:
"Do as I do and scrap your fey ways"
(dial-a-cliche)
"grow up, be a man, and close your mealy-mouth!"
(dial-a-cliche)
"the Safe way is the only way!
there's always time to change, son!"
yes well I've changed
but I'm in pain!
dial-a-chiche

 

MARGARET ON THE GUILLOTINE

The kind people
have a wonderful dream
Margaret on the guillotine
because people like you
make me feel so tired
when will you die?
when will you die?
when will you die?
when will you die?
when will you die?
because people like you
make me feel so old inside
please die
and kind people
do not shelter this dream
make it real
make the dream real
make the dream real
make it real

 

OUR FRANK

Our frank and open
deep conversations
they get me nowhere
they bring me down, so
give it a rest, won't you?
give me a cigarette
God give me patience
just no more conversation
Give us a drink
and make it quick
or else I'm gonna be sick
sick all over
your frankly vulgar
red pullover
now see how the colours blend
Our frank and open
deep conversations
they get me nowhere
they bring me down, so
give it a rest, won't you?
now will you just give over
the world may be ending
but look, I'm only human
Give us a drink
and make it quick
or else I'm gonna be sick
all over
your frankly vulgar
red pullover
now see how the two colours blend
Won't somebody stop me
from thinking all the time
about everything
so deeply
so bleakly

 

ASIAN RUT

Day oh so late
strangely the sun still shone
oh Asian boy
what are you on?
Day oh so late
strangely the sun still shone
what drugs are you on?
Tooled-up Asian boy
has come here to avenge
the cruel, cold killing
of his very best friend
Tooled-up Asian boy
has come here to take revenge
for the cruel, cold killing
of his only friend
Peace through the school
so quiet in the hall
it's a strange sign for one
of what's to come
Tough and hard and pale
oh they may just impale you on railings
oh English boys
it must be wrong
three against one?
Brakes slammed, and
a gun jammed, and
as far as I could tell
brave Asian boy
dealt a blow and fell
I'm just passing through here
on my way to somewhere civilised
and maybe I'll even arrive
maybe I'll even arrive?

 

SING YOUR LIFE

Sing your life
any fool can think of words that rhyme
many others do
why don't you?
do you want to?
Sing your life
just walk right up to the microphone
and name
all the things that you love
all the things that you loathe
sing your life
all the things that you love
all the things that you loathe
oh sing your life
oh sing your life
Others sang your life
but now's your chance to shine
and have the pleasure of
saying what you mean
the rare pleasure of
meaning what you sing
oh, make no mistake, my friend
all of this will end
so sing it now
all the things you love
all the things you loathe
oh sing your life
all the things that you love
all the things that you loathe
oh sing your, oh sing your
Don't leave it all unsaid
somewhere in the wasteland of your head
and make no mistake, my friend
your pointless life will end
but before you go
can you look at the truth?
You have a lovely singing voice
a lovely singing voice
and all of those
who sing on key
they stole the notion
from you and me

 

MUTE WITNESS

Your poor witness
crying so loudly on the floor
oh but she's only trying to tell you
what it was that she saw
she is only trying to tell you
what it was that she saw
Now see her standing on the table
with her small arms flailing
and you feel such compassion
in your soul for
Your poor mute witness
still testing the strength
of our patience
oh but she's only trying to tell you
what it was that she saw
Now see her pointing to the frisbee
with a memory too fuzzy
as her silent words
describe the fright of last night
4 a.m. Norhtside, Clapham Common
who knows what she was doing there?
will she sketch the answer later?
Well, I'll ask her
"now dry your tears, my dear"
Now see her mime in time so nicely
it would all have been so clear
is only she had never volunteered
"your taxi is here, my dear"

 

KING LEER

Your boyfriend, he
went down on one knee
well, could it be
he's only got one knee?
I tried to surprise you
with Vodka
or, Tizer
I can't quite remember
but you didn't thank me
you didn't even thank me
because you never do
Your boyfriend, he
has the gift of the gab
or, could it be
the gift of the grab?
I tried to surprise you
I lay down beside you
and...nothing much happened
and you didn't phone me
you didn't even phone me
because it's not your style
to dial
Your boyfriend, he
displays to me
more than just
a hint of cruelty
I tried to surprise you
I crept up behind you
with a homeless chihuahua
you gushed for an hour
you handed him back and said
"You'll never guess
I'm bored now"

 

FOUND FOUND FOUND

found found found found found found
someone who's worth it
in this murkiness
someone who's never
seeming scheming
found found found found found found
someone who's worth it
in this murkiness
someone who's never
seeming scheming
Oh, but if I'd never found
oh, but if I'd never found
oh, but if I'd never found
I do believe that
the more you give your love
and I do believe that
the more you offer trust
the more you chase
the more you cry
the more you're bound to lose
the more you're bound to lose
Oh, but if I'd never found
oh, but if I'd never found
somebody
who wants to be
who wants to be
with me
all the time

 

DRIVING YOUR GIRLFRIEND HOME

I'm driving
your girlfriend home
and she's saying
how she never chose you
"turn left", she says
so I turn left
and she says
"So how did I end up
so deeply involved in
the very existence
I planned on avoiding?"
and I can't answer
I'm driving
your girlfriend home
and she's laughing
to stop herself crying
"drive on", she says
so I drive on
and she says
"So how did I end up
attached to this person
when his sense of humour
gets gradually worser?"
and I can't tell her
I'm parking
outside her home
and we're shaking hands
goodnight, so politely

 

THE HARSH TRUTH OF THE CAMERA EYE

Churchillian legs
hair barely there
the harsh truth of the camera eye
Your eyes signal pain
because of the strain
of smiling
the harsh truth of the camera eye
telling you all
that you never wnated to know
showing what
you didn't want shown
My so friendly lens
zooms into
"the inner you"
and it tells the harsh truth
and nothing but
Laugh with us all here
that's if you can
then take the pictures home
and screamtelling you all
that you never wanted to know
showing you what
you didn't want shown
This photographer
he must have really had it in for you
"Oh, I don't want
to be judged anymore
I don't wnat to be judged
I would sooner be Loved
I would sooner be
just blindly Loved..."

 

(I'M) THE END OF THE FAMILY LINE

With no complications
fifteen generations
(of mine)
all honouring Nature
until I arrive
(with incredible style)
I'm the end fo the line
the end of the family line
the end of the line
No baby pulled screaming
out into this seething whirl
by chance or whim
(or even love?)
our family tree hacked into decline
and I'm spared the pain
of ever saying
("goodbye")
I'm the end of the line
the end of the family line
the end of the line

 

THERE'S A PLACE IN HELL FOR ME AND MY FRIENDS

There is a place
reserved
for me and my friends
and when we go
we all will go
so you see
I'm never alone
there is a place
with a bit more time
and a few more
gentler words
and looking back
we do forgive
(we had no choice
we always did)
all that we hope
is that when we go
our skin
and our blood
and our bones
don't get in your way
making you ill
the way they did
when we lived
There is a place
a place in hell
reserved
for me and my friends
and if ever I
wanted to cry
then I will
because I can

 

TONY THE PONY

Still drinking on the corner 
Just don't say I didn't warn you 
Always nagging big brother 
He's only looking out for you 
Tony The Pony 
Tony The Pony 
You're still standing on the corner 
Just don't say I didn't warn you 
Old and jealous big brother 
You had your time and you spent it 
Crying 
Now, Tony The Pony 
Tony The Pony 
So, that's what they call you now ? 
When you're free outside 
So cold and hard and in control 
And ... 
There's a free ride on 
Tony The Pony 
Oh, why do you always wanna stop me 
From doing the things in life that make me happy ? 
And when I'm outside with friends, laughing loudly 
Why do you always wanna stop me ? 
Oh, I would never 
I would never 
But you will carry the can for anyone 
The free ride on 
Gullible Tony 
You're drunker quicker 
And you're sicker even quicker 
For something heavy is gonna fall on you 
Oh ... 
And what do they call you now ? 
When you're free outside 
So cold and hard and in control 
And, oh ... been a lark 
There's a free ride on 
Fucked-up Tony 
I will never say I told you so 
Or how I knew that something bad 
Would happen to you 
I don't wanna say I told you so 
Oh, but Tony, I told you so !!! 
I told you so

 

YOU'RE GONNA NEED SOMEONE ON YOUR SIDE

With the world's fate 
Resting on your shoulder 
You're gonna need 
Someone on your side 
You can't do it by yourself 
Any longer 
You're gonna need 
Someone on your side 
Someone kindly told me 
That you'd wasted 
Eight of nine lives
Oh, give yourself a break 
Before you break down 
You're gonna need someone on your side 
And here I am, And here I am 
Well, you don't need 
To look so pleased ! 
Day or night, 
There is no difference 
You're gonna need someone on your side 
Day or night, 
There is no difference 
You're gonna need someone soon 
And here I am, And here I am 
Well, you don't need 
To look so pleased

 

GLAMOROUS GLUE

First day with the jar 
You find 
Everyone lies 
First day with the jar 
You find 
Everyone lies, nobody minds 
Everyone lies 
Where is the man you respect ? 
And where is the woman you love ? 
Where's the woman you love ? 
Third week with the jar
You find 
Everything dies 
We won't vote Conservative 
Because we never have 
Everyone lies, everyone lies 
Where is the man you respect ? 
And where is the woman you love ? 
Where's the woman you love ? 
Everything of worth 
On Earth Is there To share 
I used to dream, and I used to vow 
I wouldn't dream of it now 
We look to Los Angeles 
For the language we use 
London is dead, London is dead, London is dead...
Now I'm too much in love 
I'm too much in love 
I know 
I'll go 
Empty hand 
From the land

 

WE'LL LET YOU KNOW

How sad are we ? 
And how sad have we been ? 
We'll let you know 
We'll let you know 
Oh, but only if - you're really interested 
You wonder how 
We've stayed alive 'till now 
We'll let you know 
We'll let you know 
But only if - you're really interested 
We're all smiles 
Then, honest, I swear, it's the turnstiles 
That make us hostile 
Oh ... 
We will descend 
On anyone unable to defend 
Themselves 
Oh ... 
And the songs we sing 
They're not supposed to mean a thing 
La, la, la, la ... 
Oh ...You're lonely, Oh ... you're lonely, Oh ... 
GET OFF THE ROOF ! Oh ... 
Your Arsenal !
We may seem cold, or 
We may even be 
The most depressing people you've ever known 
At heart, what's left, we sadly know 
That we are the last truly British people you'll ever know 
We are the last truly British people you will ever know 
You'll never never want to know

 

THE NATIONAL FRONT DISCO

David, the wind blows 
The wind blows ... 
Bits of your life away 
Your friends all say ... 
"Where is our boy ? Oh, we've lost our boy" 
But they should know 
Where you've gone 
Because again and again you've explained that 
You're going to ... 
Oh, you're going to ... 
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah 
England for the English ! 
England for the English ! 
David, the winds blow 
The winds blow ...
All of my dreams away 
And I still say : 
"Where is our boy ? Ah, we've lost our boy" 
But I should know 
Why you've gone 
Because again and again you've explained
You've gone to the ... 
National, ah ... 
To the National .. 
There's a country; you don't live there 
But one day you would like to 
And if you show them what you're made of 
Oh, then you might do ... 
But David, we wonder 
We wonder if the thunder 
Is ever really gonna begin 
Begin, begin 
Your mom says : 
"I've lost my boy" 
But she should know 
Why you've gone 
Because again and again you've explained 
You've gone to the : 
National 
To the National 
To the National Front Disco 
Because you want the day to come sooner 
You want the day to come sooner 
You want the day to come sooner 
When you've settled the score 
Oh, the National 
Oh, the National

 

CERTAIN PEOPLE I KNOW

I take the cue from 
Certain people I know 
I use the cue 
And then I 
Hand it on to you 
And when I swing it 
So, it catches his eye ... 
(Weren't you there ? 
- You'd have died !) 
I trust the views of 
Certain people I know 
They look at Danger 
And they 
LAUGH THEIR HEADS OFF 
Their clothes are Imitation 
George the 23rd 
(Don't you find this absurd ?) 
I'd hate to be like 
Certain people I know 
They break their necks 
And can't afford to
Get them fixed 
Ah, they'd sacrifice all 
Of their principles for 
anything cashable 
I do believe it's terrible 
Oh, wo, wo, Ah, ah, ah, ah, Oh, wo, wo...

 

WE HATE IT WHEN OUR FRIENDS BECOME SUCCESSFUL

We hate it when our friends become successful 
We hate it when our friends become successful 
Oh, look at those clothes 
Now look at that face, it's so old 
And such a video ! 
Well, it's really laughable 
Ha, ha, ha ...
We hate it when our friends become successful 
And if they're Northern, that makes it even worse
And if we can destroy them 
You bet your life we will 
Destroy them 
If we can hurt them 
Well, we may as well ... 
It's really laughable 
Ha, ha, ha ... 
You see, it should've been me 
It could've been me 
Everybody knows 
Everybody says so 
They say : 
"Ah, you have loads of songs 
So many songs 
More songs than they'd stand 
Verse 
Chorus 
Middle eight 
Break, fade 
Just listen ..."
La, la-la, la-la

SEASICK, YET STILL DOCKED

I am a poor freezingly cold soul 
So far from where 
I intended to go 
Scavenging through life's very constant lulls 
So far from where I'm determined to go 
Wish I knew the way to reach the one I love
There is no way ... 
Wish I had the charm to attract the one I love 
But you see, I've got no charm 
Mmm...
Tonight I've consumed much more than I can hold 
Oh, this is very clear to you 
And you can tell I have never really loved 
You can tell, by the way, I sleep all day
And all of my life no-one gave me anything 
No-one has ever given me anything 
My love is as sharp as a needle in your eye 
You must be such a fool 
To pass me by

 

I KNOW IT'S GONNA HAPPEN SOMEDAY

My love, wherever you are 
Whatever you are 
Don't lose faith 
I know it's gonna happen someday 
To you 
Please wait ... Please wait ... Oh ... Wait ... 
Don't lose faith 
You say that the day just never arrives 
And it's never seemed so far away 
Still, I know it's gonna happen someday 
To you 
Please wait ... 
Don't lose faith

 

TOMORROW

Tomorrow 
Will it really come ? 
And if it does come 
Will I still be Human ? 
All I ask of you is one thing that you never do 
Would you put your arms around me ? 
(I won't tell anyone) 
Tomorrow 
Does it have to come ?
All I ask of you is one thing that you'll never do 
Would you put your arms around me ? 
(I won't tell anybody) 
Tomorrow 
And what must come before ...
Oh, the pain in my arms 
Oh, the pain in my legs 
Ooh, my shiftless body 
Tomorrow 
It's surely nearer now ? 
You don't think I'll make it 
I never said I wanted to ! 
Well did I ? 
Oh, the pain in my arms 
Oh, the pain in my legs 
Oh, yeah; oh, yeah, No, yeah; no, yeah 
Through my shiftless body 
Tomorrow, Tomorrow 
All I ask of you ... oh ... 
Is : would you tell me that you love me 
Tell me, tell me that you love me, Tell me, tell me that you love me ... 
Ah, I know you don't mean it 
Ah, I know you don't mean it 
Tell me, tell me that you love me, Tell me, tell me that you love me ...

NOVEMBER SPAWNED A MONSTER

Sleep on and dream of Love
because it's the closest you will get to love
poor twisted child, so ugly, so ugly
poor twisted child, oh hug me, oh hug me
one November spawned a monster 
in the shape of this child who later cried
"But Jesus made me, so Jesus save me from
pity, sympathy and people discussing me"
a frame of useless limbs what can make GOOD
all the BAD that's been done?
And if the lights were out
could you even bear
to kiss her full on the mouth (or anywhere?)
poor twisted child, so ugly, so ugly
poor twisted child, oh hug me, oh hug me
one November spawned a monster 
in the shape of this child who must remain
a hostage to kindess and the wheels underneath her
a hostage to kindess and the wheels underneath her
a symbol of where mad, mad lovers
must PAUSE and draw the line
So sleep and dream of love
because it's the closest
you will get to love
that November is a time which I must put OUT of my mind
oh one fine day 
LET IT BE SOON
she won't be rich or beautiful
but she'll be walking your streets
in the clothes that she went out
and chose for herself

 

SEASICK, YET STILL DOCKED

THE LOOP

I just wanna say 
I haven't been away 
I'm still right here 
Where I always was 
So one day, if you're bored 
By all means call 
Because you can do 
(But only if you want to) 
I just wanna say 
I haven't been away 
I am still right here 
Where I always was 
So one day, when you're bored 
By all means call 
Because you can do 
But you might not get through

 

SISTER I'M A POET

All over this town 
Yes, a low wind may blow 
And I can see through everybo... 
With no reason 
To hide these words I feel 
And no reason 
To talk about the books I read 
But still I do 
That's 'cause I'm a ... Sister I'm a ... 
All over this town 
Along this way 
Outside the prison gates 
I love the romance of crime 
And I wonder 
Does anybody feel the way I do ? 
And is evil just something you are 
Or something you do ? 
Sister I'm a ... Sister I'm a ... 
All over this town, All over this town 
They pull over 
In their Citroen vans 
Not to shake your hand 
With meths on their breaths 
And you with youth on your side 
A plastic bag stranded at the lights 
This once was me ...
But now I'm a ... Sister I'm a ...
All over this town ... Oh, oh, oh 
All over this town, All over this town, Oh ... 
I still cannot speak French ... I am very lazy

 

JACK THE RIPPER

Oh, you look so tired 
Mouth slack and wide 
Ill-housed and ill-advised 
Your face is as mean 
As your life has been 
Crash into my arms 
I WANT YOU 
You don't agree -
But you don't refuse 
I know you 
And I know a place 
Where no one is likely to pass 
Oh, you don't care if it's late 
And you don't care if you're lost 
And oh, you look so tired 
(But tonight you presumed too much) 
Too much, too much 
And if it's the last 
Thing I ever do 
I'M GONNA GET YOU 
Crash into my arms 
I WANT YOU 
You don't agree -
But you don't refuse 
I know you 
And no one knows a thing about my life 
I can come and go as I please 
And if I want to, I can stay 
Oh, or if I want to, I can leave 
Nobody knows me, Nobody knows me, Nobody knows me Oh, oh...

 

SUCH A LITTLE THING MAKES SUCH A BIG DIFFERENCE

Such a little thing, such a little thing
but the difference it made was grave
there you go
wielding a bicycle chain
oh why won't you change
cange and be nicer?
such a little thing
a gentle tone of kindness
or written words on paper
- can you write?
How I love all of
the very simple things of life
(God's good air)
how I love all of
the very simple things of life
such a little thing
a fumbling politeness
the difference it saved me
wielding a bicycle chain
"I WILL NOT CHANGE AND I WILL NOT BE NICE"
Most people keep their brains between your legs (don't you find?)
Leave me alone - I was only singing, leave me alone because
I was only singing
leave me alone - I was only singing, leave me alone
you have just proved (again)
MOST PEOPLE KEEP THEIR BRAINS BETWEEN THEIR LEGS

 

I KNOW IT'S GONNA HAPPEN SOMEDAY

My love, wherever you are 
Whatever you are 
Don't lose faith 
I know it's gonna happen someday 
To you 
Please wait ...

Oh ... Wait ... 
Don't lose faith 
You say that the day just never arrives 
And it's never seemed so far away 
Still, I know it's gonna happen someday 
To you 
Please wait ... 
Don't lose faith

 

WE'LL LET YOU KNOW

How sad are we ? 
And how sad have we been ? 
We'll let you know, We'll let you know 
Oh, but only if - you're really interested 
You wonder how 
We've stayed alive 'till now 
We'll let you know, We'll let you know 
But only if - you're really interested 
We're all smiles 
Then, honest, I swear, it's the turnstiles 
That make us hostile 
Oh ... We will descend 
On anyone unable to defend

Oh ... And the songs we sing 
They're not supposed to mean a thing 
La, la, la, la ... Oh ...
You're lonely, Oh ... you're lonely 
Oh ... 
GET OFF THE ROOF !
Oh ... Your Arsenal !
We may seem cold, or 
We may even be 
The most depressing people you've ever known 
At heart, what's left, we sadly know 
That we are the last truly British people you'll ever know 
We are the last truly British people you will ever know 
You'll never never want to know

 

SUEDHEAD

Why do you come here
why do you hang around
I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry
Why do you come here
when you know it makes
things hard for me
when you know, oh
why do you come?
Why do you telephone?
and why send me silly notes?
I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry
why do you come here
when you know it makes
thing hard for me
when you know, oh
why do you come?
You had to sneak into my room
'just' to read my diary
was it just to see all the things
you knew I'd written about you?
and...so many illustrations
I'm so very sickened
oh, I am so sickened NOW

 

HE KNOWS I'D LOVE TO SEE HIM

He Knows (he knows)
Or, I think he does
because when I lived
in the Arse of the world...
he knows, he knows, he knows I'd love
to see him happy (or as close as is allowed)
because when I lived
in the Arse of the world
he knows, he knows, he knows I'd love
to see him happy (or as close as possible
as close as possible, as close as is allowed)
My name still conjours up deadly deeds
and a bad taste in the mouth
the police - they actually knew me
they said:
"You're just another person in the world
you're just another fool with radical views
you're just another who has maddening views
you want to turn it on its head
by staying in bed!"
I said: "I know I do"

 

YOU'RE GONNA NEED SOMEONE ON YOUR SIDE

With the world's fate 
Resting on your shoulder 
You're gonna need 
Someone on your side 
You can't do it by yourself 
Any longer 
You're gonna need 
Someone on your side 
Someone kindly told me 
That you'd wasted 
Eight of nine lives
Oh, give yourself a break 
Before you break down 
You're gonna need someone on your side 
And here I am, And here I am 
Well, you don't need 
To look so pleased ! 
Day or night, 
There is no difference 
You're gonna need someone on your side 
Day or night, 
There is no difference 
You're gonna need someone soon 
And here I am, And here I am 
Well, you don't need 
To look so pleased

 

GLAMOROUS GLUE

First day with the jar 
You find 
Everyone lies 
First day with the jar 
You find 
Everyone lies, nobody minds, Everyone lies 
Where is the man you respect ? 
And where is the woman you love ? 
Where's the woman you love ? 
Third week with the jar
You find 
Everything dies 
We won't vote Conservative 
Because we never have 
Everyone lies, everyone lies 
Where is the man you respect ? 
And where is the woman you love ? 
Where's the woman you love ? 
Everything of worth 
On Earth, Is there, To share 
I used to dream, and I used to vow 
I wouldn't dream of it now 
We look to Los Angeles 
For the language we use 
London is dead, London is dead, London is dead, ...
Now I'm too much in love 
I'm too much in love, 
I know I'll go 
Empty hand 
From the land

 

WE HATE IT WHEN OUR FRIENDS BECOME SUCCESSFUL

We hate it when our friends become successful 
We hate it when our friends become successful 
Oh, look at those clothes 
Now look at that face, it's so old 
And such a video ! 
Well, it's really laughable 
Ha, ha, ha ...
We hate it when our friends become successful 
And if they're Northern, that makes it even worse
And if we can destroy them 
You bet your life we will 
Destroy them 
If we can hurt them 
Well, we may as well ... 
It's really laughable 
Ha, ha, ha ... 
You see, it should've been me 
It could've been me 
Everybody knows 
Everybody says so 
They say : 
"Ah, you have loads of songs 
So many songs 
More songs than they'd stand 
Verse 
Chorus 
Middle eight 
Break, fade 
Just listen ..."
La, la-la, la-la

 

NOW MY HEART IS FULL

There's gonna be some trouble 
A whole house will need re-building 
And everyone I love in the house 
Will recline on an analyst's couch quite 
Soon 
Your Father cracks a joke 
And in the usual way 
Empties the room 
Tell all of my friends 
(I don't have too many 
Just some rain-coated lovers' puny brothers)
Dallow, Spicer, Pinkie, Cubitt 
Rush to danger 
Wind up nowhere 
Patric Doonan - raised to wait 
I'm tired again, I've tried again, and 
Now my heart is full 
Now my heart is full 
And I just can't explain 
So I won't even try to
Dallow, Spicer, Pinkie, Cubitt 
Every jammy Stressford poet 
Loafing oafs in all-night chemists 
Loafing oafs in all-night chemists 
Underact - express depression 
Ah, but Bunnie I loved you 
I was tired again 
I've tried again, and 
Now my heart is full 
Now my heart is full 
And I just can't explain 
So I won't even try to 
Could you pass by ? 
Could you pass by ? 
Oh ... 
Now my heart is full 
Now my heart is full 
And I just can't explain 
So ... slow ... 
Slow ... slow ... slow ... slow ... slow ...

 

SPRING-HEELED JIM

Spring-heeled Jim winks an eye 
He'll "do", he'll never be "done to" 
He takes on whoever flew through 
"Well, it's the normal thing to do" ... ah ... 
Spring-heeled Jim lives to love 
Now kissing with his mouth full 
And his eyes on some other fool 
So many women 
His head should be spinning 
Ah, but no ! 
Ah, but no ! 
But no !
Ah, no !
Spring-heeled Jim slurs the words : 
"There's no need to be so knowing
Take life at five times the 
Average speed, like I do" 
Until Jim feels the chill 
"Oh, where did all the time go ?" 
Once always in for the kill 
Now it's too cold 
And he feels too 
old 
Too old
Mmm, old... 
La, la, la, la-la, la ...

 

BILLY BUDD

Say, Billy Budd 
So you think you should ? 
Oh, everyone's laughing 
Say, Billy Budd 
So you think that you should ? 
Everyone's laughing ! 
Since I took up with you 
Things have been bad 
Yeah, but now it's 12 years on 
Now it's 12 years on 
Yes, and I took up with you 
I took my job application 
Into town 
Did you hear ? They turned me down 
Yes, and it's all because of us 
Oh, and what was in our eyes 
Oh, what was in our eyes, yeah 
I said, Billy Budd 
I would happily lose 
Both of my legs 
I would lose both of my legs 
Oh, if it meant you could be free 
Oh, if it meant you could be free 
(Don't leave us in the dark!)

 

HOLD ON TO YOUR FRIENDS

A bond of trust 
Has been abused 
Something of value 
May be lost 
Give up your job 
Squander your cash - be rash 
Just hold on to your friends 
There are more than enough 
To fight and oppose 
Why waste good time 
Fighting the people you like 
Who will fall defending your name 
Oh, don't feel so ashamed 
To have friends 
But now you only call me 
When you're feeling depressed 
When you feel happy I'm 
So far from your mind 
My patience is stretched 
My loyalty vexed 
Oh, you're losing all of your friends 
Hold on to your friends 
Hold on to your friends 
Resist - or move on 
Be mad, be rash 
Smoke and explode 
Sell all of your clothes 
Just bear in mind : 
Oh, there just might come a time 
When you need some friends

 

THE MORE YOU IGNORE ME, THE CLOSER I GET

The more you ignore me 
The closer I get 
You're wasting your time 
The more you ignore me 
The closer I get 
You're wasting your time 
I will be 
In the bar 
With my head 
On the bar 
I am now 
A central part 
Of your mind's landscape 
Whether you care 
Or do not 
Yeah, I've made up your mind 
The more you ignore me 
The closer I get 
You're wasting your time 
The more you ignore me 
The closer I get 
You're wasting your time 
Beware !
I bear more grudges 
Than lonely high court judges 
When you sleep 
I will creep 
Into your thoughts 
Like a bad debt 
That you can't pay 
Take the easy way 
And give in 
Yeah, and let me in 
Oh, let me in 
Oh let me ... 
Oh, let me in 
IT'S WAR 
IT'S WAR 
WAR 
WAR 
Oh, let me in 
Ah, the closer I get 
Ah, you're asking for it 
Ah, the closer I get 
Ooh, the closer I ...

 

WHY DON'T YOU FIND OUT FOR YOURSELF

The sanest days are mad 
Why don't you find out for yourself ? 
Then you'll see the price 
Very closely 
Some men here 
They have a special interest 
In your career 
They wanna help you to grow 
And then syphon all your dough 
Why don't you find out for yourself ? 
Then you'll see the glass 
Hidden in the grass 
You'll never believe me, so 
Why don't you find out for yourself ? 
Sick down to my heart 
That's just the way it goes 
Some men here 
They know the full extent of 
Your distress 
They kneel and pray 
And they say : 
"Long may it last" 
Why don't you find out for yourself ?
Then you'll see the glass 
Hidden in the grass 
Bad scenes come and go 
For which you must allow 
Sick down to my heart 
That's just the way it goes 
Don't rake up my mistakes 
I know exactly what they are 
And ... what do YOU do ? 
Well ... you just SIT THERE 
I've been stabbed in the back 
So many many times 
I don't have any skin 
But that's just the way it goes

 

I AM HATED FOR LOVING

I am hated for loving 
I am hated for loving 
Anonymous call, a poison pen 
A brick in the small of the back again 
I still don't belong 
To anyone - I am mine 
And I am hated for loving 
I am haunted for wanting 
Anonymous call, a poison pen 
A brick in the ... ah ... 
A brick in the small of the back again 
I still don't belong 
To anyone - I am mine 
I am falling 
With no-one to catch me 
I am falling 
And there's still 
No-one to catch me 
Ah .. 
Anonymous call, a poison pen 
A brick in the ... ah ... 
A brick in the small of the back again 
I just don't belong 
To anywhere 
I just don't belong 
Mmm ... 
Ah ...

 

LIFEGUARD SLEEPING, GIRL DROWNING

Always looking for attention 
Always needs to be mentioned 
Who does she 
Think she should be ? 
The shrill cry through darkening air 
Doesn't she know he's 
Had such a busy day ? 
Tell her ... sshhh
Somebody tell her ... sshhh 
Slowest ... 
It was only a test 
But she swam too far 
Against the tide 
She deserves all she gets 
The sky became marked with stars 
As an out-stretched arm slowly 
Disappears 
Hooray 
Oh hooray 
No, oh, oh, woh, there's no movement 
No, oh, hooray 
Oh, hooray 
Please don't worry 
There'll be no fuss 
She was ... nobody's nothing 
(What's your name ?) 
When he awoke 
The sea was calm 
And another day passes like a dream 
There's no ... no way 
(What's your name ?)

 

USED TO BE A SWEET BOY

Used to be a sweet boy 
Holding so tightly 
To Daddy's hand 
But that was all 
In some distant land 
Blazer and tie 
And a big bright healthy smile 
Used to make all 
Of our trials worthwhile 
Used to be a sweet boy 
And I'm not to blame 
Something went wrong 
And I know 
I'm not to blame 
Something went wrong 
Can't be to blame 
Ah ...

 

THE LAZY SUNBATHERS

A world war 
Was announced 
Days ago 
But they didn't know 
The lazy sunbathers 
The lazy sunbathers 
The sun burns through 
To the planet's core 
And it isn't enough 
They want more 
Nothing 
Appears 
To be 
Between the ears of 
The lazy sunbathers 
Too jaded 
To question stagnation 
The sun burns through 
To the planet's core 
And it isn't enough 
They want more 
Religions fall 
Children shelled 
"...Children shelled ? That's all 
Very well, but would you 
Please keep the noise 
Down low ? 
Because you're waking 
The lazy sunbathers ..."
Oh, the lazy sunbathers 
The lazy sunbathers

 

SPEEDWAY

And when you slam 
Down the hammer 
Can you see it in your heart ? 
All of the rumours 
Keeping me grounded 
I never said, I never said that they were 
Completely unfounded 
So when you slam 
Down the hammer 
Can you see it in your heart ? 
Can you delve so low ? 
And when you're standing 
On my fingers 
Can you see it in your heart ? ... ah ... 
And when you try 
To break my spirit 
It won't work 
Because there's nothing left to break 
Anymore 
All of the rumours 
Keeping me grounded 
I never said, I never said that they were 
Completely unfounded 
You won't sleep 
Until the earth that wants me 
Finally has me 
Oh you've done it now 
You won't rest 
Until the hearse that becomes me 
Finally takes me 
Oh you've done it now 
And you won't smile 
Until my loving mouth 
Is shut good and proper 
FOREVER 
All of the rumours 
Keeping me grounded 
I never said, I never said that they were 
Completely unfounded 
And all those lies 
Written lies, twisted lies 
Well, they weren't lies 
They weren't lies 
They weren't lies 
I never said 
I never said 
I could have mentioned your name 
I could have dragged you in 
Guilt by implication 
By association 
I've always been true to you 
In my own strange way 
I've always been true to you 
In my own sick way 
I'll always stay true to you

 

THE TEACHERS ARE AFRAID OF THE PUPILS

There's too many people 
Planning your downfall 
When your spirit's on trial 
These nights can be frightening 
Sleep transports sadness 
To some other mid-brain 
And somebody here 
Will not be here next year 
So you stand by the board 
Full of fear and intention 
And, if you think that they're listening 
Well, you've got to be joking 
Oh, you understand change 
And you think it's essential 
But when your profession 
Is humiliation 
Say the wrong word to our children ...
We'll have you, oh yes, we'll have you 
Lay a hand on our children 
And it's never too late to have you 
Mucus on your collar 
A nail up through the staff chair 
A blade in your soap 
And you cry into your pillow 
To be finished would be a relief 
To be finished would be a relief... 
Say the wrong word to our children ...
We'll have you, oh yes, we'll have you 
Lay a hand on our children 
And it's never too late to have you 
To be finished would be a relief 
To be finished would be a relief...
I'm very glad this thing has come 
Sometimes I'm so glad 
Never bother to play the tunes 
I've seen it coming for dear life

 

READER MEET AUTHOR

You don't know a thing about their lives 
They live where you wouldn't dare to drive
You shake as you think of how they sleep 
But you write as if you are my side-by-side 
Reader, meet Author 
With the hope of hearing sense 
But you may be feeling let down 
By the words of defence 
He says : "No-one ever sees me when I cry"
You don't know a thing about their lives 
Books don't save them, books aren't Stanley knives 
And if a fight broke out here tonight 
You'd be the first away, because you're that type 
And the Year 2000 won't change anyone here 
As each fabled promise flies so fast 
You'll swear it was never there 
Oh, have you ever escaped from a shipwrecked life ? 
So safely with your software; all miles from the front line 
You hear the way their sad voices, and you start to imagine things 
Oh, any excuse to write more lies

 

THE BOY RACER

He's just too good-natured and 
He's got too much money and 
He's got too many girlfriends 
I'm jealous, that's all

And I'm gonna ... kill him !
Oh, no ! Oh, no ! Oh, no ! Oh, no ! Oh, no !Oh .... 
Boy racer Boy racer, oh 
We're gonna kill this pretty thing...
He's just too good-looking, and, And, and ... 
Boy racer Boy racer, oh 
We're gonna kill this pretty thing...

 

THE OPERATION

You fight with your right hand 
And caress with your left hand 
Everyone I know is sick to death of you 
With a tear that's a mile wide 
In the kite that you're flying 
Everyone I know is sick to death of you 
Ever since 
You don't look the same 
You're just not the same, no way 
You say clever things and 
You never used to 
You don't catch what I'm saying 
When you're deafened to advice 
Everyone here is sick to the 
Back teeth of you 
With a tear that's a mile wide 
In the kite that you're flying 
Everyone here is sick to the 
Tattoo of you 
Ever since 
You don't look the same 
You're just not the same, no way 
You say pleasant things and 
There is no need to
Still, you fight with your right hand 
And caress with your left hand 
Ooh, ooh ... Sad to say ... 
How once I was in love with you 
Sad to say ... 
You don't catch what I'm saying 
When you're deafened to advice 
Ooh, ooh ... Ever since 
You don't look the same 
You're just not the same, no way 
What the hell have 
They stuck into you ?

 

DAGENHAM DAVE

Head in the clouds, and a mouthful of pie 
Head in a blouse, everybody loves him 
I see why 
Dagenham Dave, Dagenham Dave, Oh, Dagenham Dave 
Dagenham Dave, Dagenham Dave, Oh, Dagenham Dave 
"I love Karen, I love Sharon" on the windowscreen 
With never the need to fight or to question a single thing 
Dagenham Dave, Dagenham Dave Oh, Dagenham Dave 
Dagenham Dave, Dagenham Dave Oh, Dagenham Dave ...
He'd love to touch, he's afraid that he might self-combust 
I could say more, but you get the general idea 
Dagenham Dave, Dagenham Dave Dagenham Dave, Dagenham Dave 
Dagenham, Dagenham Dagenham Dave, Dagenham Dave ...
Oh, Dave, oh, Dagenham, dagenham, Oh, Dave, oh, Dave, ...

 

DO YOUR BEST AND DON'T WORRY

Compare the best of their days 
With the worst of your days 
You won't win 
With your standards so high 
And your spirits so low 
At least remember ... 
This is you on a bad day, you on a pale day 
Just do your best and don't ... Don't worry, oh 
The way you hang yourself is oh, so unfair 
See the best of how they look 
Against the worst of how you are
And again, you won't win 
With your standards so high 
And your spirits so low 
At least remember ... 
This is you on a drab day, you in a drab dress 
Just do your best and don't ... Don't worry, oh 
The way you hang yourself is oh, so unfair 
Just do your best and don't ... Don't worry, oh 
The way you watch yourself is oh, so unfair 
Just do your best and don't ... Don't worry, oh 
Do your best and don't ...

SOUTHPAW

You were a boy before you became a man 
I don't see the joy 
And you ran with your pals in the sun 
You turned around and they were gone 
Again ... 
A sick boy should be treated 
So easily defeated 
Oh, I just don't understand 
So you ran with your pals in the sun 
You turned around 
You were alone 
Again ... 
And you ran back to Ma 
Which set the pace for the rest of your days 
Oh, you ran back to Ma 
Which set the pace for the rest of your days 
Oh, you ran back to Ma 
Which set the pace for the rest of your days 
And now, there is something that you should know 
There is something that you should know 
The girl of your dreams is 
Here all alone 
Girl of your dreams is

The girl of your dreams is 
Sad and all alone

Sad and is feeling all alone 
Oh, there is something that you should know 
Help me, help me, help me ...

 

MALADJUSTED

I wanna start from 
Before the beginning 
Loot wine, "Be mine, and 
Then let's stay out for the night"
Ride via Parkside 
Semi-perilous lives 
Jeer the lights in the windows 
Of all safe and stable homes 
(But wondering then, well what 
Could peace of mind be like ?)
Anyway do you want to hear 
Our story, or not ? 
As the Fulham Road lights 
Stretch and invite into the night 
From a Stevenage overspill 
We'd kill to live around 
SW6 - with someone like you 
Keep thieves' hours 
With someone like you 
...As long as it slides 
You stalk the house 
In a low-cut blouse : 
"Oh Christ, another stifled 
Friday night !"
And the Fulham Road lights 
Stretch and invite into the night 
Well, I was fifteen 
What could I know ?
When the gulf between 
All the things I need 
And the things I receive 
Is an ancient ocean 
Wide, wild, lost, uncrossed 
Still I maintain there's nothing 
Wrong with you 
You do all that you do 
Because it's all you can do 
Well, I was fifteen 
Where could I go ?
With a soul full of loathing 
For stinging bureaucracy 
Making it anything 
Other than easy 
For working girls like me 
With my hands on my head 
I flop on your bed 
With a head full of dread 
For all I've ever said 
Maladjusted, maladjusted 
Maladjusted maladjusted 
Never to be trusted 
Oh, never to be trusted 
There's nothing wrong with you, oh 
...There's nothing wrong with you

 

ALMA MATTERS

So : the choice I have made 
May seem strange to you 
But who asked you, anyway ? 
It's my life to wreck 
My own way 
You see : to someone, somewhere, oh yeah ... 
Alma matters 
In mind, body and soul 
In part, and in whole 
Because to someone, somewhere, oh yeah ... 
Alma matters 
In mind, body and soul 
In part, and in whole 
So the life I have made 
May seem wrong to you 
But, I've never been surer 
It's my life to ruin 
My own way 
You see : to someone, somewhere, oh yeah ... 
Alma matters 
In mind, body and soul 
In part, and in whole 
Because to someone, somewhere, oh yeah ... 
Alma matters 
In mind, body and soul 
In part, and in whole 
To someone, somewhere, oh yeah ... 
Alma matters 
In mind, body and soul 
Part, and in whole 
So to someone, somewhere, oh yeah ... 
Alma matters 
In mind, body and soul 
Part, and in whole 
To someone, somewhere, oh yeah ... 
Oh yeah ... Oh yeah, oh yeah Oh yeah ...

 

AMBITIOUS OUTSIDERS

Bolt-lock your doors 
Alarm your cars 
And still we move in closer 
Every day 
Top of the list 
Is your smiling kids 
But we'll be smiling too 
So that's OK 
Oh, and by the way 
Thank you, because you're 
Giving, giving, giving 
And we're receiving - 
No, no, we're taking 
Keeping the population down 
Your taxes paid, but 
Police waylaid 
And we knows 
When the school bus 
Comes and goes 
We're on your street, but 
You don't see us 
Or, if you do 
You smile and say Hello 
BUT DON'T UNDERESTIMATE US 
When you are 
Giving, giving, giving 
And we're receiving - 
No, no, we're taking 
Just keeping 
The population down 
You're giving, giving, giving 
Well, it's your own fault 
For reproducing 
We're just keeping 
The population down

 

TROUBLE LOVES ME

Trouble loves me 
Trouble needs me 
Two things 
More than you do 
Or would attempt to 
So, console me 
Otherwise, hold me 
Just when it seems like 
Everything's evened out 
And the balance 
Seems serene 
Trouble loves me 
Walks beside me 
To chide me 
Not to guide me 
It's still much more 
Than you'll do 
So, console me 
Otherwise, hold me 
Just when it seems like 
Everything's evened out 
And the balance seems serene 
See the fool I'll be 
Still running 'round 
On the flesh rampage 
Still running 'round 
Ready with ready-wit 
Still running 'round 
On the flesh rampage 
- At your age ! 
Go to Soho, oh 
Go to waste in 
The wrong arms 
Still running 'round 
Trouble loves me 
Seeks and finds me 
To charlatanize me 
Which is only 
As it should be 
Oh, please fulfill me 
Otherwise, kill me 
Show me a barrel and watch me scrape it 
Faced with the music, as always I'll face it 
In the half-light 
So English, frowning 
Then at midnight I 
Can't get you out of my head 
A disenchanted taste 
Still running 'round 
A disenchanted taste 
Still running 'round

 

PAPA JACK

Papa Jack 
Wants to turn 
Back the clock 
And reach out 
To the kids 
He once had 
Who have flown 
Papa Jack 
In decline 
Feels inclined 
To reach out 
To the kids 
He once had 
Who have flown 
But there was a time 
When the kids reached up 
And Papa Jack just 
Pushed them away 
Looking deep 
In his heart 
Papa Jack 
Doesn't like 
What he sees 
Or the time 
On his hands 
The dying day 
The chilly sun 
Papa Jack 
All alone 
Sings slow 
Grieving and low 
But there was a time 
When the kids reached up 
Now you can't always 
Have it your way 
Papa Jack 
Ah ...

 

AMMUNITION

I know these roads 
Each ridge 
And narrow bridge 
Each cheveron 
Enticing me on 
Each warning sign 
I take in my stride 
I don't need more ammunition 
I've got more than I can spend 
I don't dwell on things I'm missing 
I'm just pleased 
With the things I've found 
I know these roads 
An old hand understands 
Above all, I know what's 
Expected of me now 
Veering cliffwards 
I don't need more ammunition 
I've got more than I can spend 
I don't dwell on things I'm missing 
I'm just pleased 
With the things I've found 
With the things I've found 
With the things I've found 
I've found 
I've been crying 
It comes back on these salient days 
And it stays 
And it says : 
"We've never really been away" 
I don't need more ammunition 
I've got more than I can spend 
I don't think of who I'm missing 
I've got no space and no time 
In my life, anymore 
No space or time 
In my life, anymore 
For Revenge

 

WIDE TO RECEIVE

Download something 
Useful, or useless 
Because I'm lying here 
Wide to receive 
Almost anything 
You'd care to give 
And I don't 
Get along with myself 
And I'm not too keen 
On anyone else 
Turn on, plug in 
Then just walk away 
Unlock, process 
And then just go 
And I've never felt quite so alone 
As I do right now 
I'm lying here 
Wide to receive 
Almost anything 
You'd care to leave 
Wide, wide, wide Wide, wide, wide...

 

ROY'S KEEN

(GO ON !)
He's romancing you 
And chancing his arm 
He'll be here 
Smiling on time 
He's romancing you 
And chancing his arm 
He'll be here 
Smiling on time 
Roy's keen oh Roy's keen 
Roy's keen oh Roy's keen 
We've never seen a 
Keener window-cleaner 
Back up the ladder 
Into each corner 
Dunking the chamois 
Just think of the goodwill 
The ladder's a planet 
Roy is a star, and 
I am a satellite 
(But that's alright) 
He can hold a smile for as long 
As you require (even longer) 
He can hold a smile for as long 
As you require (even longer) 
Roy's keen oh Roy's keen 
Roy's keen oh Roy's keen 
We've never seen a 
Keener window-cleaner 
Back up the ladder 
Into each corner 
Dunking the chamois 
Just think of the goodwill 
The ladder's a planet 
Roy is a star, and 
I am a satellite 
I will be set alight 
Don't say you'll hold it steady 
Then you let it go 
Don't say you'll hold it steady 
Then you let it go Oh ...
You're up the ladder 
Into each corner 
Foot in a bucket 
We trust you to wreck it 
Even when it's under your nose 
Well, you just can't 
See it, can you ? 
Well, it's here 
Right under your nose 
And you just can't 
See it, can you? La la la la ...
Roy's keen, Roy's keen La la la la ...
We've never seen a 
Keener window-cleaner 
Oh ... La la la la ...

 

HE CRIED

I need you 
Simple words 
But words which had never been heard 
By the soul 
Stoned to death 
But still living 
And so he froze where he stood 
And he looked to the ground 
And he cried 
He cried 
Ride our minds 
If you must 
But there's always a line you don't cross 
Time is short 
Don't be cruel 
Oh you don't know the power 
In what you're saying 
Oh ... 
And so he froze where he stood 
And he looked to the ground 
And he cried 
He cried 
People where 
I come from 
They survive without feelings or blood 
I never could 
Was stoned to death 
But I'm still living 
So he froze where he stood 
And he looked to the ground 
And he cried 
He cried 
So he froze 
And he looked, and he looked 
To the ground 
And he cried 
He cried

 

SORROW WILL COME IN THE END

Legalized theft 
Leaves me bereft 
I get it straight in the neck 
(Somehow expecting no less) 
A court of justice 
With no use for Truth 
Lawyer ...liar 
Lawyer ...liar 
You pleaded and squealed 
And you think you've won 
But Sorrow will come 
To you in the end 
And as sure as my words are pure 
I praise the day that brings you pain 
Q.C.'s obsessed with sleaze 
Frantic for Fame 
They're all on the game 
They just use a different name 
You lied 
And you were believed 
By a J.P. senile and vile 
You pleaded and squealed 
And you think you've won 
But Sorrow will come 
To you in the end 
And as sure as my words are pure 
I praise the day that brings you pain 
So don't close your eyes 
Don't close your eyes 
A man who slits throats 
Has time on his hands 
And I'm gonna get you 
So don't close your eyes 
Don't ever close your eyes 
You think you've won 
OH NO

 

SATAN REJECTED MY SOUL

Satan rejected my soul 
He knows my kind 
He won't be dragged down 
He's seen my face around 
He knows Heaven doesn't seem 
To be my home 
So I must find 
Somewhere else to go 
So I must find 
Somewhere else to go 
So, take it - please 
It's free 
You'll never see 
You'll never see 
All the fun in life it's cost me 
Satan rejected my soul 
As low as he goes 
He never quite goes this low 
He's seen my face around 
He knows Heaven doesn't seem 
To be my home 
So I must find 
Somewhere else to go 
So I must find 
Somewhere else to go 
So, take it please 
It's really sly 
Come on, come on, ah Come on, come on, come on 
Take it please, It's really sly 
Come on, come on, ah Come on, come on, come on 
Call me in, Pull me in, call me in 
Come on, come on, oh Come on, come on, come on 
Pull me in, pull me in, Call me in, haul me in, pull me in 
Come on, come on, ah, Come on, come on 
La la la la la, Oh ...
